[3:04:03] CyanideSprite: Do donations not read on stream anymore?
[3:04:07] sage_of_senpais: tf top with the 54% winrate or w/e
[3:04:09] derpstevenson: No way you shouldn't get a support item, it's where the free gold and wards come from
[3:04:12] TearsOfMisery: nah its apparently a korean thing ithink. Take dorans item first item for a stronger early lvl then sell and buy supp item on first back
[3:04:22] SEFEROP: is a strategy four some supports
[3:04:33] SEFEROP: in korea
[3:04:47] Komlin111: dont u lose gold tho?

[3:06:43] betocochinito: Sounds pretty troll tbh
[3:06:49] Fractal13rain: its real ^^
[3:06:53] xpoptartt: i think normally you hard force 2v2 level 1 and buy it if u get kills early, but i'm not too sure
[3:06:56] calvus_calverson: you buy doran item to get a stronger lane and go b 350g

[5:46:52] MrShayne: Well in some cultures being formel and calling mister is seen as a way to put distance with the person and they really don't like it/ feel offended Wingsofdeath
[5:48:21] Francois_Fapperino: @MrShayne where i live we touch dongs to say hi
[5:49:15] zzzukin: @MrShayne read their energy after first addressing them by mr. + name, if they seem down with it, ask if it's okay to call them that. if they prefer a different name, they will tell you

[5:51:13] Francois_Fapperino: @friendlycrackdealer ah yes, ive heard of that
[5:51:18] walmartimport: If anyone wondered why Japan is the weakest LoL region in both the player numbers and their eSports presence. One of the reasons listed for this is due to the cultural influence on gaming in Japan, where PC gaming is seen as something not for useful members of society, and PCs are meant for work, whereas consoles are
[5:51:47] friendlycrackdealer: yeah but they have mobile right
[5:52:01] friendlycrackdealer: i thought hte mobile culture was pretty big in japan
[5:52:07] walmartimport: I think they prefer consoles for relaxing
[5:52:18] zzzukin: pc gaming is considered trait of hikikomori
[5:52:25] hotchilly: I. Japan useful meme r of society play nintendo
[5:52:29] Francois_Fapperino: Japan was always bigger on consoles i think
[5:52:34] MrShayne: I would think they like consoles more yes. Chinese are crazy about mobile games
[5:52:59] GuySC: Hikikomori is a real word, but no.. PC gaming isn't part of it.
[5:53:01] zzzukin: its like useless member of society, prefer to shut in away from society
