[1:46:41] enemopeltorkin: !mordekaiser
[1:46:41] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm

[1:49:22] Nightbot: try not to chomp her parry, stay near wall when she ults so she cant get last vital. Not sure if you win level one cause they can just kite. Make sure u do not ult her w extremely important it negates the entire spell everything. DONT q HER W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.

[2:20:13] wontonamo_bae: I think you mainly beat Darius level 1 because he typically starts W, your auto reset is stronger and steals ad. Do you're just a stronger stat stick. But you gotta all in, you can't trade because of the bleed
[2:20:25] LV_Evil: !aatrox
[2:20:26] Nightbot: just stay in ur wave so it pushes to u when he qs u. wait for them to use their passive on a minion. Dodge the sweetspots it worth cancelling an auto dodge. Once you get hull just push ignore him and hit tower.

[2:33:52] hejez: worst ranged match matchup?
[2:33:54] fallenartorias: !fiora
[2:33:54] Nightbot: try not to chomp her parry, stay near wall when she ults so she cant get last vital. Not sure if you win level one cause they can just kite. Make sure u do not ult her w extremely important it negates the entire spell everything. DONT q HER W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
[2:34:09] Y3koub: server?
[2:34:10] Nightbot: NA
[2:34:10] pfandflaschensammlerLevi: how to write illaoi lol

[2:35:56] Bleeky78: !nasus
[2:35:56] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
[2:36:08] iloveteemoo: xD
[2:36:10] Oftenunseen: !illaoi
[2:36:10] Nightbot: dodge her stuff with w. If you’re going to all in her make sure you ult after she hits you with E if she lands it
[2:36:12] fallenartorias: Am i fucked against fiora?
[2:36:22] toooschi: !mordekaiser
[2:36:22] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm
[2:36:29] TrundleTop1: next patch not so much @fallenartorias

[2:37:15] erdojr_: !darius
[2:37:16] Nightbot: just outscale (you win lvl 1 and 6)
[2:37:19] hejez: !garen
[2:37:19] Nightbot: when he comes to q you do W > auto > q you can do this all before his q lands, then when he es just get out of the e asap dont auto him during his E
[2:37:34] erdojr_: !vayne
[2:37:34] Nightbot: just survive dont push vs them
[2:37:46] hejez: !lucian

[2:37:54] TrundleTop1: welcome @erdojr_ trundieYoo
[2:38:07] hejez: !akshan
[2:38:07] Nightbot: when he E's just stay right next to him parallel with whatever wall hes eing onto and it will cancel it because he will bump into you because when he E’s he extends slightly outwards
