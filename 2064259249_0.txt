[1:43:06] SovietWrestler: @maxliquicoty Sounds reasonable to me. That being said, the cynic in me would probably tell you that it's just about time you moved on. But given how it was your first relationship and it sounded serious, then yeah, take your time.
[1:43:13] JessNoobie: LOL
[1:43:16] Kennyl4d: Daddy there is a problem, I don't see stridebreaker and you are yinting

Eventually you'll start moving past it and you'll realize that you can have what you had with this person with anyone given enough time to know them well enough. Having long-term relationships is basically about practicing and not making mistakes that ruin it all.

[1:52:12] maxliquicoty: @AutokratorVIad Thanks Vlad. I really appreciate you taking time. It was first-time everything, I made mistakes but having met someone who showed me affection I went way too fast and ignored many red flags. At some point it was incredibly hard to keep going without second guessing the relationship and I wanted to end it many times myself. But now that it's over there's this feeling like I had a best friend and I will never meet one again. How does what you've had with that person manifest in ano

[1:54:39] Kyoshiana: alright, I go to bed. I have to be up in 4 hours T-T
[1:55:00] SovietWrestler: @maxliquicoty It starts with common interests, possibly mutual friends, shared activities and then basically showing intention of having something more. Being practical about it, that's how relationships work. There is nothing magical about it. And so while I understand why you feel that you had something that is a one-time-in-life-only, in practice it's rarely the case. Trust me.
[1:55:00] Kyoshiana: <3 everyone

[2:01:39] maxliquicoty: @AutokratorVIad Thank you. It was indeed  a lot of rose-tinted, magical and Disney vibes and that was my downfall. I sacrificed everything through everything and. It's interesting that such pain exists and people deal with that. Didn't know there was such grief to be had in the world, or love for that matter.
[2:01:53] blotterboyy: ive never been rock climbing in a gym but ive done like free-climbing out on mountains and stuff and my favorite part is the adrenaline

[2:03:23] roxasthe13thkeyblade: @cowsep Is sundered sky good on yi
[2:03:30] SovietWrestler: @maxliquicoty Overcommitting and not setting boundaries, or as you said, sacrificing "too much" as opposed to having a partner who does less, will always make you feel resentful and potentially make you hate them. I think it's one of the biggest things that go wrong in relationships.
[2:03:39] tipliko: did you watch guys climbing skyscrapers w/o any safety ?
[2:04:00] JessNoobie: LOL

[2:08:09] Flame2hand: Lots of healthy snacks make up the difference
[2:08:10] maxliquicoty: @AutokratorVIad Wow, that's really good to know. I was back and forth a lot. We would wake up in the morning and she would just go on her phone instead of, you know, showing love. Felt like if I wasn't sacrificing my time to do that, no one would. It felt bad not to show affection and love because why be in a relationship. This is a small thing but there were bigger too. During those times I had the feeling like I'm not in a reciprocal relationship. Without guts to voice my needs. By far the har
[2:08:13] spergsy: yeah eating is the hard part I hit around 2000 cals and feel like shit trying to put anything else in me

[2:09:59] spergsy: That's probably sedentary maintenance
[2:10:08] Flame2hand: Yeah 1800 is good amount but also 2500 is probably when you are working out too
[2:10:17] TaLmightyDom: @maxliquicoty did you know love its a chemical you brain does for reproduction love as you tought doesnt exist and when people get in Monogamy for years at some point that chemical goes away then tell me whats left

[2:11:49] tipliko: its all about proteins, you can eat like 2k calories but 200g proteins would work
[2:12:01] SovietWrestler: @maxliquicoty I mean, over time these spontaneous affection acts stop happening so often. I think that's pretty fair and you were probably not on the same page emotionally. Hard to say, but yeah, that's how it happens. You do what you consider ot be a lot, they do less and you start feeling resentful. Like there's an imbalance in the relationship. And it erodes from there on. But don't sweat about it, man. You're young, you'll be fine. Think of it as a good experience to learn from and focus on

[2:48:24] excilerv: we want slow chat function pls daddy
[2:48:38] DiscountBinStreamer: i think as some feed back for your website. You could scale down the "chat box" that you type in by 10-15%. It looks a little to big to me
[2:48:42] gabester322: XD omg
[2:48:45] blacKmarkeTzyrA: @CantyBloke but the endless mookake spam made the world a better place owo

[2:49:29] blotterboyy: i tried resizing the browser to shrink it but it doesnt give me just the chat, it scales the video down too
[2:49:49] blacKmarkeTzyrA: WAYTOODANK
[2:50:31] excilerv: I think you should make a feedback page in the site

[3:20:06] DjTjon: @CelestiialFiend Maybe it's country related aswell
[3:20:09] CantyBloke: yeah coworkers are the easiest friends cause you are stuck together with no choice EZ
[3:20:18] DiscountBinStreamer: how are you able to stay in korea for such a long time? I wanting to move countries

[3:20:57] cahallo: I manifested his recall chat
[3:21:02] DjTjon: Well i think that if you learn the language a little bit better, that really helps in getting a conversation started
[3:21:07] BagboyBrown: @DiscountBinStreamer yes
[3:21:11] DjTjon: And maybe pick-up some more outdoor hobbies?
[3:21:28] CelestiialFiend: someone told me I shouldn't judge people one time. I was like. am I supposed to let anyone be my friend then? like wtf. of course imma judge ppl
[3:21:30] groovie621: When I want to be noticed I go to the same places the same time of the day so if I get a secret admirer I give her the chance to make her move
