[4:28:34] 5AVAGER: @5AVAGER unfortunately not, now it's more auto attack-y builds like sundered, new titanic, bork, tri force, which arent bad but arent as fun imo as max W builds

[5:11:17] comeonconman: from google.
[5:12:12] comeonconman: "As cayenne pepper contains approximately 2.5 mg of capsaicin per gram, you would need to take two to five 500-mg capsules to obtain 2–6 mg of capsaicin."
