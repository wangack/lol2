[2:17:41] nectae: Switch to supp, no?
[2:17:56] MuphinMaster: Jinx masters main here. Kraken -> PD/Hurricane -> IE is a good consistent build
[2:18:01] Ratax: I feel bad for Theo tho. because the supp gap is so big
[2:18:39] nectae: @muphinmaster thank god ur here, holly
[2:18:51] 13pipez: its so cool when jinx presses rightclick and has infinite AS
[2:18:56] violcncc: RIOT
[2:19:06] ddaanbot: @MuphinMaster what would we do without you
[2:19:12] Sirumal: gg
[2:19:28] inspector_guma: agree
[2:19:34] MuphinMaster: Alternatively, if you go alacrity, you should go IE second then PD
[2:19:35] HouseElf7: true
[2:19:36] flitoxxxxxx: Hi can u spaceglid with 7 attack speed
[2:20:35] QuackTheDuck: wtf is spaceglid?
[2:20:57] Kinteshi: you cant really everything is too fast
[2:21:01] 13pipez: spacegliding is kiting basically
[2:21:02] Zifi1: thats some philosophical question right there
[2:21:18] MuphinMaster: spaceglide is when you have enough attack speed to click auto/move as fast as humanly possible
[2:21:18] QuackTheDuck: ive never seen that term before
[2:21:26] olekron: XD
[2:21:30] TIBET1337: streamception

[2:21:54] 13pipez: now we need dantes to go afk post game and look at jacks stream
[2:22:01] Mmatuk5: KEKW
[2:22:06] QuackTheDuck: im watching a stream of a guy watching a stream of a guy watching dantes?
[2:22:14] freynor: The average human reaction speed is around .25 seconds.  7 attacks per second would not allow you to get those attacks in and still click around.  let alone effectively move.
[2:22:44] 13pipez: reaction time has nothing to do with spacegliding
[2:22:44] Zifi1: rip queue Sadge
[2:23:00] xcalebur: dantes is in eu
[2:23:05] spentwalnut: Hola jack, buenos dias
[2:23:08] Kinteshi: why is dantes playing german
[2:23:08] nadra1234: @freynor bro did u see people hit streams in osu? Stuff like that is just muscle memory, has 0 to do with reaction time
[2:23:15] thebuzzzkilla: nope
[2:23:16] MuphinMaster: reaction time and APM are two different things, but yeah, attack speed becomes too much at some point
[2:23:17] Zifi1: o7
[2:23:20] Zifi1: F
[2:23:20] xcalebur: the chats spamming F
[2:23:23] xcalebur: why do you think its you
[2:23:27] Kinteshi: no dantes stream is dedge no
[2:24:04] AdmiralEdgarGorgon: can you do a guide on what hotkeys/setup you use for effective kiting?

[2:24:28] 13pipez: holy its a 4min fist fight
[2:24:32] freynor: @nadra1234 I watch RATIRL do the glides.  Do you think you can attack move with 7 attacks per second?
[2:24:46] MuphinMaster: @jackspektra Do you recommend advance stats over attack move for new players to see auto-spacing?
[2:25:10] MuphinMaster: yes
[2:25:26] 13pipez: use attack move click instead of attack move though
[2:25:28] QuackTheDuck: just A click to attack move no?
[2:25:40] xcalebur: jankos is pretty bad on role
[2:25:41] MuphinMaster: cool, noticed you use advanced stats. I don't see many players using it over the attack-move
[2:25:43] Zifi1: his blitz is goated
[2:25:45] wonderfulturtle: his chogat is nasty Kapp
[2:25:46] nadra1234: @nadra1234 I think with enough practise and changing keybinds it could be done like kogmaw back in the day (w doubled his as if u didnt play then) Also I was just pointing out that there is no correlation between "gliding" and reaction time, 7 attacks per second is for sure not useful
[2:26:05] ddaanbot: got the ultra common NPC here

[2:47:44] xcalebur: whereas this is 1 item
[2:47:45] Deielrion: @demonic_mako going lethality with sundered sky vs a squishy team means he can effectively 2shot people

[2:47:48] demonic_mako: @loddenfps just name me another ranged champ that builds sundered sky that will answer your question

[3:47:25] mono_brown: you wont trigger the penalty
[3:47:26] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[3:48:21] mono_brown: but i thin the thing with multiple sup items where it prevents your enemy team from getting old bounties(the nerf from when janna top was a thing) is still in the game

[3:54:26] NewUsernameBcBan: yuumi with the flash tech?!?!
[3:54:38] Mystic8ball: have seen this build so much on vayne but should stattik just be better? cheaper and wave clear, kinda same dmg?
[3:54:49] flatbun244: @luxneckslitter every question with "my team ints" has one singular answer "get better"
[3:54:55] lattestream: losing 3LP is way better than losing 18LP regardless of who's trolling
[3:55:13] ToneDoLOL: Nemesis build
[3:55:17] Mystic8ball: ye but u got fleet, ghost and you get yomuus later
[3:55:17] squidbub: isnt it -5 for dodge now
[3:55:23] squidbub: @lattestream
[3:55:34] lattestream: 5 is still a lot less than 18 unless my maths is mistaken
[3:55:38] lattestream: but ye idk
[3:55:46] Auris_: regardless tf mindset is that its worth cus his team gets -18 too
[3:55:49] Smack1: u dont lose mmr when dodging
[3:56:02] squidbub: can you demote from dodging at 0 lp?
[3:56:04] Smack1: so dodge lp doesnt matter

[3:58:21] xkat__: or his early game?
[3:58:21] oneshotreceiver: this game makes me so angry just looking at it
[3:58:28] xcalebur: smolder is getting nerfs lol
[3:58:31] jokerfeverpro: that one vote against was vayne
[3:58:39] mono_brown: @Jackspektra If your time is more valueble,shouldnt technically you dodge this game even if you are on the sidewith the normal team comp
[3:58:40] xkat__: yeah no ik i saw the nerfs
[3:58:47] xkat__: but i mean he still feels weird to play

[4:00:43] oneshotreceiver: FirstTimeChatter
[4:00:44] mono_brown: dunno if it will completley kill botted accounts, might make new accounts more expensive
[4:00:48] squidbub: @ImKovixxx what does this mean
[4:00:50] shirooox: jack i finally hit masters after playing since season 2, mostly thanks to watching u BlushHug
[4:00:56] lattestream: vayne splash is Z tier but skin is ass
[4:01:00] luxneckslitter: @Jackspektra hello jack last season i was master 400LP but now im stuck in e1 how do i climb these players are NPCs
[4:01:09] shirooox: not touching this game ever again
[4:01:13] mono_brown: im getting botters are in turbo-mode right now stacking up botted accounts to sell for after vanguardis required
[4:01:19] mams__: @ImKovixxx it's a french expression that doesn't really make sense translated
[4:01:30] nalf: it doesnt change animations so cringe
[4:01:35] Bigslug333: @lattestream i mean its always an ongoing war right? from what i hear vanguard is pretty effective in valo
[4:01:59] oneshotreceiver: having to go to youtube to see skin ingame, thanks riot
[4:02:02] mono_brown: yea valo has the least hackers of any fps game basically
