[1:56:53] Boh14: did you play darius jungle when it was good?
[1:57:21] getsometalentloser: should of saved it
[1:57:27] getsometalentloser: kindred prestige soon
[1:57:47] Tristiiano: was just the clear was obnoxious I think
[1:57:56] Grumpmeister: Normally that would show in the store already that more prestige skins would arrive
[1:58:03] Grumpmeister: So I'm not sure if it'll be part of the pass
[1:58:08] getsometalentloser: @grumpmeister  it is
[1:58:16] getsometalentloser: when the porcalin
[1:58:24] getsometalentloser: stuff comes out in the 21st
[1:58:26] getsometalentloser: or so
[1:58:26] Grumpmeister: I know Kindred Prestige is coming, just I doubt whether it's in the pass
[1:58:30] Tristiiano: yeah you generally want them ahead levels
[1:58:30] getsometalentloser: will be added to pass
[1:58:40] shadow7master: garen ghost predator was scary
[1:58:51] Grumpmeister: Do you have a link to verify it? Just want to make sure before I spend points :P
[1:58:57] Tristiiano: shaco
[1:58:59] getsometalentloser: u can see where it says
[1:59:01] Tristiiano: go shaco bro gg
[1:59:02] getsometalentloser: more chromas to come
[1:59:05] nwa4lifeTV: sniping monkaW
[1:59:07] Grumpmeister: Chromas, yes
[1:59:11] getsometalentloser: that’s for the porcalin
[1:59:11] Jakmo: yuck, this dumb champ
[1:59:15] Grumpmeister: But no 'More prestige skins to come'
[1:59:17] getsometalentloser: they will throw her in there as well
[1:59:22] Grumpmeister: Because that's what normally happens
[1:59:29] shadow7master: elise gonna live top now
[1:59:43] getsometalentloser: cause porcalin falls under the Chinese new year shit
[1:59:59] nwa4lifeTV: gong xi fa cai
[2:00:00] Tristiiano: just report him ahead of time
[2:00:29] Tristiiano: FTW
[2:00:31] shadow7master: is that the galio rank1
[2:00:33] arthalie: Noo, I come in to see edgy datkin boy, I feel like kayn has been cursed for you the past couple days
[2:00:43] Grumpmeister: @getsometalentloser According to Reddit, Prestige Kindred will be in the Mystic Essence store; " It will be in the mythic shop for mythic essence, you can either buy the pass to get the tokens needed to buy the mythic essence or get some from chests."
[2:00:58] Grumpmeister: Which seems likely to me tbh
[2:01:00] Tristiiano: @santorin if enemy team gets kills early I report them for cheating 😂
[2:01:11] getsometalentloser: can’t recall the last time a prestige wasn’t in pass first
[2:01:29] Funkyyfrog: man look at that kayn tongue on his splash art kayngasm
[2:01:36] smartasspawn: kerberos is good tho lets see
[2:02:00] sebastianminiatures: caps takes your LP playing Hwei on your team, now he tries to take it again playing akali against
[2:02:01] arthalie: We need craps not claps today
[2:02:03] smartasspawn: he plays varus vayne a lot yes
[2:02:07] madladzzzz: I always report all mute all just to be sure
[2:02:08] lackmind9: Now he'll be god like because he's on the other team
[2:02:09] Grumpmeister: @getsometalentloser 1,5 months ago with Rakan :P
[2:02:18] jaykills6785: is vayne top a bad pick ?
[2:02:57] Jaguarpaw29: no, it's obnoxious though
[2:03:07] Tristiiano: @santorin would it have been decent to take Elise topside into your topside? perhaps would make Elise not be able to gank it early
[2:03:07] Grumpmeister: @Grumpmeister Ah, this site is also verifying it; Kindred - Porcelain Kindred - 125 ME
[2:03:16] nwa4lifeTV: i prefer the hidden names, less dodges
[2:03:30] getsometalentloser: @grumpmeister  that skin was so dogshit bad I forgot it was a thing

[2:04:21] KayPea: do it santorinDark
[2:04:23] getsometalentloser: I don’t give a shit about ezreal and his dog shit skin
[2:04:29] Boh14: Its worth. Got orbs
[2:04:30] Grumpmeister: Same, I have enough essence and don't feel too pressured with the pass then :D
[2:04:47] arthalie: That's a fishhook ping there (:
[2:04:52] getsometalentloser: I still need the pass cause I used my esscenses
[2:05:00] getsometalentloser: got the taliyah one some@time@ago

[2:07:23] nwa4lifeTV: this is his last resort
[2:08:15] arthalie: Elise thought it was season 5 and there's nothing in pit until 20 minutes
[2:08:26] nwa4lifeTV: wait, so lvl 1 i get dorans into support item once i get fb? cool

[2:54:13] iiNumb3rz: Lee sin has to be a terribly laner right? Qing around a minion wave has to be a pain.
[2:55:13] iiNumb3rz: I always dreamed of getting to a higher elo so my team would play smarter but I quickly learned it's just larger egos.

[3:21:33] arthalie: If Janna is taking that kill this better be a Chad bloodsong vuild
[3:21:54] Jakmo: not fuming at all. I've never been there, don't care to. your toxicity is showing over something that's relative
[3:22:05] getsometalentloser: fuming
[3:22:11] getsometalentloser: over burgers
[3:22:18] getsometalentloser: this world ain’t real
