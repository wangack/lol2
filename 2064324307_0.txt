When he is 3k behind in gold, Sicknerd thinks that he is at a small advantage, and he so he starts a team fight to secure his "lead". When Sicknerd is behind 7k in gold, he thinks that he is at a disadvantage and so he looks for a team fight to regain control of the game. Û†ÄÄ

[5:12:45] Makotoz: @Tyokath it is
[5:12:49] Growl: @Oddishallen arguably at a much worse place now when adc and jgl are autofilled mostly
[5:12:50] Jubling_: Diamond smurf DESTROYS platinum lobbies (he leaves no survivors)

[5:13:24] Jubling_: the killer instinct
[5:13:26] SolasR6: nowayy
[5:13:29] Oddishallen: @Growl True, but at least now a autofill jungle wont cause a match to be onesided with the new catchup
[5:13:40] PsyW54: it will be okay the bad man is gone now manz
[5:13:49] Growl: @Oddishallen rewarded for being bad Sadge

[5:15:59] Deetea86: I doubt catch up xp is a decisive factor in wanting to play jungle or not LUL
[5:16:07] 0dez: tryn 2Head
[5:16:22] Denchy: They got pets in LoL now? O.O
[5:16:30] 0dez: @Denchy jungler item
[5:16:37] Jubling_: I think it makes it feel less worse to play consistently so people are less panicked about being autofilled, it's a slow boi thing
[5:17:03] Growl: @Deetea86 I think its more in the sense of not needing to watch a Stonewall008 video before picking a jungler LUL the pets help a lot so you can have some build / rune variety, even if not optimal
