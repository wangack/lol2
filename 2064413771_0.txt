[0:46:44] Arisutra: performance*

[0:47:55] Darkcyter: kaypFreya
[0:47:56] GoodGamerCharles: But hey about 50% of us won the gamba!
[0:48:02] som963: i went 0-8 last week now i am 9-8 lol what is this season
[0:48:03] torge_154: hi @kaypea kaypPengu
[0:48:08] sovitiaisavampire: how? sub 85 times in a row
[0:48:08] funkopoptony: another ziggs game?
[0:48:09] sovitiaisavampire: thats how
[0:48:11] sovitiaisavampire: Keepo
[0:48:15] Arisutra: i think performance-based LP gains would suck if you end up in a hard counter lane
[0:48:15] kristykat_: @Darkcyter kaypCheer
[0:48:19] Darkcyter: kaypLove
[0:48:20] pearpudding: aşkım naber
[0:48:21] Flinkehh: No it doesnt he welcomed me on my first day!
[0:48:29] guiltyprawn: Not a boost, Vlad is elo inflated. I was browsing his and Janna's history. Most of their matches were bot diff victories. The Janna was good. And her past games have been too. The vlad wasn't so kaypSpy
[0:48:33] pearpudding: hello kay <3
[0:48:35] torge_154: @darkcyter kaypPengu kaypPengu
[0:48:45] Mamicrack_: The birrrrrb
[0:48:47] torge_154: @darkcyter WB kaypHello
[0:48:50] Arisutra: unless it's more based around how you perform in the midgame, teamfights, etc
[0:49:00] via_trita: hard counter lane would be easy to off set if you just played safe once you knew the diff in skill
[0:49:07] Darkcyter: Now to celebrate your weird wink from yeterday, I did a meme 😁
[0:49:13] Dracjko_Moon: Hola Kp and chat peepoHey
[0:49:22] Darkcyter: @Dracjko_Moon kaypHello

[0:49:33] torge_154: Hi @kaypea
[0:49:42] BiSettual: Overall performance?
[0:49:48] Dracjko_Moon: Darkcyter hey hey lunavt2Hug
[0:49:52] yayevee: Like if I'm getting an S but we still lost, I shouldn't lose 30 LP 😢
[0:49:59] Lenox013: after a while your own MMR could be used as a weight - like if you do well against Lissandra as Ahri then you'd take a harder hit if you did poorly against a Liss
[0:50:00] moonlightaurelia: In Valo they have a performance bonus with your lp gains, so maybe league can implement that if you are consistent?
[0:50:03] funkopoptony: carrying the team
[0:50:04] Darkcyter: meme on discord
[0:50:07] via_trita: that vi and sara was drunk with how they were playing
[0:50:12] gigachadgodsu: I think its also a bot champ diff, lucian and janna falls off hard
[0:50:32] enemopeltorkin: catJAM
[0:50:36] via_trita: hows that vs tho?
[0:50:48] Nicolajbruhn: HeyGuys HeyGuys

[0:50:59] Darkcyter: @Nicolajbruhn kaypHello
[0:51:10] splinter7649: Vision score as well?
[0:51:41] Jaguar542: CC score, gold efficiency
[0:51:41] jimbob_ywert: If people only care about KDA in a team game where only winning matters then they’ll truly never climb. Damage done, warding, cs, all these factors should matter more into giving your grade. imo KDA isn’t important, unless you’re playing norms aiming for that m7
[0:51:43] Darkcyter: @Funny4455 @Lenox013 kaypHello kaypHello
[0:51:48] Dracjko_Moon: I hate the person who invented emerald, it is the worst rank there is monkaHmm
[0:51:49] Femuline: i find most games i don’t hit S when i thought i would, it was bc my CS was shit
[0:51:56] splinter7649: You're always an S+ in our eyes 😍
[0:52:12] WorlldSinger: i read that with that champ in that position you need to compare to the overall stats of everyone else who plays that position and you need to be better in every aspect
[0:52:28] torge_154: @splinter7649 kaypComfy
[0:52:31] WorlldSinger: been playing udyr jungle and i get an A+ a lot but finding it so hard to get an S
[0:52:39] ahribabyy: i gain22 and losee 31
[0:52:39] jimbob_ywert: Why is autofill a thing in RANKED 😭
[0:52:50] torge_154: Can I ask who made your Emotes for the Chat? kaypPengu
[0:52:53] via_trita: i haven't played in a while but im pretty sure vs is a big factor because they use that as a base metric team contribution
[0:53:01] chelseadappee: hello! been a while
[0:53:07] shedfirekid1: honestly it should be +20 and -20. you either climb or you drop. Dont need varying LP
[0:53:09] DeepInCryo: i remember the first time i got loss mitigation when I had an afk. felt so good
[0:53:31] jimbob_ywert: kaypHello kaypWOW kaypFlower kaypMega kaypRiot
[0:53:45] nicolasxduarte: What about kaypShame
[0:53:48] aPhatPhoenix: True, I was jungle the other day 21-8 and got every single objective and 2nd most damage on team and I only got an A

[0:56:20] romsteak2174: i think it would be fair
[0:56:30] kristykat_: @KayPea Did you see that tweet by RiotPhroxzon? talking about losers queue doesn't exist and all this blah blah
[0:56:36] GoodGamerCharles: If you played like a god and you had a teammate troll, have them lose 2 more, and you lose 2 less so same amount of lp
[0:56:38] fuzzlion: hiiiii
[0:56:45] jimbob_ywert: it’s always Joe fuckety shnmoe 🤦‍♂️ riot ban pls
[0:56:50] via_trita: small indie companies, don't listen to the people that actually play the game, just wan the money
[0:56:53] aPhatPhoenix: I think the grades also depends on the champ. if your playing a champ that normally has a good kda, your KDA and CS has to be even better than the norm.
[0:56:56] Darkcyter: @Scooby_Dooby_Dew WB
[0:57:01] Darkcyter: @fuzzlion kaypHello
[0:57:03] chelseadappee: joe-fuckity-shmoe is so funny

[0:57:26] kristykat_: yeah that was some BS!!!
[0:57:31] leagueoflegoboy99: kay pea . how did u become a real life walking talking emoji ?
[0:57:34] jimbob_ywert: how would riot matchmaking against you work?
[0:57:46] Darkcyter: @lilJellyBeanie kaypHello
[0:57:50] keepUpBoo: hi kp, hi chat! how u guys doing today? kaypFlower
[0:58:08] Jaguar542: Phreak is the lead of the Riot balance team
[0:58:17] GoodGamerCharles: "git gud"
[0:58:18] yayevee: KEKhands
[0:58:24] xBoomShotBaby: he needs to be fired kaypWHAT
[0:58:24] Darkcyter: Riot - "git gud"
[0:58:32] kristykat_: I was kaypAnnoyed reading through it
[0:58:38] torge_154: this tweet rito kaypRiot
[0:58:43] Ashura__Oni: Hi Kp
[0:58:45] kristykat_: talking some fatty bs
[0:58:53] Lenox013: I'd think that Riot would want to say that loser's queue DOES exist - because if it doesn't, then their matchmaking and balance teams need to be canned because they are just awful
[0:58:56] ballyh0o: in my honest opinion, smurfing is what ruins all of matchmaking.
[0:59:09] ballyh0o: at least below diamond level
[0:59:11] MelihBravery: hello everyone
[0:59:39] kristykat_: frr
[0:59:39] WorlldSinger: i have a friend who just did placements, he lost all 5 games, in 2 of those games he went 0-14, in another he went 0-8 and then the last 2 he got a few kills and he got placed Gold 2. I don't know how placements work.
[0:59:42] funkopoptony: yeah i really dislike how the matchmaking works
[0:59:44] The1997wiki: i have no idea why somethink like autofill exist why should play a role you not main like
[0:59:46] yanjii: Hello!
[0:59:46] Darkcyter: @ballyh0o kaypHello
[0:59:51] chelseadappee: it feels like their team dosnt even play the game anymore

[1:00:07] romsteak2174: they don’t even try to pretend it’s on purpose xD
[1:00:09] SkottyBones: lux
[1:00:23] jimbob_ywert: but isn’t like matchmaking random? like how would they match make people against you? Does riot adjust every game being created? I’m confused on the concept 😭
[1:00:24] torge_154: eww Swain kaypRiot
[1:00:26] ballyh0o: @Darkcyter  kaypHello
[1:00:30] splinter7649: Play Vlad 😅
[1:00:45] jimbob_ywert: that feels like an anivia game 3 tanks
[1:00:56] Sneakupp: i have stoped palying league for more that 3 years now (playing mostly tft now), and yet here i am most of your streams still enjoying it :P  thanks for that :D
[1:01:17] inSINwetrust: Say no to the last one nezReally
[1:01:21] markella_andri: Victor for victory <3
[1:01:38] WorlldSinger: we're all baffled, he is very new, like he's only been playing for a few weeks so to be fair hes still learning, like only just got to 30 the other day
[1:01:38] guiltyprawn: Algorithms to make everything into 50% wr
[1:01:48] torge_154: VIKTORy
[1:01:49] ShadowVixenXO: I'm just trying to improve and climb out of silver on my level 700+ account and I cant go a single game without a smurf on the enemy team
[1:02:05] DeepInCryo: promo curse algorithm is alive and well
[1:02:07] DragonOfSorrow: matchmaking is a joke. Every time I play Naafiri to learn I'm ALWAYS against a one trick
[1:02:08] kristykat_: YESSSSS
[1:02:12] Darkcyter: @ShadowVixenXO @inSINwetrust kaypHello kaypHello
[1:02:15] MiyukiKowa: are they going to fix where you recall back to a fountain and when the enemy tries to stop your recall but doesnt and the delay hits you in fountain?
[1:02:27] MDelighted: the worst is that this is all because riot basically profiles you and thinks you belong to a specific elo and you can barely crawl out of it
[1:02:31] DeepInCryo: i went on a 14 game win streak. hit the next rank and immediately had 2 afk in my next games
[1:02:46] jimbob_ywert: oh lol, it reminds me the pattern of how every single game in the week is usually 4-1 and weekend games are almost always 1-5
[1:02:48] sohku24: And don't get me started with emerald games, it's cursed put here
[1:03:04] inSINwetrust: You do notbhave proof (now) umbraHmm
[1:03:06] gigachadgodsu: Oh naur Lucas was on a lose streak too 1-5
[1:03:13] gigachadgodsu: Riotttt do sumthinnn
[1:03:22] ShadowVixenXO: I was gatekept out of gold in my promos 5 times before I gave up even trying for a long time
[1:03:37] ShadowVixenXO: by afks and literal rage inters
[1:03:37] nicolasxduarte: That song reminds me of twilight idk why
[1:03:45] torge_154: amm what was that play of the enemys kaypMega
[1:03:49] kristykat_: I was stuck at s1 99lp for the longest time and everytime i got into promos to gold I lost every game
[1:03:57] Arisutra: @nicolasxduarte muse have a song in twilight
[1:04:02] Arisutra: supermassive black hole
[1:04:04] DeepInCryo: promo curse was just moved to the first games of your rank up
[1:04:06] Arisutra: don't ask how i know that
[1:04:19] atichii: hi kp
[1:04:22] arcadedani: i am so tired today i swear...

[1:05:16] meowththesecond: happy friday! honestly that tweet was as gaslighting as them saying on some champ release they wanted to make lux players lives miserable (idk if i used the word gaslight correct)
[1:05:35] Infernolol69: i think matrix is attacking soloq
[1:05:52] kakashiX18: Cheer100
[1:05:53] torge_154: Idk why but I love the autos of this skin kaypFlower
[1:06:13] Eldas_Algoris: did they say why they removed promos ?
[1:06:14] Arisutra: i think the smurfing and boosting going on doesn't help
[1:06:22] kakashiX18: You are very welcome
[1:06:41] SkottyBones: I pretty much exclusively play arams and TFT now because ranked league makes me cringe so hard
[1:06:53] gretchen2137: i got plat last season and now i started off with silver II and couldnt get into gold and some fuck ass rioter said that ppl who got plat last season will be placed in silver @KayPea
[1:07:05] paraxona: Ranked is just not fun anymore.
[1:07:10] paraxona: which is hella sad paraxoCry
[1:07:12] Hymuno: really scary that they are still lying about this stuff when vanguard is about to be in lol and they are just saying "oh we won't look at your data, don't worry" lol
[1:07:20] meowththesecond: yeah on champ release they at least admitted to it but it kinda felt the same energy to me
[1:07:33] markella_andri: Casino?
[1:07:35] Arisutra: i dislike being in games where someone on my team is clearly on that tank down after getting boosted
[1:07:35] HaybeeV: I dont understand riot placing fresh accounts into plat its so frustrating
[1:07:44] ballyh0o: isnt there promos above diamond still? or did they take them out completely?
[1:07:45] torge_154: @paraxona nowayCry2
[1:07:45] yanjii: For me the biggest paradox is a champion like K'sante, they release a champion who doesnt die, build only armor and mr but still deals fuck ton of damage and has bilion of dashes, people give me an argument 'but adcs deal milion of dmg its not fair' yeah, but they also take as much
[1:07:48] Arisutra: like, i get they have to be in someone's games, but why mine? :( haha
[1:08:04] leagueoflegoboy99: yeah ur 100% a  emoji
[1:08:06] Arisutra: @yanjii i love playing k'sante, awkward
[1:08:15] ughmarty: basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI
[1:08:16] HelloOctoberly: for me the most frustrating thing is knowing that I'm good enough to get back to my former peak ranks but also knowing it may not be possible on the same account.
[1:08:27] The1997wiki: how does he has 2 kill swain ?
[1:08:29] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: Nice this songs comes on while im playing Borderlands
[1:08:32] inSINwetrust: You described Bruisers in a nutshell
[1:08:39] Hymuno: this song makes me want to play borderlands 1
[1:08:41] SickeningTouchLoL: what do you think of the new champ coming into league from arcane you think she’ll be broken? @kaypea
[1:08:53] jimbob_ywert: I do believe in a sense that most people are in the rank they deserve, proof for this is looking at players in each division, like comparing emerald players to diamond there’s a drastic difference. a Reddit post recently has done the stats
[1:09:03] Ba_kari: is this Aladin song
[1:09:16] The1997wiki: with his w lol he got it i think
[1:09:23] Arisutra: wait what
[1:09:27] Arisutra: who is coming from arcane?
[1:09:29] Arisutra: sevika?
[1:09:29] ughmarty: which one is the new champ ?
[1:09:45] SickeningTouchLoL: what percent chance do you think she will have a dash.? @kaypea
[1:09:47] chelseadappee: mels mom
[1:09:52] yanjii: Me I was a diamond player last season, but right now im going  back and forth between e3 and e4 while each game being like 14/5
[1:09:54] alexlossfps: hey what is rank atm?
[1:09:56] WorlldSinger: Ambessa Madarda
[1:09:58] itsSoley: Ummm
[1:10:00] Nadro: wtf is this
[1:10:01] itsSoley: what was that
[1:10:04] motta95: bruh
[1:10:06] Jaguar542: ss support and jg
[1:10:09] nicolasxduarte: There's a party
[1:10:18] Arisutra: mel's mum as a champ but no mel herself?
[1:10:20] shedfirekid1: I think they don’t like you very much. just a guess
[1:10:33] kiyo_ev: isn't always a party in midlane ? sadge
[1:10:44] GSamwise: I mean you can be 14/5 in all your games, if you are just taking kills and doing nothing after it like drakes or going botlane or w/e it's nor a surprise
[1:11:07] viliviki: that was scary
[1:12:02] Arisutra: the fact only win streaks/loss streaks seem to actually noticeably affect mmr feels bad
[1:12:39] SickeningTouchLoL: I feel like autofill Keeps people from their true rank because it makes people play lanes that they have little to no knowledge of.
[1:13:00] InuyashaMarco: I did this exact thing I’m silver/gold on my main and new account I got placed in emerald
[1:13:24] jimbob_ywert: well that just sucks for me kaypAnnoyed been playing since season 9

[1:14:07] Femuline: i did my first ranked match last year on my main acc and got iron, then this year got placed bronze. but then i make a new account and i place gold. shows that my old accounts MMR just tanked basically lolz
[1:14:15] romsteak2174: wow i'm impress
[1:14:20] Jaguar542: Blitz just wanna hug catiecHug
[1:14:21] romsteak2174: good job KP
[1:14:44] ShadowVixenXO: I'm giving up on my main account ranked for that exact reason
[1:14:50] ShadowVixenXO: gonna play a new account
[1:14:56] ShadowVixenXO: my main makes me depressed
[1:14:58] FiveFM: kaypHello Good afternoon
[1:15:05] HelloOctoberly: Bronze 3 main. Gold 1 after 1 placement on new account

[1:15:07] ShadowVixenXO: but thats where all my skins are D:
[1:15:24] yanjii: didn't they add this season the 'performance bonus' points? but i dont feel it at all lmao
[1:15:33] Neaxz: Impressively good.
[1:15:37] Neaxz: 10 winstreak
[1:15:55] HelloOctoberly: @ShadowVixenXO saaame. this is why im done buying skins. I'm so sad about all the money i wasted
[1:16:02] WWClown: time to buy some antiheal for swain
[1:16:07] inSINwetrust: The more you win, the bigger the impact of the loss nezNod
[1:16:08] zoki_2706: Kelsi that's not true..I lost 8games in a row then get 6win in a row my mmr is still insane and im placed above my rank last season so only riot know how that shiet work
[1:16:23] ahribabyy: @Neaxz wish i could say the same:(
[1:16:25] YohioLol: YohioLol subscribed with Prime. 
[1:16:30] chelseadappee: ive watched a guy on stream go from 99 lp almost to diamond lose one game bc of his tristana  inting. then lose all the way to plat 4. its honestly depressing
[1:16:47] Jaguar542: That drake was Smolders friend in dragon school, how could you kill it :(
[1:17:32] w0wzors: On my main I have to play like 120 games to hit gold 4. on a brand new account i leveled to 30 i got placed in Gold 2 after 1 match lmao
[1:17:44] ShadowVixenXO: yeah I'm not gonna buy an account, I think thats one of the things wrong with League, I dont support it xD
[1:17:49] ughmarty: omg tea
[1:17:57] yanjii: I feel so true. there are rarely games for me when I feel its genuily close, its either a hard stomp or just lost from the beggining
[1:18:15] Arisutra: you'll earn more MMR if you beat people with an MMR higher than you, than if you beat people with an MMR lower thanyou, yeah
[1:18:21] w0wzors: My main is from Season 3
[1:18:27] Arisutra: since you're "expected" to win those games
[1:18:29] HelloOctoberly: omg what is with the ability to FF so early now too. I had 2 games ff'd at 18 minutes. totally winnable
[1:18:33] w0wzors: it went about 6 seasons not touched
[1:18:59] UthatNOOB: people cba to try cuz they are tilted @HelloOctoberly
[1:19:25] SeaOfKiLLeR: nice dodge
[1:19:26] GodCorrin: because you are placed after 1 match now you will *almost* always get gold, because its average. you will trend back towards your real rank over a long enough time
[1:19:38] ughmarty: basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI basiilHAPPIHAPPIHAPPI
[1:19:40] tomerang: hey KP!! was just watching your YouTube vid. hope you are having a good day today
[1:19:42] ughmarty: basiilNOTED basiilNOTED basiilNOTED basiilNOTED
[1:19:47] Arisutra: is gold actually the average?
[1:19:49] tomerang: I finally hit plat!! kaypLunaRage kaypLunaRage
[1:19:52] Arisutra: like, where the most players are?
[1:20:17] YamiCF: how is gnar doing against Jax in the top lane?
[1:20:17] angelofdeathjonathan: Most players are iron-silver
[1:20:30] HelloOctoberly: ugh. its the worst. especially when they ff away your 34 lp.
[1:20:32] GodCorrin: @Arisutra yes silver/gold are average
[1:20:45] zezoyoussef2: You are the only girl who plays well in this game
[1:20:45] nicolasxduarte: !cannon
[1:20:45] Nightbot: KayPea has missed: 1216 cannon minions Clap
[1:20:46] houseofbalioons: I'm like that lol
[1:20:52] tomerang: the best games are the ones where you are shaking at the end and are like “what just happened?”
[1:21:01] WorlldSinger: and longer games are more fun because you can get to your potential and actually feel strong
[1:21:06] Arisutra: @GodCorrin gonna call my mum and let her know i'm finally above average at something :')
[1:21:14] inSINwetrust: Life is hard already. I need my games easy nezWeasel
[1:21:26] GodCorrin: @Arisutra great work gamer
[1:21:37] jimbob_ywert: that Annie ult was so good rip
[1:21:38] sohku24: Gnars w
[1:21:40] shedfirekid1: was the sej passive?
[1:21:44] The1997wiki: yeah
[1:21:51] velcro_is_cool: gold is like top 50% of players which is about where silver was before this past season i think
[1:21:52] YamiCF: possibly, or sejuani’s E
[1:22:03] Teekwan: Hello friends, hello miss @KayPea I just came back from work, bought a few goodies to treat myself, and i accidentally ordered a Bubble Tea whit all the colors of your logo. It was a sign, clearly kaypFlower PopNemo
[1:22:15] jeroenvijver: Hi Hi errybody <3
[1:22:35] SickeningTouchLoL: I’ve been hard stuck silver for ever than got gold than I got put back to silver than randomly I got plat which shocked me I guess riot wanted to be nice to me.
[1:22:46] Jaguar542: Imagine going out of laning phase with a score of like 2/2/3, and top and bottom just smashed their opponents, and ever teamfight is an easy win. That game is just a boring win.
[1:22:53] jeroenvijver: hows gaming going today?
[1:23:17] Thanedor: im still trying to climb back to plat, and almots 200 games int his season just so i can duo with my friend who climbs with me (they are emerald)
[1:23:23] GSamwise: I think it's not only just mates that int your games, I went to 99lp emerald 1 to emerald 2 16lp but honestly I was not playing that good and here I am now back in Emerald 1 36lp with 6 wins streak just because I decided to focus and play better (xNightcall is my account you can take a look I'm ahead everytime and carry my team)
[1:23:29] jeroenvijver: ohno D:
[1:23:34] YamiCF: how was the landing phase for Jax?
[1:23:46] jeroenvijver: nice gj :D
[1:23:56] Teekwan: I mean, i first realised those could be also the colors of bisexual pride flag, but i do stan both :3
[1:24:15] jeroenvijver: KP getting richhh
[1:24:15] nicolasxduarte: Goooold
[1:24:26] jeroenvijver: ur team scales like maniac so i still believe :D
[1:24:33] HelloOctoberly: sending my tilted teammates to KP'
[1:24:35] GSamwise: My point is ; don't wait for others to carry your games you have to be the best version of yourself and carry them no matter what
[1:24:36] HelloOctoberly: s mental boot camp
[1:24:40] zezoyoussef2: Your position is perfect
[1:25:01] Darkcyter: @jeroenvijver @HelloOctoberly @YamiCF kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[1:25:12] torge_154: why Arent you playing Duo with Lucas sometimes?
[1:25:13] jeroenvijver: @Darkcyter kaypComfy kaypLove
[1:25:34] tfyu2: i thought your mmr was based off your performance
[1:25:39] HelloOctoberly: hi @Darkcyter
[1:25:40] jimbob_ywert: it’s weird because I’m silver 1 and gaining 31 LP and losing 22
[1:25:45] Arisutra: i lowkey think they need separate ranks for each role
[1:25:59] gretchen2137: *anything wierd or bad happens in league* everybody: RIOOOT
[1:26:09] Arisutra: i'm a plat adc but i sure as shit ain't a plat jungler
[1:26:11] markella_andri: Riot give me 13 loss streak but 3 win streak.. Ridiculous
[1:26:16] tim_the_cake: I miss Viktor's old Hexcore system
[1:26:22] Thanedor: @tfyu2 if it was then things would be much different
[1:26:30] torge_154: Didn’t know sorry
[1:26:35] shan_192: kaypHYPERS
[1:26:38] tomerang: what do you think is the hardest/easiest role to climb in?
[1:27:02] NoPainNoDane: HELLOO KAYPEAAA :)
[1:27:04] tim_the_cake: give me back Hexcore Mk3 lol
[1:27:19] jeroenvijver: there is almost always a way to climb back from being behind in games if ur whole team is wiling to go for that comeback
[1:27:23] GSamwise: I only have one account and I'm playing since season 3, i'm wining 18/19 lp and losing more than 20 I have 54% w/r in solo queue BUT I have 71% with Vi jungle, so I'm just playing Vi now
[1:27:30] WorlldSinger: joe fuckity shmoe back at it again, sounds like he's the common denominator
[1:27:36] karrden: Maybe not THAT Joe, but he has SO many clones :D
[1:27:36] shyven_: this joe is a problem istg
[1:27:36] jimbob_ywert: justice for Joe. he just went 4/7 last game, He’s improving, GIVE HIM A BREAK!
[1:27:37] Teekwan: I ended up in b4 after placements, and idk my dude, i just don't feel the crushing weight of the ranked anymore, i'm just here for free shiit
[1:27:39] imangtv: not every champ can 1 v 9 so it hard for mage and support player to carry
[1:27:42] Jaguar542: Should fed players move slower?
[1:27:45] guiltyprawn: Curse Joe fcktyshmo for making me lose every... single... game!!!! Nerdge
[1:28:08] GSamwise: more than 200 don't judge me
[1:28:14] romsteak2174: have you ever tried tft?
[1:28:24] Arisutra: if it wouldn't get me banned, i'd changed my acc name to fuckityshmoe#joe right now hahaha
[1:28:31] WorlldSinger: Nasus got them big long legs
[1:28:36] inSINwetrust: But he does speed up
[1:28:40] WorlldSinger: Big Susan
[1:28:41] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: So I am sorry I have been half listening, as I am at work. It sounds like rank, semi depends on how many ranked seasons you have played sometimes, so someone who has played a lot but just recently got into ranked may be lower then someone who just plays ranked?
[1:28:43] Jean_Pichon: i was wondering what makes you say riot wants to keep you at a 50% winrate, like is there concrete proof of that?
[1:28:45] GunzaPrime: pretty16DANCE pretty16DANCE pretty16DANCE
[1:28:45] jeroenvijver: new game mode kaypCaptainMaple
[1:28:46] NoPainNoDane: Gold 3 karma support and getting 33 Lp per game atm :)
[1:28:47] Frozenfruit13: chogath would never move again
[1:28:49] Jaguar542: Should getting ulted by Lulu decrease movespeed?
[1:28:52] Thanedor: I'm almost 200 trying to get to plat still. My friend says, "You'll be back in plat in no time." But games keep going south with teammates
[1:29:09] Teekwan: Everyone except Sett, man's working out, he should be able to carry that much weight and still run
[1:29:15] SickeningTouchLoL: yeah when I play Nasus I can get wrecked in my lane but as long as I have 300+ stacks I become unkillable.
[1:29:31] shan_192: niice kaypHYPERS
[1:29:32] nicolasxduarte: lol the flash
[1:29:34] Arisutra: nice flash gnar
[1:29:35] jeroenvijver: what game was gnar playing? XD
[1:29:38] jimbob_ywert: did you just 1v1 a gnar
[1:30:05] via_trita: gnar showed respec
[1:30:09] jeroenvijver: ggs :D
[1:30:12] jeroenvijver: scaling teammmmm
[1:30:14] Jaguar542: Victory LuvHearts
[1:30:14] FiveFM: Feeling a little “Gnarish”? Try more laser in your diet!
[1:30:19] nicolasxduarte: Yaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssss
[1:30:21] romsteak2174: GG
[1:30:23] nekrojiji: you are winning?   very nice
[1:30:29] karrden: The solution was friendship
[1:30:31] FiveFM: kaypCheer
[1:30:37] Arisutra: joe sitting there on the enemy team fuming rn
[1:30:40] inSINwetrust: rooSip
[1:30:49] nekrojiji: you were getting farmed before  I went for food
[1:30:52] FiveFM: kaypSip
[1:31:17] mr_andrew292: Hi kay
[1:31:22] jimbob_ywert: WOAHHH +20 THATS INSANE
[1:31:25] romsteak2174: Riot check your stream Kappa
[1:31:36] jeroenvijver: the music o-o
[1:31:44] Arisutra: your normal games mmr is used for your first 5 placement games, after that they're independent
[1:31:46] inSINwetrust: rooRave
[1:31:55] jaxwhale123: happy Friday finally
[1:32:12] chelseadappee: DinoDance
[1:32:48] jeroenvijver: but why does riot like reset mmr then so u have a fresh chance to get higher than u were before since u improve over time?
[1:32:53] Arisutra: yeah, the normal games you play on your first ever acc will be you learning the game haha
[1:32:53] jeroenvijver: doesnt*
[1:33:01] tim_the_cake: It makes it hard to climb then
[1:33:04] Arisutra: but with a fresh one, you'l know the game
[1:33:05] via_trita: yeah, they don't take in to account of current improvement, you'd have to show consistency in the improvement of a few seasons in order to improve
[1:33:18] jimbob_ywert: so basically a fresh account shows you your deserved rank more reliably?
[1:33:21] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: That makes sense, I have had the same acct since I was was like 17 and im 28 now and obviously have improved but its looking at the games when I was just kind of screwing around and playing versus now being older trying to be ranked.
[1:33:26] inSINwetrust: Hard reset is too much work and while another clusterfck
[1:33:34] inSINwetrust: Whole*
[1:33:37] Thanedor: I just like how I'll win 3 times in a row, lose 1 game, alose enough LP to 30+ and my mmr dips down to say "Hey you should be in silver" and my gains get worse.
[1:34:09] WorlldSinger: i got placed silver 4, was essentially a new account, created a while ago but only got to level 30 a couple weeks ago
[1:34:24] SickeningTouchLoL: my lp gain is 31 and loss is 21.
[1:34:35] jeroenvijver: so basically, if u go on a big loss streak. u cant ever do ranked on ur account anymore??
[1:34:59] jaxwhale123: i finally hit plat this season
[1:35:01] thosty23: so have a learning acct?
[1:35:06] jimbob_ywert: that sucks,I have so many skins on my main
[1:35:07] angelofdeathjonathan: Basically jeroenvijver
[1:35:09] Lenox013: My main is from season 3 - I can't play anything but bots and ARAM on it - even the normal games are borked
[1:35:12] via_trita: new season, new me, new account lol
[1:35:12] Arisutra: @jeroenvijver depends how early into the life of the acc it is
[1:35:13] inSINwetrust: But you could be a Challenger hardstuck gold, too rooGold
[1:35:13] Jean_Pichon: i don’t know, like loose streaks may happen as much as win streaks. I went from d4 to d2 due to a loose streak last season but reached master after that, like your mmr can drop quickly but can also improve quickly imo
[1:35:25] jeroenvijver: @Arisutra got it
[1:35:49] mKingEagle: mKingEagle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! That purple makes your eyes look so good
[1:36:17] meowththesecond: i think from a bussiness standpoint they are aware of it and know that people are also aware of it, what im trying to say i guess is they want to people make more accounts and sell more skins to the same people
[1:36:18] Jean_Pichon: d2 to d4*
[1:36:37] ShadowVixenXO: first split last season I had a 75% winrate at one point and was gaining 15 losing 30
[1:36:47] Smoothcollie: Hey guys kaypHello
[1:36:47] zoyjo: hi, im thinking about tft ranked also, there i never feel like stuck in a rank some seasons i play less and iam gold when i play more and try hard i geet to high dimaond even more, i know tft is different cuz u play alone but still the ranked system seems so different
[1:36:55] thosty23: so mmr is compared to lp?
[1:37:18] Arisutra: @thosty23 mmr and your rank are linked but not the same
[1:37:26] ashbringerw3: kaypFreya
[1:37:27] angelofdeathjonathan: MMR affects LP gains and loses
[1:37:32] Thanedor: So I gain 22 on win and -32 on loss
[1:37:40] Thanedor: am I hardstuck with my primary account while my friend is off in emerald land?
[1:37:48] Thanedor: well ony account*
[1:38:18] Smoothcollie: 10/3/8. U see the 3 deaths kaypShame that's why u lost kaypShame
[1:38:26] thosty23: matchmaking on any game is broken
[1:38:30] Jean_Pichon: Hhmm i get your point, it would be actually very interesting if riot would tell how their mmr computation work, unfortunately i don’t think they did it :(
[1:38:45] Femuline: riot basically said “you should be good enough to 1v9 all games to challenger ok?”
[1:38:50] Post_Maclone: TFT is vastly different.  super easy to fix MMR
[1:38:54] jeroenvijver: its the annoying thing about team based games
[1:39:00] Post_Maclone: 10 games or less top 4 and youre are back on track
[1:39:05] jimbob_ywert: Tft is more balanced
[1:39:10] jimbob_ywert: it’s not team reliant
[1:39:24] jeroenvijver: i had a ranked game where every lane of mine won except for my toplane that wen 3-25 into a trynda and he just ran everyone down
[1:39:31] angelofdeathjonathan: TFT I win a lot more
[1:39:40] Lenox013: I'm pretty sure TFT has a soft reset to MMR each "season"
[1:39:57] controldevil__: Hi! if you were a teletubbie. What movie would you put in your tummy?
[1:40:13] jeroenvijver: yea if i get carried in valorant, i gain like 10 lp because i didnt do well
[1:40:18] olson869: League has become Riot's red headed step child
[1:40:37] inSINwetrust: Wtf?
[1:40:39] karrden: what does that even mean ?
[1:40:40] Arisutra: I'd put Alien in my tummy and terrorise tubbyland
[1:40:46] inSINwetrust: rooHUH
[1:40:53] jeroenvijver: lmao
[1:41:01] controldevil__: HAHA i would put scream 1 or 4

[1:45:31] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: @angelofdeathjonathan <3
[1:45:34] Arisutra: only one that could reasonably play into a bot lane i reckon

[1:46:22] GSamwise: The first season I played I was silver, the next season I was gold then Platinium then Diamond 2 when Grandmaster was not a thing and then I kind of dropped LOL so I was gold 4 or 5 seasons and here I am try harding lol for the first time since years. So yeah it's a bit hard for me to go higher because my account has a gold/plat mmr but yeah I'm just playing the champ I'm the best at rn
[1:46:23] Femuline: yesterday i bought frozen heart as veigar against ad tf mid and was very happy w the results
[1:46:25] JustCaptainMimmy: @DXSMOKINGMONKEY congrats fam

[1:49:08] lawfulevil_13: Armored pen right out of the gate
[1:49:12] Lenox013: @DXSMOKINGMONKEY my main recommendation for preparation that I give to all new parents - have a bunch of easy to prepare meals ready for the first week or two after the little one arrives - we froze lasagna, soup, enchiladas, casseroles, etc. - there's so much going on that having good, easy to make food is super helpful
[1:49:15] shyven_: is the malph going ap or tank
[1:49:22] JustCaptainMimmy: mal mid is annoying
[1:49:26] jeroenvijver: time to play some rock paper scissor against the rock
[1:49:29] jimbob_ywert: The shield is armor no? so don’t your abilities go through it
[1:49:37] Arisutra: assume he's going AP or they have no AP damage
[1:49:43] shyven_: @jimbob_ywert it's hp
[1:49:54] tacobean1: Okay Kels, I'm gonna go take a nap, I'll see ya next time. Love you dude
[1:49:56] jimbob_ywert: @shyven_ oh then that sucks
[1:50:03] theenation97: hey @kaypea how have the games been today?
[1:50:05] JustCaptainMimmy: i am happy next patch Ahri will take another buff
[1:50:21] shyven_: @jimbob_ywert i think the only armor shield in the game is camille's passive
[1:50:21] arcadedani: nice
[1:50:22] FiveFM: @jeroenvijver Well, mostly paper. The other two… not so good.
[1:50:23] jimbob_ywert: NICEEE

[1:51:51] jimbob_ywert: KP, give me your honest opinion. I main Zoe mid and I’m picking a second champ to have in my pool (I want 2 champs only). Would it be better to have Orianna or Asol? I like Orianna for her playstyle but I love Asol for his lore and character design. it’s hard to choose :p
[1:52:48] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: @Lenox013 i appreciate it! we are very fortunate to have a lot of family that lives within 30-45 minutes so we will hopefully have a lot of help as well. I fully expect to be doordashing a lot XD

[2:32:40] King_OfHarts: have you tried banning yasuo? i heard thats the key
[2:33:10] Arisutra: haha, your rank after going 3/13 is around where i am rn on my adc acc
[2:33:25] jimbob_ywert: I started banning yasuo and went on a 17 game win streak!
[2:33:32] nicorasenpai: do you prefer this ludens or the other ludens @KayPea ?
[2:33:55] Sniipesttv: and it doesn’t help as support roam to help another lane come back and adc feeds 4 kills then blames me for not playing safe like am I wrong?
[2:34:12] King_OfHarts: old ludens was so goated
[2:34:30] Smoothcollie: How is the Ludens after buff? Better than stormsurge?
[2:34:32] Arisutra: @Sniipesttv will depend, it's not always right to roam (source: old bard main here)
[2:34:38] kontishu: im really hungry but my talentless ass cant cook what do yall recommend i get? shawerma or pizza?
[2:34:41] rebelaspect: hiiii just had an interview! you're still online yay!

[2:35:21] Smoothcollie: kaypSnipe
[2:36:00] rebelaspect: yess, actually im excited, but pay isnt optimal
[2:36:03] Arisutra: giving up early assumes your opponents will play perfectly with their lead (and, spoilers, they probably won't)
[2:37:00] King_OfHarts: ok?
[2:37:15] Arisutra: dude, zed just wanted a hug and you do him dirty like that?

[2:43:32] rebelaspect: it's always good, but particularly good today
[2:43:44] Martybggg: i think its the low ground bs that makes it hard to hit
[2:44:03] Rikutochi: jhin is a fool
[2:44:05] darjar12: wtf
[2:44:05] Niomah: ew
[2:44:11] Niomah: She's married @1234sacha

[2:44:34] leggingsPT: Hello kp hello everyone
[2:44:37] TyrTheTiny: aww I missed the drama
[2:44:42] King_OfHarts: with this playlist i feel like i own a firebird with a cooler in the backseat
[2:44:43] JustCaptainMimmy: wtf
[2:44:49] Niomah: Just a creeper @TyrTheTiny
[2:44:55] milorambaldi87: every time I ping to pull the drag out and get ignored…. enemy jg smites it from the other side of the wall
[2:45:05] sajmonstepien: Perfectly bated
[2:45:05] kontishu: god damn the perma cc you gave to that akali
[2:45:07] milorambaldi87: like…. why don’t people listen?!?!
[2:45:07] TyrTheTiny: @Niomah I wanna know anyway
[2:45:10] sajmonstepien: Oh no
[2:45:28] King_OfHarts: is it full ap diana or tank hybrid
[2:45:45] FiveFM: The Barney Stinson Get Hyped playlist plus
[2:45:53] rebelaspect: jhin on adc mentality and main character mind
[2:45:53] GSamwise: Still waiting to hear a Blink-182 or Sum 41 songs to go CRAZY
[2:45:59] TyrTheTiny: that was so upsetting, let's flame
[2:46:19] kontishu: theres gross shit and theres yasuo
[2:46:22] King_OfHarts: adc's are wild (i say as an adc main dont tell anyone)
[2:46:22] sajmonstepien: God I love that song soo much
[2:46:49] Cut_n_Run: @TyrTheTiny if you really want the so see that sort of twit, you can use FFZ or bttv options to see timed out messages
[2:47:32] TyrTheTiny: @Cut_n_Run idk what any of those are, but thanks for feeding my drama hunger
[2:47:42] BeeRhy: he is three levels up tho
[2:47:44] kontishu: zed and yasuo are my perma bans
[2:47:45] 0Becko: 3 lvl diff
[2:47:49] lilJellyBeanie: dude took 0 turret damage
[2:48:10] Cut_n_Run: @TyrTheTiny wait, you dont have the google addons that give you additional emotes?
[2:48:10] milorambaldi87: I’ve been playing AP Twitch lately and it’s been pretty fun
[2:48:10] sajmonstepien: Assassin shit I guess
[2:48:37] Darkcyter: @TyrTheTiny better ttv setting from bottom right of this chat, the cog icon I mean, you can enable showing deleted messages
[2:48:39] TyrTheTiny: @Cut_n_Run nope
[2:48:41] reginaphalange00: sometimes he appears on the side for some reason
[2:49:14] Goriyay: zed things
[2:49:23] Goriyay: even when u outplay it dont work
[2:49:28] its_clamor: i hate playing against a zed
[2:49:29] Cut_n_Run: KEKhands @TyrTheTiny ohhh makes me sad
[2:49:41] milorambaldi87: unrelated… but hear me out…. turret hits should do % of health damage. there’s no reason why tanks can just take 5-6 hits and aren’t even 1/2 hp
[2:49:52] lawfulevil_13: High damage games play like a mobile moba. Just weird
[2:49:54] lilJellyBeanie: the amount of burst feels worse than before. it’s literally either do nothing or it’s 100 to 0 immediately
[2:49:56] sajmonstepien: I guess he was supposed to appear behind you but u moved a bit so it wasn't the same direction as ur q
[2:49:59] TyrTheTiny: @Cut_n_Run do i have to install someone? Is this why I read people writing "kekhands" isntead of the actual emotes?
[2:50:07] Goriyay: that wsa actually nice on jhins part
[2:50:14] fluffycloudlove: hey everyone hope yall doing good
[2:50:40] milorambaldi87: had a Maokai get turret aggro’d and just stood there while team tore down the turret. like probably 6 hits from the tower and wasn’t even phased
[2:51:05] TyrTheTiny: KP BACKDOOR LET'S GOOO
[2:51:12] Cut_n_Run: @TyrTheTiny yeah thats exactly why i see an emote, you see the words. franker faceZ or better twitch tv are the addons, i prefer FFZ because its maintained more, but you can have both
[2:51:20] sajmonstepien: I thought u're gonna run to beat the nexus xddd
[2:51:24] baPIMPski: why don’t you build storm surge?
[2:51:26] rebelaspect: i mean, from what ive seen, you didnt do poorly, just theyre full of assassins that focus you, so it may feel like you didnt do as well
[2:51:36] BannedGrill: i feel like tanks are worst now...
[2:51:36] konitos: hello KP! long time since I tuned in, good luck at your games :))

[3:25:16] TheLiin: im experimenting with skipping ROA, i dont like the item
[3:25:39] MartyDaxnger: your team is just gonna have to reenact the end of the lord of the rings and let you carry them out of mordor idk
[3:26:02] TheLiin: roa just delays more important items
[3:26:15] WolfieKronos: im on a win streak rn !!! Im on a 17 game win streak and I jumped 3 ranks. I went from Bronze 3 to silver 4
[3:26:20] aAerides: Feel like Udyr and you are imposters in wood division tbf

[3:27:50] TheLiin: anivia is such a good champ for holding them off from ending though
[3:27:51] WolfieKronos: @MartyDaxnger I find ROA is good as a 3rd or 4th item. I find building it first or second negates damage.
[3:28:06] xBoomShotBaby: and all of a sudden he is left speechless
[3:28:11] DragoonRed: jax did just 1v1 udyr
[3:28:24] HydroMerano: Yeah because they need you for teamfights, without you they been losing them. Lol

[3:30:07] LyonAoi06: Why everytime You try ti push they start a TF .-.
[3:30:08] jonasbuhl: how is your day KP? <3
[3:30:10] jimbob_ywert: your responses are always so sassy lol
[3:30:10] HydroMerano: Jax doesn't understand how you helping push back bot, it gave you easier prio for drag
[3:30:15] HydroMerano: but yeah, its not worth it.
[3:30:20] kaithegemini: jax needs to spend less time typing and more time focusing
[3:30:20] mountainnking: a
[3:30:32] just_jordannn: idk why he's so mad though, when your single handedly keeping your team in the game
[3:30:41] WolfieKronos: if he had 25 kills then id consider wha hes saying but he annoying as hell
[3:30:42] just_jordannn: like he's mad at you because he's bad
[3:31:11] manuel_alfonso: mad cuz bad
[3:31:16] TheLiin: @WolfieKronos going seraph boots + 4 masks does more dmg and gives more health than roa seraph liandrys boots
[3:31:44] CoustouNA: he is typing xd
[3:32:01] xBoomShotBaby: seemed like he was typing before recalling yah
[3:32:05] TheLiin: team perma fighting without you doesnt help

[3:33:08] FiveFM: Well, everyone on your team aside from Jaxx acknowledged that you were doing well! ggs
[3:33:09] TheLiin: @WolfieKronos its because after the item changes, the passive on mask that gives +2-6% dmg stacks

[3:47:58] KatV9: Kay is back at it :^)
[3:48:46] FiveFM: Essence > Manamune > Navori is the most popular build... but situationally I'm afraid I have no idea. Use at own risk.
[3:49:11] Niomah: Navori is good yeah
[3:49:26] Niomah: Anything on hit is basically go
[3:50:02] Niomah: Vayne doing Vayne things
[3:50:16] Jaguar542: Fulllllll  AP!
[3:50:37] KatV9: mid game Kay just no dying anymore
[3:51:06] iMadCuzBad: No F vayne??
[3:51:28] KatV9: poke her as much as possible
[3:52:05] Goriyay: kaypez back we love to cx it
[3:52:16] FiveFM: drat
[3:52:19] ggmelius: ggmelius subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Guten Abend KP! :3
[3:52:35] KatV9: yeah he didnt get the control of the lane before lvl 3
[3:52:38] KatV9: its honestly on mao tbh
[3:52:40] Bogdicool: Think Janna and Maokai are S tier rn
[3:52:40] Sunnytinker: i feel like it will be much better too when you have more cd
[3:52:43] jimbob_ywert: Janna counters maokai
[3:52:50] xLippyy: oh Em Gee i made it to a strim
[3:53:44] Sunnytinker: yeah janna is like the 2nd best counter to mokua
[3:53:46] Sunnytinker: mokia
[3:53:55] FiveFM: Jana is supposed to be one of, if not the best peel champ in the game.
[3:53:58] KatV9: janna has better disengage to protect vayne after 6 but mao shouldve had control of the wave and zoned them
[3:54:07] LyonAoi06: Try poke them first because mao is super behind
[3:54:10] MAQSMI: what boots do janna have?
[3:54:10] KatV9: before lvl 3
[3:54:30] xLippyy: Just DaD mostly, all finished my palworld addiction
[3:54:42] KatV9: rip :(
[3:55:32] magnifaction: he should of waited for jungle
[3:55:33] xLippyy: trying to convince Mr Analyze to take the rest of the day off and game with me. think I've got a 50/50 shot
[3:56:03] Bogdicool: Maokai into Janna is pretty rough, he really doesnt have many options, hes quite immobile
[3:56:20] xLippyy: haha well we talked on the phone earlier and he said he'll think about it :P
[3:56:20] jimbob_ywert: Ezreal scales well so it’s fine
[3:57:16] iMadCuzBad: Without kind ult its a nogo D:
[3:57:17] jimbob_ywert: this Janna played well
[3:57:20] DragoonRed: does ez scale better than a vayne?
[3:57:32] Bogdicool: @DragoonRed doubt
[3:57:33] FiveFM: Enemy Jana in good hands is proper barf material.
[3:57:48] Fully_quantum: if it makes you feel better i just had 2 jgs not bring smite and just stayed mid
[3:57:51] NellyBel: Vayne is like the top 1 ADC atm xD
[3:58:14] jimbob_ywert: @dragoonred He scales generally super well, a fed vayne can be hard to get even with but they have good cc to shut her down
[3:58:21] FiveFM: kaypFreya  Look at the bright side! kaypFreya
[3:58:29] KatV9: yeah shes #1 unironically right now
[3:59:21] jimbob_ywert: Vayne is shit until late game, but a good support can help her get ahead
[3:59:32] Sunnytinker: a Vayne Main player joined the balancing team Kappa
[3:59:38] LMAOKAI88: no
[3:59:42] NellyBel: she can be bullied early game but maokai didnt do that
[4:00:05] NellyBel: as soon as she gets an advantage is real hard to come back lol
[4:00:12] jimbob_ywert: Tbf vayne is balanced
[4:00:21] jimbob_ywert: she’s easily punished early game and takes long time to scale
[4:00:56] ragtimediddly: hallooooo
[4:01:18] ragtimediddly: how goes the struggle
[4:02:03] DragoonRed: if you need mobility def level e second
[4:02:11] Sunnytinker: you max e next
[4:02:46] DelleniumHD: DelleniumHD subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months!

[4:06:03] FiveFM: “I expect all my auto-fills to be Faker”… Lissandra, probably. FailFish
[4:06:15] priam0: I think you should learn jung as 2nd role. Its also a good role for carrying
[4:06:16] rebelaspect: @FiveFM truth
[4:06:22] DragoonRed: @FiveFM imagine thinking your auto fill player is faker, and not giving him the role he wants :D
[4:06:27] Darkcyter: ty for the streeaamm kaypHYPERS
[4:06:53] jimbob_ywert: GG
