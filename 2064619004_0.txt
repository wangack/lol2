[1:54:53] Nightbot: because
[1:55:12] Nanorox: chshLUL Nightbot got me on that one
[1:55:40] Damiusx: @Skyz_Ninjaz ty, but the audio is so unbearable on my speakers, i can hardly hear chase, while Pinkward is blasting me -_-
[1:55:59] TheBearness: what a dumb fucking question
[1:56:22] Skyz_Ninjaz: @Damiusx incase you didnt hear, chase did actually answer your question. He said he pretty much always does 3 point W

[1:57:02] Nanorox: dude I wasn't talking about you. I mean that shit like people. apparently you included. Get insulted so often that when people say something that can be taken some type of way they do. Like my lux last game told me I was playing well and I got mad but she meant in genuinly
[1:57:15] Skyz_Ninjaz: But the just of that video is that there are no AP items that are super good on Shaco right now

[2:00:23] Nightbot: because
[2:00:57] Nanorox: @Skyz_Ninjaz no sky. people so used to sad angry words that when people are nice they still think people are mad at them.

[2:16:27] Nanorox: @bearded_wolf_ malicious compliance at it's finest
[2:16:32] Skyz_Ninjaz: obviously people think about the obvious going to war which is more than enough to be thankful for but on top of that the shit behind closed doors is even more

[2:22:29] Nanorox: Dude you doubled down on who you were and you got twins out of it. lol
[2:22:59] bearded_wolf_: twins are VERY hard without help though. I wouldnt wish that misery on my worst enemy
[2:23:13] Nanorox: Worth?

[2:50:49] luscidous: Bless you lil bro
[2:50:51] batukhan87: skill
[2:51:05] Nanorox: idk about Riven but I think learning trundle is straight trolling from how op it is
[2:51:26] bearded_wolf_: riven is 100% op if you know how to play her
[2:51:50] bearded_wolf_: fiddle is much skill
[2:51:56] NofapGymColdShowers: @bearded_wolf_ facts, sundered sky is crazy on her
[2:52:20] HeroicCheese: @bearded_wolf_ literally whole clip is fiddle pressing R, its wild that it even goes to synapse
[2:52:22] bearded_wolf_: and to be good with riven you only need like 100 games on her
[2:52:38] Nanorox: I believe you, but I am enjoying playing jg right now. It's more entertaining than laning. Like I can have shot calls. I like the appeal of the more cerebral aspect of it
[2:52:40] bearded_wolf_: @HeroicCheese pretty sure people pay them to feature
[2:53:24] bearded_wolf_: @Nanorox I had to quit jungle cause Im pisslow and people dont ever help jungle but will be the first to flame jungle when they lose thier lane with or without ganks. Even when Im opposite side of the map
[2:53:34] bearded_wolf_: I was malding
[2:53:42] HeroicCheese: i just mute all the second the game starts now
[2:53:50] bearded_wolf_: now I just play support/top and focus on my mechanics
[2:53:52] HeroicCheese: because nothing useful will ever get said
[2:53:58] bearded_wolf_: I do the same
