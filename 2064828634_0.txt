[2:16:25] devanpy: Wait u lost like 300 lp Aware
[2:16:38] moosE3knucklE: nah. its just a way to make the game not easy. dumb things u need to keep ur colonist's happy because if that wasnt in the game it would be kinda easy.
[2:16:43] Druss__: Getting high/drunk and playing ARAM is the only way to play League and preserve mental health.
[2:16:51] Redfactor3: @devanpy the paint diagram incident...
[2:16:58] Generalcoss: same here, didn't play seriously for years. leveled up my acc on KR server. plat 2 in flex, gold something in solo duo. I feel like a fish out of water each game KEKW

[2:58:14] moosE3knucklE: @shortseller77 yeah. but if u are dominating an killing ur oppenent and they are 0-8 ur making no money off killing them. so u gotta find opportunites to go to other lanes and impact. just getting ur laners prio helps.

[6:05:26] honeymustard91: @shaefferzz because there are champs which do more than others in pro play environment
[6:05:43] TheEmsleyan: @shaefferzz a lot of pros are happy to handshake meta picks for comfort tbh
[6:05:46] TheForumSpecter: @Redfactor3 It does take the sting out of losing points for sure
[6:05:56] SonstarNA: Pobelter do you ever get nervous playing league nowadays
[6:05:57] hopefulzero: pro play revolves around meta tbh

[6:07:03] Praetor_GG: @shaefferzz besides what others said, in solo q the relative gap between player skill is far greater than champ power
[6:07:19] honeymustard91: that buffer looks so weird
[6:07:34] SonstarNA: Just when you think you can escape intro to stats, you got a mf named Z Score in your game
