[0:47:17] n1ghtl1ght22: lol kayn
[0:47:21] Dx7777: @shinsora_  i mean she has 3 qs which should mean a bit longer fights, a low cd shield and her ult buff lasts like 25 seconds. give her some armor pen and reduce base dmg and she could be fine
[0:47:23] pidgeon35: @9_toes_man its bad idea but you can

[0:49:00] WhyYouHaydn: 3 people on Mid, bard prob coming for you
[0:49:01] the0wl42: Do people who proxy have parents? @Naayil
[0:49:08] shinsora_: @dx7777 like i said the Principe of her Q is the problem why it wouldnt work. she already doesnt deal that much damage with solo qs compared to mid game so she is an assasine who has to go all in so making her weaker and more sustain is not working with the principe of her abilities
[0:49:21] WhyYouHaydn: Oh no, 1 shutdown for her
[0:49:25] Komlin111: I killed their top 2 times and he walked from top all the way to bot and got 4 kills

[1:11:44] KINGBERSERKER7: @Komlin111 its not a good item on olaf
[1:11:51] pan_con_chicharr0n: you can not compare the healing you get with sundered vs the damage you get with profane, 1st is so much better
[1:11:58] GreatSwordTW: how about black cleaver

[1:12:16] Mansterninja: i like going eclipse - profane - sundered sky in some matchups

[3:18:13] w0xell_: @w0xell_  true, but the "everything is meaningless" can be interpreted differently, some are like "nothing matters life is meaningless so just ky$ (in game ofc)", others are like life is meaningless so let's just do whatever the fuck we want because whatever we do it's not really meaningfull so might as well just have fun

[3:21:11] cheerios20203: @w0xell_ The first type of people are just sad and mad. The second type most of them aren't able to do what's fun alll the time because the logic behind is dumb. If you want to live in a society most of the time you have to produce something as you can't consume all the time without any production. If working isn't fun for me and i don't have any kind of money from my parents or something then what am i going to do for example? What's fun isn't going to be possible without any kind of income.

[3:48:41] Exyrisae: garen lategame is very annoying but not op because of how fast and tanky he is

[3:50:00] Komlin111: HyperCheese
[3:50:04] cheerios20203: @draco_silence Yeah he's a very fun champion. If you aren't playing to climb then he's terrific ımo. If you want to climb fast though and care more about climbing then playing a specific champ then champs that have good split push are way better like garen-jax-tryndamere etc. imo
[3:50:16] sadge_peepo: yo what do you think is better lethality aatrox or sustain?
[3:50:28] sadge_peepo: i think sustain

[3:51:20] Instinctxyz: @cornrake i believe
[3:51:22] stewartlittle886: SCHIZO
[3:51:32] Komlin111: what if you can only ff if your down 4-6k gold
[3:51:36] cheerios20203: @draco_silence because aatrox's entire playstyle is around team fighting and if your bot and mid giga feeds then you have significantly lower chance to win the game then with split push champions. Also champs like garen and tryndamere have way less mechanics compared to aatrox since they aren't skill shot reliant
[3:51:42] 1shaggy2000: bro became kratos for 10 secends
[3:51:54] lynxneo76: story of my life in top lane, and i lose mental too much easy and stop focusing in the next games
[3:51:57] cheerios20203: @draco_silence It's not as straight forward as that bro
[3:52:02] cornrake: aatrox has little solo carry potential, especially without lethality build
[3:52:03] zhuge_meng: @zhuge_meng eheehehehe
[3:52:06] 777raw777: How bad is the akshan matchup
[3:52:13] hasan7v7: it should show which piece of sh voted ff

[3:52:41] draco_silence: @cheerios20203 True, but im just trying to improve win or lose

[5:09:15] aphhi: the chinese dont give a single fuck what you do with jenny on the weekends

[5:10:15] Caan88: its really good with detecting them
[5:10:25] nF3ct: Opinions on LT nerf?
[5:10:28] sam_cookis: its not that much in high rank it was but they change smth in vanguard

[5:10:55] Grymmerald: It does run 24 7 but it works only when a Riot game is open
[5:10:55] jakeydesu1: if you close it you have to restart your pc next time you want to play riot's games
[5:11:02] swisslion2806: sure but there are not many people who will do it on constant bases
[5:11:03] sh0wmakerrr: @naayil how many games to chal bro ?
[5:11:17] swisslion2806: uninstall it whenever you dont play league xd
[5:11:18] brab1ssimo: Ahhh that makes sense
[5:11:20] Caan88: riot employe jumps trhough the window and turns it back on @Naayil
[5:11:22] GwendolynDwysil: yes but then you have to restart pc just to start the game aian
[5:11:23] Flamethrower270: people get scared cus vanguard has kernel access to your PC but i doubt it does much with those permissions

[5:12:08] Flamethrower270: first time with vanguard after installing you restart PC
[5:12:09] Pokeths: you have to restart
[5:12:12] Flamethrower270: after that you dont have to

[5:12:14] owo11111111: no u have to reset pc
[5:12:15] the0wl42: nah, you can only close it manually but not open it
[5:12:20] swisslion2806: you restart it only once after you install the vanguard

[5:12:35] Pokeths: it makes you restart
[5:12:36] kijitaki: youu have to buy a new pc to activate vanguard
[5:12:36] GwendolynDwysil: valorant works the same
[5:12:39] nF3ct: No, Vanguard basically says "I want to run as early as possible to detect anything that might get started after me"
[5:12:39] MisterVladimir: no it starts with your pc
[5:12:42] swisslion2806: it is a separate software
[5:12:44] GwendolynDwysil: no
[5:12:44] owo11111111: if I close vanguard I have to restart pc if i have to play valorant
[5:12:45] toplanemetaforsure: u can close canguard
[5:12:45] swisslion2806: no
[5:12:46] Flamethrower270: i just shat my pants bro
[5:12:49] TokzEUW: no it's part of your pc
[5:12:50] GwendolynDwysil: it's a separate program
[5:12:51] swisslion2806: its running in your kernel
[5:12:51] bohomaz_design: jeeez, people need to stop this bs vanguard discussion. Literally every esports game has a vaguard-like kernel based anticheat. If you play CS Valve has all ur nudes anyway. Why does it matter if Riot gets them too? :P
[5:12:52] owo11111111: no it;s not part of the client
[5:12:53] Grymmerald: Of course it's possible, it's Riot
[5:12:55] toplanemetaforsure: but it wont restart wthout restarting pc
[5:12:56] deviileyez: Why so many people gets blue screen when they want to sign in valorant?
[5:12:57] Grymmerald: They suck at coding
[5:12:58] Kyashan: nope, its something that goes up when you start your pc, if you close it you have to restart your pc @Naayil
[5:13:00] Caan88: it becomes a part of your whole pc system doesnt it
[5:13:05] kuro_muda: it's a kernel program so you have to restart your computer
[5:13:06] kijitaki: vanguard is seperate from the client
[5:13:10] owo11111111: its like part of ur pc like if u star pc
[5:13:11] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[5:13:15] GwendolynDwysil: vanguard starts before windows doesnt it? tahts why you have to restart
[5:13:17] toplanemetaforsure: it runs at the kernel level, its always running, and starts before the os does
[5:13:18] TokzEUW: that's how normal anti-cheat works, but not kernel @Naayil
[5:13:18] kuro_muda: it's a separate entity from the game
[5:13:20] Caan88: it become part of the software, if you get banned, your hardware gets banned to i think
[5:13:25] Forex928: It's in the kernel, so it basically is part of your pc
[5:13:26] hamddoo: no bro the get access to hardware ID
[5:13:29] kachisha: it's part of your OS
[5:13:31] TokzEUW: @Naayil yea but that's not kernel
[5:13:36] Pokeths: this goes deeper than that
[5:13:36] owo11111111: it's like vac ban but worse
[5:13:37] Caan88: it become part of the software, if you get banned, your hardware gets banned to i think , if that makes sense @Naayil
[5:13:43] MakisDso_: Yeah but vac is less secure
[5:13:50] kuro_muda: doesn't work with vanguard since it operates directly from your os
[5:13:51] hamddoo: yea
[5:13:52] swisslion2806: ITS IN THE KERNEL, kernel is a thing in your pc that makes communication between memory processor and software possible its like a bridge for hardware and software
[5:13:54] GwendolynDwysil: mac addresses can be spoofed
[5:14:02] owo11111111: bro xi ping china be like skibidi toilet
[5:14:02] toplanemetaforsure: yes tjey ca do anything
[5:14:03] Caan88: they will find the aatrox folder @Naayil
[5:14:04] deviileyez: And you can change the motherboard and you solve the problem
[5:14:07] hamddoo: and you get banned need new pc xD
[5:14:07] toplanemetaforsure: they just saz they dont

[5:14:34] Saxoboyy: For sure
[5:14:34] Caan88: 100 mill robux
[5:14:36] owo11111111: bruh literally they dont care
[5:14:43] owo11111111: they sell that information
[5:14:49] nF3ct: Nah, that would be Riot Games suicide
[5:14:50] swisslion2806: well they are owned by tencent so riot cant do anything if tencent wants it from thme
[5:14:51] swisslion2806: TS IN THE KERNEL, kernel is a thing in your pc that makes communication between memory processor and software possible its like a bridge for hardware and software
[5:14:55] owo11111111: they make like tons of money of that shit
[5:14:55] MisterVladimir: thats what a hackerprogramm does it takes access to your whole pc
[5:14:57] TokzEUW: I'll up the bet and make it even more direct, that riot is selling it to the CCP
[5:14:58] the0wl42: and yet we will keep playing in league
[5:15:16] Pokeths: Im an addict :(
[5:15:17] kijitaki: i dont think they would do that, they would kill their billion dollar game
[5:15:20] Forex928: God knows what tencent might do with our info xd
[5:15:24] swisslion2806: i want league to be my job thats my excuse
[5:15:25] icakiee: children = spear
[5:15:27] toplanemetaforsure: the risky part is even if u trust riot(lol) vanguard could be insecure and get hacked and then some random can do anything
[5:15:31] BetterBird1: How many children?
[5:15:32] icakiee: we get it
[5:15:33] the0wl42: bro has to feed nayil aatrox jr
[5:15:36] toplanemetaforsure: happened with honkai impact
[5:15:38] ItsDjMigz: do you really have kids?
[5:15:41] owo11111111: no, they literally can make tons of money of ur league opinions as long as they need it and stuff
[5:15:45] GwendolynDwysil: classic top lane experience
[5:15:49] Caan88: isnt it scary that a company  gets complet full access to your personal pc with aatrox sus folders @Naayil
[5:15:51] Pokeths: spears his son
[5:15:51] the0wl42: Would you name your child aatrox?
[5:15:53] 27Worst: jus tbigned ur tiktoks now i'm hear , rarely type
[5:15:57] rratirl: he has bro
[5:15:58] bonetakers: camille tips?
[5:16:00] 27Worst: hi naayil il ove ICE CREAM
[5:16:03] icakiee: he has 1 kid named issa
[5:16:03] kijitaki: whats your favorite aatrox skin naayil
[5:16:07] owo11111111: top experience be like be ganked then perish
[5:16:11] default_b0t: if he had kids he wouldnt being playing league
[5:16:13] MrFaby69: is gwen matchup aatrox favored?
[5:16:14] yavuzsultan_selim: yes he has 3
[5:16:15] BetterBird1: i found naayil off of youtube shorts

[5:16:22] ItsDjMigz: Kappa
[5:16:26] BetterBird1: the dont pick rumble video is what really got me in
[5:16:30] swisslion2806: @Forex928 nothing they can sell it to other companies basically that might need it and thats it unless they actually install spyware that can control web cams and microphones keyboard strokes and mouse movement
[5:16:36] GwendolynDwysil: ctrl 5 for the wings ??
[5:16:51] yashiken20: you best streamer bro i love you
[5:16:58] baatush_: @Naayil  that red jacket behind u looks sick can u show it?
[5:17:05] 27Worst: i kinda wanna try top lane/aatrox i'm emerald 2 adc main but u make aatrox look fun
[5:17:08] bonetakers: any tips for camille?
[5:17:13] owo11111111: bru they literally pay millions for people that do opinions on facebook
[5:17:20] swisslion2806: ghost too
[5:17:21] owo11111111: league opinions be like poggers
[5:17:28] swisslion2806: @Forex928 but thats way too hypothetical
[5:17:29] bohomaz_design: Also whats cringe is that people cry about Vanguard, but everyone has a highly vulnerable mobile phone in their pocket with way more important data to mine and sell
[5:17:31] Forex928: @swisslion2806 yeah I mean tencent have had legit data leaks before and now with this it might be on a bigger scale and even worse impact if another data leak does occurr
[5:17:42] Exyrisae: to counter vanguard data harvesting just fill your computer with 10tb of trans furry porn to clog their system
[5:17:48] swisslion2806: well the thing is
[5:17:51] swisslion2806: if that happens
[5:17:59] swisslion2806: league will be  banned in most countries
[5:18:00] swisslion2806: in eu and us
