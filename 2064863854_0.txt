[2:25:15] Channel_42: K'Sante exists, and you're complaining about LaBlanc.
[2:25:15] sema3a: does her abilities do damage to you or is just her auto atacks
[2:25:17] Highlander84: I keep saying the simple fix to AD leblanc. make it so she has negative AD ratios. all her abilities do 100% negative bonus ad
[2:25:17] sp_grimmlin: i don't see why they don't just remove her ad scaling completely
[2:25:20] ztnaj: is this the same logic Nickk uses when someone builds anti tank items and he's not a tank, so they shouldn't hurt him BerryLogical
[2:25:24] nickophant: @ms_teemo right i forgor

[2:25:34] Kurumi780: Jax has more AP scalings than AD
[2:25:37] Ms_Teemo: it's extremely efficient to go zhonya on him
[2:25:38] Bankai900: Lb can be what she wants don't be adiist
[2:25:43] popper729: jax is just a menace
[2:25:45] KingTurtleMan: yup jax has primarily ap scaling
[2:25:47] hogleey: gesterr you here still?
[2:25:48] Ms_Teemo: his w e r all have ap scaling
[2:25:49] dominicoap: his ult passive and w
[2:25:53] Wolflordxyz: for the most part its only ap scaling on abilities
[2:25:54] Highlander84: jax used to be able to build gunblade back in the day
[2:25:55] TheGesterr: almost every Jax ability has hybrid scaling
[2:25:55] arxhangxll: as if half the ad items in the game don’t give magic damage cause that’s necessary
[2:25:56] RiotEnemy: Are you trying to say that lb is Scrumptious
[2:26:07] xTomtenTV: Isnt his ult literally the more ad/ap you build the more armor/mr you get?

[2:26:16] hogleey: @Channel_42 :c
[2:26:28] Kurumi780: He has more AP scalings but his abilities synergize with auto attacks
[2:26:30] KingTurtleMan: i think he's intended to be able to go either way. like Kat
[2:26:31] YesThisIsCoop: riot can't balance, water wet sky blue

[2:26:47] DarthAchilles: But who? @Quantum
[2:26:47] KingTurtleMan: AD Leblanc seems so janky on paper
[2:26:48] nyckogat: just remove her from the game

[2:27:06] big_daddi_p: bro thats what i'm saying about maokai in aram bro. he's -20% damage which feels awful to even play tank
[2:27:09] Ms_Teemo: @Sakurarain_x she abuses the energized items
[2:27:09] DarthAchilles: But who asked GANDONIO
[2:27:10] hogleey: @hogleey TRUE BESTIE
[2:27:11] Highlander84: @terranda_wisperwind what about giving her negative AD ratios?
[2:27:15] Fafy15: Just remove Shiv YesYes
[2:27:17] Eriadar: I think the problem is that she energizes too quicky with her dashes, which is stupid
[2:27:18] dazam_13: @terranda_wisperwind i see you O.o
[2:27:20] xTomtenTV: Just remove LB only one that will be sad is bobquin Kappa

[2:27:32] big_daddi_p: Ew
[2:27:36] Sakurarain_x: @Sakurarain_x oh ok Learning
[2:27:41] hogleey: Pout
[2:27:46] mellowmew: i miss ad raka ):

[2:27:53] amhappie: i hate it
[2:27:54] big_daddi_p: walkin
[2:27:56] TheGesterr: @TheGesterr I'm not, I don't even know what tsundere is outside of some waifu weeb personality trope, I do know yandere is like, murderous obsessive love trope
[2:28:03] amhappie: LB chain should be melee range only
[2:28:06] amhappie: >:(
[2:28:10] hogleey: @TheGesterr thats lauren or jenn
[2:28:13] roophiesdd: why is ad lb still a thing
[2:28:16] TheGesterr: but that's about the extent of my knowledge on that bit
[2:28:17] hogleey: actually just lorn
[2:28:23] Fafy15: Afraid
[2:28:24] TheGesterr: yea Lorn is 100% yandere keking

[2:28:32] nyckogat: funny that their way to fix lb ad was buffing her ap
[2:28:35] Wolflordxyz: @terranda_wisperwind catAsk I have a question about League design if you would be willing to answer
[2:28:36] Dyslesic: Here is a thought, remove lb auto attacks
[2:28:37] Kurumi780: @terranda_wisperwind Since u guys are making Runnans melee too, will it work on Gangplank Q?
[2:28:49] drigers5: if W disabled her auto attack, that would work
[2:28:55] TheGesterr: I'd be ok with removing Statick Shiv
[2:29:02] Sakurarain_x: shiv should have never came back
[2:29:04] Stryd3rrrrr: @Kurumi780 no satan
[2:29:05] Gorkmuk: Hello
[2:29:05] Kbotking: would you rather go against a zoe or AD leblanc?
[2:29:07] hogleey: But statik is fun Pout
[2:29:13] zwn7: remove her autos ok
[2:29:20] Eriadar: if jumps didnt energize her items and rune it would be ok imo @Quantum
[2:29:27] kenny_172: adcs dont even buy shiv anymore
[2:29:30] ANK0U1: can you play it next to show us how its done?
[2:29:34] hogleey: BASED
[2:29:34] drigers5: just have W disable her auto, she'll be off AD 100%
[2:29:37] xTomtenTV: I dont think thats true tbh. If they remove shiv shell just buy the rest of the energize items and still do this
[2:29:41] mauri1: just set her Ad to 3 ok
[2:29:45] fusionnaveen1337: Can't have AD Leblanc without LeBlanc. Just remove LeBlanc keking

[2:29:59] nyckogat: @xTomtenTV wave clear is a huge factor
[2:29:59] roophiesdd: maybe so you cant buy more then one energies item?
[2:30:04] terranda_wisperwind: I never said that
[2:30:10] hogleey: BROS LYING
[2:30:17] Kurumi780: Yelough said that not terranda
[2:30:18] danny_boi95: AD leblanc players in lower ELO's fumble too much stuff
[2:30:20] hogleey: Nicks telling fibs

[2:30:55] nyckogat: its funny because lb aa is so terrible
[2:30:56] Sakurarain_x: we could just bribe bobqin to tell everyone ad leblanc is bad and pay him to stop playing it and it'll disappear. Profit
