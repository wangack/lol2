[3:33:37] popper729: I thought Viper was a league player, not a mechanic
[3:33:38] OhTenGeneral: There's no source of sustained damage
[3:33:40] freshkidsucks: doran making aatrox look balanced

[3:34:14] deusmacarena: just PLEASE HLE stop with the lucian
[3:34:19] shag65: Bro its was like nothing was happening and then the game just ended lmao
[3:34:30] deusmacarena: @shag65 welcome to top LCK teams
[3:34:34] dystroyka: GenG is just the better team tbh
[3:34:48] TotalIyNotATaco: not many people look happy in the league scene
[3:34:52] TotalIyNotATaco: apart from the casters
[3:34:54] shag65: Lmao
[3:34:56] RiotEnemy: I think they're trying smolder top
[3:34:57] buuutty: idk seems like HLE lost in draft

[3:35:11] Couwcouw: KEKW
[3:35:17] deusmacarena: @dystroyka i dunno HLE draft was absolutely garbage.  gave away senna/tk to pick the most useless champ in botlane

[3:35:34] dystroyka: @dystroyka I think GenG just has solo lane gap tbh
[3:35:35] Ccapehart123: @lourlo do you have any formatting ideas to make the drafts less cookie cutter in pro play? pocket picks and the supreme mastery of individual champions I felt was the golden age of league pro play
[3:35:39] soupshark: he didnt go bok what did he expef
[3:35:47] amhappie: rumble keking
[3:35:51] TotalIyNotATaco: @ccapehart123 poppy top xDDDD
[3:36:01] OhTenGeneral: This game makes me wonder how both teams were 5-1 going into this
[3:36:24] dystroyka: HLE beats weaker teams by just outskilling them. their macro isn't that good
[3:36:37] swaywanNA: fearless draft is the move for sure
[3:36:40] Noftie: blind pick GIGACHAD
[3:36:40] OhTenGeneral: Is the LCK pretty top-heavy?

[3:37:02] Cariyla: @popper729 champs can only be picked once in a series
[3:37:09] Noftie: that would be a fun event with rerolls
[3:37:18] Ccapehart123: popper suggested 20 band
[3:37:19] Cariyla: (per team I think)
[3:37:20] Camags: ultimate bravery in pro play
[3:37:22] Ccapehart123: bans*
