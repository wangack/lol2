[4:58:41] Guardian_TK: CDs from my experience don't yield much return for the most part. They claim it protects your investments from "inflation" but in the end the amount you get back from interest doesn't get adjusted for inflation. You just invest in it with the knowledge of knowing how much you'll get back after it matures.
[4:59:09] Guardian_TK: It's designed to protect your assets from deflation on that note, but inflation's the only thing that'll ever happen
