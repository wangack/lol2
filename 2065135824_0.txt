[3:05:49] criticwhospeaksfacts: @jannablowsu nothing wrong, it's perspective but generally the older you get the +/- range becomes more greater and it's more accepted. It just becomes an issue around 18-21 age. But bottom line if you're above the legal age and you have some maturity and know what you're doing all good
[3:05:50] Lazynameross: no right?

[5:39:06] kebimbimbab: oh love scenario
[5:39:09] kebimbimbab: love this song
[5:39:22] GlacialEmbrace: sivir is rough because she has 2 dmg abilities. 2 others are purely utility. ult being a steroid feels bad lol

[5:41:54] jannablowsu: pyke is my ban this patch owo
[5:42:06] Senyuno: Sivir is almost a pure stat stick which is hard to balance
[5:42:16] Mak2mz: pd gives great value on her w damage
[5:43:12] blewbeary: you cant go ie w/ navori
[5:43:14] Deielrion: cant go IE with navori

[5:45:59] Deielrion: you can't build both serylda and black cleaver Janna
[5:46:02] Cariyla: @Lazynameross Sivir W is actually a super broken spell it doesn't even count as an AA it deals a special type of damage that basically can't proc any item effects

[7:07:12] Cariyla: haha
[7:07:20] Cariyla: BirdgeLeave
[7:07:21] morgblankreal: do u think its possible to one trick morg till high master or gm
[7:07:28] Lazynameross: hes been lethality for a while now
[7:07:50] Cariyla: As long as you're good nodd
[7:08:03] morgblankreal: why does one tricking usually lead to climbing higher?
[7:08:07] Lazynameross: i thought changes were gonna make actual bruiser building worth it but i guess not
[7:08:17] Cariyla: But Morg is for some reason banned a lot in lower elo
[7:08:19] Cariyla: Even when she's bad
[7:08:20] Cariyla: eeeh
[7:08:31] LaowaiUK: Anything‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for my W max khazix support arc
[7:08:42] zionthegod: there is a skarner top main and a Taric jungle main. so morg should do fine
[7:08:43] voidmoons: ouch
[7:08:46] voidmoons: that maiden
[7:09:01] ThomasTheTwink: RUN HARDER
[7:09:07] CrazeyeOuO: @Cariyla can't trust teammates to not get rooted by every bind, that's why i ban lux every time XD if someone else bans lux I ban morg instead
[7:09:16] morgblankreal: ziom really?
[7:09:25] morgblankreal: zion
[7:09:33] ThomasTheTwink: i know lightrocket is the taric jungle
[7:09:41] zionthegod: @morgblankreal yeah.
[7:09:46] Cariyla: Merthos is the Skarner
[7:09:47] Cariyla: YEP
[7:09:57] revrsedcodex: @morgblankreal not a very blindable sup and has hard counters so it would def be harder/take more time
[7:10:06] voidmoons: merthos Classic

[7:10:51] zionthegod: no problem
[7:11:07] Cariyla: @morgblankreal Most enchanters/mage supports are actually very good into Morg cause they can proc the shield very easily
[7:11:15] ems__c: redemption VALUE
[7:11:17] revrsedcodex: @morgblankreal like her e in lane is great but in teamfights with 5 teams players that can have stuns it can be not as reliable
[7:11:20] Cariyla: Like zyra can easily take down spellshield with a Q and then hit the root
[7:11:21] Cariyla: eeeh
[7:11:38] Cariyla: She counters most engage supports tho eeeh
[7:11:46] Kaisa_Kardashian: plus morg is just a shit pick in general sadly
[7:12:02] revrsedcodex: engage sups in lane, yes, outside usually they are fine
[7:12:12] Cariyla: yeahhh
[7:12:20] ReplayKay: ooo nice hook
[7:12:21] Lazynameross: BIG
[7:12:23] voidmoons: SHEEEEEEESH

[7:13:03] Cariyla: YEP
[7:13:36] voidmoons: WE NEED AQUA!

[7:14:04] Kaisa_Kardashian: does that count
[7:14:07] Cariyla: no
[7:14:12] Cariyla: more water madgeNOW
[7:14:20] zionthegod: buff thresh so multiple people can take the lantern at once
[7:14:20] Kaisa_Kardashian: ok mb chiefg
[7:14:22] Lazynameross: omg he lived wha
[7:14:39] Cariyla: Water good Gladge

[7:16:29] Cariyla: Sadge
[7:16:33] voidmoons: sheeesh
[7:16:34] voidmoons: the birb
[7:16:34] LaowaiUK: I honestly don‚Äôt think thresh is in need of buffs tbh. People take wrong runes on him often and builds.
[7:16:43] avuloseunda: @kaisa_kardashian i think I'll be bit more late I'm sorry :(
[7:16:46] LaowaiUK: Small buffs are fine but it‚Äôs not super needed
[7:17:08] Lazynameross: isnt thresh supposed to be one of the mechanical sups
[7:17:15] Lazynameross: plus he does a lot
[7:17:16] Sanecore: buff enchanter dmg then they can buff engage supports
[7:17:22] Lazynameross: 48 isnt crazy tbh
[7:17:27] Cariyla: buffing his base armor stuntNoted
[7:17:30] revrsedcodex: I don't know the last time I saw a thresh tbh
