[1:20:19] sharashino__: hope he agrees if we prepare good enough pitch
[1:20:22] CaketownHero: I feel like roguelikes have a lot of freedom in builds because if you get OP it's not a big deal. Run resets anyways. Leads to a lot of fun prospects
[1:20:50] nisoteric34: @sharashino just suck him off if he's not convinced YEP
[1:20:58] LULuser: theyre less fun once i get the OP build

[1:33:07] dancewiththedeathh: cowSure
[1:33:11] CaketownHero: my best friend is half korean, his parents met when his dad was stationed there. As far as I know most korean parents are NOT happy with having their children marry into western culture.
[1:33:15] saintopiaa: mexican wives are the best
[1:33:33] sharashino__: Koreans are not easygoing?
[1:34:02] ZeptionT: generally I heard theyre easier going than japanese
[1:34:35] ZeptionT: you doctor yet?

[1:36:36] diramude: @Skaglicker KEKW
[1:36:40] raalenn: League Hagwon
[1:36:44] CaketownHero: Koreans are required to do 2 years of military service out of primary school, so they enter the job market afterwards at around 20 in our standard age
[1:36:47] diramude: America is being more like that with these fricken housing prices
[1:36:48] blzzzzzrd: What exactly is Oppah Gangham Style?

[1:37:18] nisoteric34: YEP COCK
[1:37:21] sharashino__: in Poland there’s a big pressure on moving out from your family home as soon as it is possible, living with parents after high school is treated like a failure
[1:37:23] diramude: COCKA
[1:37:28] nisoteric34: COCK
[1:37:40] LULuser: thats sexist
[1:37:44] circusdiana: have you tried bel veth?

[1:38:18] dancewiththedeathh: @gvsson easy money
[1:38:28] gvsson: sorry, OBLIGATORY service
[1:38:32] Flafski: @LULuser In the US you alone make that choice though
[1:38:40] sharashino__: at least they are paying you when you serve?
[1:38:42] ZeptionT: sharashino__ it must be like that bcs you can afford renting a house working a minimal wage job with ease
[1:38:59] diramude: idk I think it builds character
[1:39:05] nisoteric34: Gayge
[1:39:12] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT You realize that their minimal wage is also low sinc rent and everything else is cheap? LuL
[1:39:18] LULuser: can you join and tell us
[1:39:21] OaknLane: it does give a base line level of experience that probably is for the better later on
[1:39:29] OaknLane: over all i mean
[1:39:37] sharashino__: @zeptiont it’s the opposite rent prices skyrocketed and you can barely make it renting one room apartment just for yourself
[1:40:04] Leithal_Dosage: Selective service
[1:40:06] ZeptionT: oh how does that work then
[1:40:10] LULuser: that was a thing??
[1:40:15] ZeptionT: do people live together with foreigners
[1:40:19] ZeptionT: renting the same house
[1:40:20] diramude: my cousin served in the swiss army because he was required, which I know a little different but really all that happened is he got real fit
[1:40:26] diramude: and learned first aid skills
[1:40:32] nisoteric34: if the government goes to war NOOOO sudden ads jumpscare NOOO

[1:40:49] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT How does it work? Same as it works everywhere else=
[1:41:04] sharashino__: people rent rooms and live together or they stay with their parents @zeptiont it’s hard to live off off minimal wage just by yourself even though it is high
[1:41:04] nisoteric34: i didnt have ads for 1 hour on twitch, what did you cowsep? cowSad
[1:41:17] LULuser: damn
[1:41:20] andrewwryan: @gvsson yeah but the infantry uses the drones tho
[1:41:22] circusdiana: is that ph server?
[1:41:24] LULuser: i like walking everywhere
[1:41:30] dancewiththedeathh: military makes you grow as a person, a lot
[1:41:36] ZeptionT: JuKKi_ see its not like that everywhere around the world
[1:42:04] gvsson: 200 km in US gets you to your job, 200 km in EU/KR gets you out the country :D
[1:42:18] diramude: well tbf thats california lol
[1:42:19] nisoteric34: KEKL
[1:42:30] ZeptionT: sharashino__ yea house market is expensive everywhere then unless youre okay living with foreigners its tough
[1:42:31] circusdiana: are you playing in PH server?
[1:42:33] Outk4st16: you sign up for the draft. 99% it’s never going to happen. and if you do get drafted you have to make it through the physical eval which about 80% of people will fail for one reason or another.
[1:42:34] sharashino__: homelessness is a huge problem in USA as far as I know

[1:43:36] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT You're gonna have to give me an example since i live in Finland and it is like that here. And the rent is fucking awful if you're living alone
[1:43:37] gvsson: @sharashino__ in EU in Serbia its almost impossible to be homeless, you really have to be a freak to achieve it
[1:43:45] CaketownHero: north korea is "currently" being held back by most of the rest of the world, not a huge issue for south korea
[1:43:58] ddmess: I want to pat your bald head

[1:46:27] nisoteric34: can you turn down the vibrator noises? Disgusting
[1:46:52] LULuser: its $1 to control vibrator for 1 second
[1:46:58] CaketownHero: I mean... are you not?
[1:47:25] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT I'm not even on minimum wage and my rents about 30% of my pre-tax income
[1:47:31] ZeptionT: JuKKi_ and the worse thing is half of the working population is getting minimum wage and having roommates isnt the norm
[1:47:33] nisoteric34: says the poor bitch PogYou KEKL

[2:02:15] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT And that's still the situation - different missus, city and job but my rents 30% of my pre-taxed income. 50%'ish of my after tax income
[2:02:16] CaketownHero: gotta get tracking pee

[2:04:27] ZeptionT: :)
[2:04:34] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT Oh no, they don't get treated like failures here. It's a known issue that everything is fucking expensive and minimum wage means "crappy" standard of living. We got a saying you pay rent and bills then bite your nails for food
[2:04:39] nisoteric34: cowsep is also coming YEP

[2:07:31] ZeptionT: oh ye
[2:08:12] LULuser: omg we made the pee yellow
[2:08:14] OaknLane: that basically means we win
[2:08:16] JuKKi_: @ZeptionT But idk, Finlands supposingly a 1st world country but low income means pretty crappy standard of living here as well. And they're actively trying to make it worse as well by cutting all the things
[2:08:20] neklom: real pee gun
[2:08:23] OaknLane: next you'll need to make yellow snow
[2:08:26] diramude: in America people used to be treated like losers if they couldn't live alone but not as much anymore because times is rough
