[4:24:59] Skever_: true I hate having to go on rule 34 they need to add it to client
[4:24:59] liama_in_a_taco: theyre probably planning on pouring the lore into the league mmo instead of putting it on a webpage
[4:25:04] Xaneth_: league lore is all over the place though, all because of the different skinlines having their own universes, it's hard to get invested into something so ridiculously fragmented
