[1:23:25] shadowsapiens: oh
[1:23:31] persimini: @4amlasagna tbf they added new features to help like potion lady at fort, but still :/
[1:23:42] EU_This_NA_That: viktor one of the doubters
[1:23:48] srepliomerium: the new way of making overloads does be fucking glorious ngl
[1:23:55] Xindrjayzda: I can honestly say that in its current state, I would not recommend RS3 to anyone
[1:23:57] Ice_Cloud: Copege
[1:24:00] ReenoFTW: smolder scales Copege
[1:24:12] EU_This_NA_That: smolder will be useful Copege
[1:24:13] shadowsapiens: zoe being fed is never a problem tbh LUL
[1:24:15] srepliomerium: @Xindrjayzda would disagree, there still is A LOTT of content to do
[1:24:15] Luckydude: adam genuine question: why dont you use your W more? Doesnt it (very slightly) heal you when it damages enemies?
[1:24:20] ReenoFTW: at 40 minutes hes good
[1:24:35] McBurgerKong: @Xindrjayzda Why is that, have not played it in a while
[1:24:53] persimini: hell, jagex gave up on rs3 too. they still have christmas decor up in fort and its nearly march xdd
[1:24:55] shadowsapiens: well if u buy mr since your frontline
[1:25:10] srepliomerium: @persimini this is bait, that's your own deco that can be changed all year around
[1:25:14] ReenoFTW: 5Head ?
[1:25:20] EU_This_NA_That: EU_This_NA_That subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! loving the content mr Nerd Diamondge
[1:25:21] persimini: @srepliomerium WHAT
[1:25:27] persimini: wait for real
[1:25:34] Cythan_: Diamondge today
[1:25:45] Cythan_: the win streak starts NOW Diamondge
[1:25:50] srepliomerium: @persimini yep :P can change them to summer/winter/christmas/etc whenever you want
[1:26:08] persimini: with the tree customization guy?
[1:26:11] srepliomerium: yup
[1:26:12] Xindrjayzda: RS3 has 0 direction right now, barely listens to the players feedback, FOMO promos everywhere, no good content ideas. OSRS however will have you engaged for longer, has a direction, devs care about the platers, introduces content that is actually worthwhile
[1:26:16] persimini: bc i want that christmas shit outta here
[1:26:29] persimini: ffs omg ty for this info, ill check it out today
[1:26:31] Xindrjayzda: The whole of the RS3 fort stuff should have been like 2 months of content
[1:26:41] Xindrjayzda: instead it was stretched over a year
[1:26:42] srepliomerium: fort was kinda bad as storyline ngl
[1:26:50] srepliomerium: and dragon slayer 2 was a letdown for sure
[1:26:53] Cythan_: Bedge
[1:26:55] persimini: yeah
[1:26:57] Cythan_: BIG
[1:27:01] EU_This_NA_That: BIG
[1:27:02] PizelRs: SHEEEESH
[1:27:04] shadowsapiens: was u trolling that x0r6ztGiggle
[1:27:04] GothicLogic: Gj
[1:27:12] count_monky: gj
[1:27:19] Cythan_: being an adc when sick nerd is your jungler Despairge
[1:27:36] Makotoz: @Cythan_ I dodge every game I see a heca in my draft because of this
[1:27:38] PizelRs: sadly smolder and hwei too shit of a comp
[1:27:40] ff1_5: Platinum today king! You got this!
[1:27:41] persimini: when zem and vorkath came out, it felt laggy simply bc of teleporting to the statue just to get in instance
[1:27:41] shadowsapiens: i mean its prob a smolder player that cant play the champ
[1:27:44] shadowsapiens: xdd
[1:27:46] persimini: Too much in 1 place imo
[1:27:50] Cythan_: @Makotoz x0r6ztGiggle
[1:27:51] erzokk: @Xindrjayzda "player feedback" is a slippery slope, it destroyed a lot in osrs
[1:27:52] Blahhhhh: holy shit LEAGUE
[1:27:59] kevenia: Cho Rogan LUL
[1:28:21] srepliomerium: @erzokk would disagree over the player feedback, all they do on combat beta is listen to player feedback
[1:28:26] beyblade_king: emerald really cant lane into yasuo huh
[1:28:27] Xindrjayzda: also if you're a new player, osrs is better than rs3 coz rs3 combat is not intuitive, the UI is awful, the early game experience doesnt actually teach you anything. Its focussed on " spend keys to get to the endgame asap"
[1:28:35] ReenoFTW: riven is the win con
[1:28:39] ReenoFTW: she poppin off
[1:28:40] srepliomerium: if rs3 introduces combat achievements/diaires like oldschool has and the combat beta is good rs3 has very good potential this year
[1:28:45] fry_like_a_pirate: happi
[1:28:48] Makotoz: I'm also not a believer :)
[1:28:53] Cythan_: wawa oo aa wawa oo aa
[1:28:57] shadowsapiens: riven cant be stopped unless they send like 3
[1:28:58] Xindrjayzda: @erzokk Yeah they're listening now because of how badly they fucked up pvm with necro release and have no idea how to fix it by themselves KEKW
[1:29:01] shadowsapiens: should be an easy dub
[1:29:05] Allon_123: real talk u gotta ban smolder. so many ppl cant play that champ in emerald
[1:29:11] Monkeboy11: Is this the plat run?
[1:29:12] poppz: have you ever watched dantes hecarim?

[1:29:29] Makotoz: ‚úÖ bad smites
[1:29:54] ReenoFTW: riven is going for it
[1:29:54] erzokk: @erzokk big doomer mentality, all games don't have to be a constant hamster wheel for player engagement, lots of content to participate in
[1:29:55] ReenoFTW: holy
[1:29:59] alphabraad: help the riven
[1:30:00] sneaky_dane: GIGACHAD riven
[1:30:08] fry_like_a_pirate: maybe she should give a fuck xdd

[1:30:10] notjackie_chan: average riven player right there
[1:30:11] PizelRs: main character
[1:30:24] srepliomerium: @persimini ehh cant link it, but if you google/wiki osrs combat achievements it should give a picture

[1:32:12] srepliomerium: @persimini depends in what kinda bubble you are communitywise iguess
[1:32:19] persimini: necro was suppose to help level out the player base combat interactions and it did, but people who were pvming daily hated it bc prices tanked hard
[1:32:25] Pizzasalad: big
