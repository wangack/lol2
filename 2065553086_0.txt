[0:27:50] pikapika_666_: nice
[0:28:48] Coconattsuu: the adc going off alone to fight the fed jungler with baron very nice
[0:29:51] YourGFisABaron: adc has like 12 kills. was a limit test. + didnt lose a turret
[0:30:04] UberZanc: what rank is this account at? Cuz this game is ouch to watch
[0:32:38] pikapika_666_: sound sometimes gets distorted for 2-3 seconds in every 5 minutes.
[0:35:01] pikapika_666_: jgl should be ad
[0:35:31] pikapika_666_: gg
[0:37:59] pikapika_666_: first time in a ranked... :)
[0:42:31] UberZanc: this is the fall of most ranked matches. players taking up champs they dont play in ranked. I really wish they would lock it out champs you dont have any practice on aka mastery points. Should have x amount of mastery before youre allowed to take it into ranked.
[0:44:32] pikapika_666_: @ipav999 still: "sound sometimes gets distorted for 2-3 seconds in every 5 minutes."
[0:44:49] pikapika_666_: (microphone only)
[0:44:54] YourGFisABaron: @UberZanc  only problem with that is if your champs are commonly picked or get focus banned out
[0:44:57] UberZanc: have you tried reloading pika? im not having sound issues
[0:45:12] UberZanc: @YourGFisABaron thats true

[1:26:40] UberZanc: @kuschelketzchen fully agree
[1:27:02] kuschelketzchen: its german it means cuddle cat
[1:27:26] pikapika_666_: or kitty :)
[1:27:39] kuschelketzchen: Yes kitty the more accurate word
[1:28:01] kuschelketzchen: I wonder, is there official infortmation about ipavs favourite animal?
[1:28:02] Oitetment: ipav german duolingo? pauseCat
[1:28:22] pikapika_666_: his favorite animal is teemo
[1:31:08] kuschelketzchen: is riftmaker still good on teemo?
[1:32:13] pikapika_666_: full damage seems to be good this season.
[1:33:11] pikapika_666_: yeah werent enough shrooms
[1:34:19] kuschelketzchen: I wish i was good at spacing like ipav but im often getting all ined by enemy toplaner. Just means i have to watch more ipav to become better
[1:34:35] DontFeedPenguins: to me defense items seems useless since s13 if you arent going full tank
[1:37:16] kuschelketzchen: oh i forgot about that little pink ball item they removed
[1:37:34] oldschool_71: Experimental hexplate work on the cdr build?
[1:38:24] kuschelketzchen: is there any matchup you would maybe go full tank teemo in or is it always bad now?
[1:41:11] kuschelketzchen: I miss the ad teemo phase rush against champion like sion
[1:43:49] kuschelketzchen: Is there no matchup youre scared of?
[1:45:11] idizz_4: any tips for startup teemo players?
[1:46:08] DontFeedPenguins: @idizz_4 avoid poking near your turret since your toxic has 4 sec timer
[1:46:12] kuschelketzchen: For me i often lose on teemo but i dont enjoy any other champion as much
[1:46:17] Who__MD: whatever happened to that rumoured w rework?
[1:46:37] kuschelketzchen: @who__md what was the rumour?
[1:46:47] idizz_4: @DontFeedPenguins i will surely try to avoid that thanks1
[1:46:51] DontFeedPenguins: @Who__MD rolls from wild rift?
[1:47:11] Who__MD: I think it enabled him movement while invis, but slow
[1:47:36] kuschelketzchen: on passive?
[1:47:43] Who__MD: yeah
[1:48:11] kuschelketzchen: It would be interesting for invis to avoid gank
[1:48:26] idizz_4: yeah so actually the problem is, i started recently with league and because of my aggressive gameplay they said that i better play on top lane. so i try all the champions out that's why i asked
[1:48:28] razer_mon: ipavChad ipavChad ipavChad
[1:48:48] Who__MD: i still think q should apply on hit
[1:48:54] kuschelketzchen: I love the phase rush sound so much
