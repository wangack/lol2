[1:37:30] wetho: you think you ever gonna do a face reveal?
[1:37:33] TheChosenAngel: Thx a Lot @vabenice
[1:37:34] mistha1022: I've been building crit with jhin and it's been great, although it feels kinda weak early for some reason
[1:38:03] AliensSmokeToo: @mistha1022 u deal 0 damage before IE
[1:38:26] justfreakzii: @AliensSmokeToo even with IE zero dmg vs ksante xD
[1:38:32] mistha1022: i be buying IE 2nd or 3rd item
[1:38:41] ChaosHK: lethality is at this most powerful  when people have low armor. Crit is the best when you have a lot of damage already, on any champion
[1:38:42] Helluiin: LDR is too good imo
[1:38:45] Vabenice: @AliensSmokeToo yeah but thats ksante being ksante
[1:38:53] Helluiin: kata already applies anti heal no?
[1:38:58] ChaosHK: on her ult
[1:38:58] justfreakzii: he cant to tanky enemy team
[1:39:07] ChaosHK: which gets  troll pool'd

[1:39:18] AliensSmokeToo: @Vabenice nah even bruisers take no dmg from this
[1:39:27] Piemaster_7: highest quality na game
[1:40:07] limecat_t: gg nt
[1:40:13] Vabenice: @Vabenice yeah true mb, might be the new tank items ig
[1:40:14] snimeks: he knew before u ulted
[1:40:16] narwhegian: what a game
[1:40:21] ICGh0stZ: Gg ni
[1:40:31] ChaosHK: he was there as you ulted
[1:40:41] mEczem: brand was sus
[1:41:28] Dacnomaniak: He was hiding
[1:41:28] snimeks: @IKeepItTaco why start dorans blade instead of boots into brand lane? or just because thresh all in potential on twithc?
[1:41:58] limecat_t: Which is better this build or the lethality one?
[1:42:02] Vabenice: @snimeks thresh yeah, but thresh was lowkey bad
[1:42:19] Manskript_Klin: What you think about players who think NA GM = EUW diamond because NA is bad server?
[1:42:34] h4rrow_: Why is jhin 50% winrate when all meta adcs counter him
[1:42:51] Dacnomaniak: At least we have good teeth
[1:43:08] TopKeks_senpai123: what about China server
[1:43:13] jello_fiendy: @Dacnomaniak if you can afford it LuL
[1:43:14] wetho: 😭😭
[1:43:28] lbku: is it bad to go ie second after stormrazor? usually go storm -> ie -> rfc -> ldr -> bloodthrister
[1:43:41] Manskript_Klin: Ty for answer
[1:44:37] lbku: thanks
[1:44:43] leo_unleashed_d: nah but low diamond in euw is the wors game experiene . id rather play in iron 4 bro
[1:46:17] pers0na5133: pers0na5133 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:46:24] NgeNiousSK: @leo_unleashed_d Try it,bronze and iron is actual sewage,impossible to play in
[1:46:32] ChaosHK: I think this goes without saying, but there is a 99% chance we are going to lane alone a lot of the time
[1:46:57] lbku: do you miss the ad ratio on storm at all? have you noticed less damage?
[1:47:00] ChaosHK: 'bottom lane is lava' - Janna/Bard players
[1:47:01] la_kemono_lupus: hey enjoyer of the fourth 4
[1:47:34] ChaosHK: Jhin being the adc with the highest AD... yeah, stormrazor nerf hurt like a truck LUL
[1:47:48] wetho: how often do u post on yt
[1:48:23] purifish: wait is bloodline so weak that even jhin takes alacrity?

[1:53:06] leo_unleashed_d: poor janna , tough being a kid when parents are fighting
[1:53:09] ChaosHK: you'd be surprised with how much junglers expect supports to roam (for them)
[1:53:23] tej1991: Ap on jhin?
[1:53:24] purifish: wait what
[1:53:25] wetho: you can have Janna on weekends only

[1:54:47] mEczem: @ChaosHK really?
[1:54:47] tej1991: Traps I understand but such low probability
[1:54:54] NgeNiousSK: Is he actually going ap
[1:54:56] tej1991: I don't think it's worrh
[1:54:58] NgeNiousSK: ?
[1:54:58] AShinySubscriber: morello kinda sucks, better to just sit on the orb
[1:55:00] tomoya187: ludens
[1:55:12] ChaosHK: Yep, jhin q has an ap ratio
[1:55:21] tunabeard: Why not both?

[1:56:11] jhinspuppets444: Is that new build or situational one
[1:56:12] tej1991: Iv never seen ap on jhin
[1:56:14] Vabenice: you building a full item bro
[1:56:22] ChaosHK: Q has ap ratio, even if it's physical
[1:56:23] purifish: so you can never proc morello unless they take trap damage
[1:56:25] ayudunt: But why full item?

[1:57:47] ayudunt: Who let my man cook
[1:57:57] ChaosHK: por people who are still confused: AP works on Q, but not the orb
[1:58:05] Vabenice: @purifish the q deals physical damage but gets higher the more magic you build
[1:58:06] waftyknackers: doesnt lethality scale rly well with Q?
[1:58:27] purifish: its like trynd e, ap scaling but AD damage
[1:58:33] ChaosHK: we are absolutely getting reported this game YEP
[1:58:37] akirafudo0655: what is that build dude

[1:59:19] ChaosHK: codex builds into a bunch of items...
[1:59:22] leo_unleashed_d: august dont look / or buff AP jhin
[1:59:23] Migueltxou9: So you straight up trolled right KEKW

[2:00:08] purifish: this is just like the old dring meta
[2:00:11] purifish: but x100
[2:00:24] ChaosHK: I do like to point out that starting doran ring might be a legit strat for Jhin catYep
[2:00:26] AugustUwU: what AP items are actually good on jhin?
[2:00:39] hassan3616: there's no way you're not trolling
[2:00:39] purifish: lich bane

[2:00:44] purifish: idk

[2:00:48] shadowfax100: ap jhin woootttt
[2:00:51] Migueltxou9: Wait malignance doesent sound that bad right
[2:00:56] CictorGabriel: Is smolder against jhin that bad for jhin?
[2:01:00] spaghgbol: get cryptbloom for double flower spawn on a takedown, very artistic
[2:01:03] limecat_t: He had a vision guys
[2:01:10] hisanity: @Migueltxou9 yeah lower their magic resist for your full physical champion
[2:01:20] purifish: @spaghgbol nah magic pen is useless since only his e does magic
[2:01:28] tej1991: How do you get unlimited mana?
[2:01:39] DELT4_arg: @CictorGabriel i think its a mix between smolder and soraka not being a good match up for jhin and janna playing pasive
[2:01:40] Migueltxou9: @hisanity but e does magic, cdr on ult + extra dmg??
[2:01:48] ayudunt: The team is mentaly decaying Despairge
[2:01:49] spaghgbol: @purifish i know pal i was thinking more for the aesthetic purposes if you're playing jhin
[2:01:49] ChaosHK: He doesn't get unlimited mana unless he goes mandate KEKW
[2:01:49] reb0rn_o: seeing ur team fight in chat reminds me why I uninstalled this shit
[2:01:51] Migueltxou9: Wait e did magic right
[2:01:53] CictorGabriel: Lmao 4 bot
[2:01:59] black_vesper: manamune is probably more more suited for this than an AP item.
[2:02:11] magicalpen: I will admit I have been perma banning smolder lately feels good
[2:02:11] hisanity: @Migueltxou9 you'd have to ult them as they step on a trap and hope they don't just casually walk out of it
[2:02:26] AShinySubscriber: No flame taco, but im pretty sure none of the ap items you bought had mana or mana regen
[2:02:47] purifish: ludens maybe

[2:06:28] m0ns0: But if you want to spam Q - all you got to do is go mp5 rune. Why the wasted 1500 gold for useless items you will not use ever ever. Kappa

[2:07:11] Vabenice: @Skaftoise crit deals magic damage cuz of adaptive force
[2:07:15] Cuddle_with_Nami: Taliyah buffs?
[2:07:18] Silvah: @moot22 NOTED is that the mythic one?
[2:07:27] moot22: @moot22 Yes
[2:07:39] Skaftoise: @ikeepittaco imagine 4th shot scaled with AP

[2:08:00] Silvah: I never actually see that champ tbh xD
[2:08:03] CictorGabriel: D:
[2:08:05] Vabenice: @Skaftoise lorewise jhin infuses 4th shot with magic
[2:08:09] ChaosHK: on an unrelated note, apparently IE first is viable...? hmmMeeting  Also Stattik shiv has a massive wr on lolalytics, although only like 600 games
[2:08:16] SnowballBarrage: do you think smolder is good or bad?
[2:08:23] Fherlayt: how many items are you building at once?
[2:08:27] wetho: if I don’t leash in low elo you think I’ll get flamed?
[2:08:27] narwhegian: AP inovation
[2:08:32] Fherlayt: oh
[2:08:47] Silvah: morello only works on E I think
[2:08:48] ChaosHK: wait, is statikk actually more AD on jhin (for the price)? Hmmge
[2:08:56] vandrelan: I think they meant well designed
[2:09:01] browy_eu: @wetho low elo junglers have big ego, so they just won't gank you prob
[2:09:01] tome940: smolder me dood
[2:09:10] ChaosHK: 60%
[2:09:38] purifish: total ad or bonus ad
[2:09:42] ChaosHK: total AD
[2:09:44] purifish: cos those are very different
[2:09:50] Silvah: @wetho just mute all if you dont wanna leash
[2:09:54] ChaosHK: but total ad just means more base damage
[2:09:56] Skaftoise: What does a 4th bounce 3 minions killed look like on a squishy champ
[2:09:59] ChaosHK: doesn't affect the item calculation
[2:10:09] nekukaioken: hmmmm monkeee
[2:10:11] narwhegian: MONKE GONE
[2:10:12] ChaosHK: fully stacked Q is... let me check...

[2:10:19] limecat_t: Monke perished
[2:10:29] satty12345: I think the ap build procs extra mental damage now to the enemy
[2:10:33] Mcsevem77: MONKE will rise again
[2:10:35] limecat_t: I hate monke with a burning passion
[2:10:51] Vabenice: how can one hate MONKE
[2:10:52] ChaosHK: 297.25 + 133.25% AD + 123% AP , max damage Q
[2:10:57] Mcsevem77: KILL MONKE WIFE
[2:11:09] ChaosHK: for people who don't like math, max Q damage is 'you die'
[2:11:21] limecat_t: I can write and essay on how much i hate monke 🥹
[2:11:22] Mitrimo: @Chat why build crit this game?
[2:11:30] ChaosHK: we're testing crit

[2:12:04] Vabenice: @krodelu still meta, but he tries cirt
[2:12:12] Silvah: @nyxionite yes
[2:12:12] ChaosHK: the OG idea was storm + collect + ie
[2:12:16] Silvah: champ still sucks tho
[2:12:31] ChaosHK: although lolalytics says IE or even statikk shiv first are better than storm razor
[2:12:33] nyxionite: oh lol
[2:12:40] bardchime: I've been playing stormrazer/crit jhin quite a bit. I'm not a master player by any means but it has done better than lethality for me lately
[2:12:42] ChaosHK: and let me say this, IE first sounds cursed, but fun
[2:12:48] CictorGabriel: AP on jhin dont feel like a waste at all
[2:12:51] Silvah: @nyxionite he got buffed on last patch
[2:12:55] Soupman456: hi nyx lurkk
[2:13:00] Silvah: he went from being like a 44% wr champ
[2:13:03] Silvah: to 47%?
[2:13:07] nyxionite: hi soupi lurkk
[2:13:11] Silvah: smth like that
[2:13:14] wetho: what’s your win rate on jhin
[2:13:18] nyxionite: @Silvah oh LMAO what was the buff

[2:54:50] Cuddle_with_Nami: first timer
[2:54:50] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D

[2:58:40] RastaDB: Hi @ikeepittaco what is the new jhin build ?
[2:58:48] ChaosHK: he didn't have stun tho
[2:58:53] ChaosHK: he was level 1
[2:58:59] shadowm0narch: Azir with Leona and seraphine and Noone dodged damn

[3:00:23] ChaosHK: Mayeb shieldbow if you don't want zed to kill you in 0.5 seconds
[3:00:34] ChaosHK: (you still die in 0.8 Kappa )

[3:04:00] CictorGabriel: the team is hard scale at least
[3:04:14] ChaosHK: excuse me ma'am, that was our wave

[3:08:58] ChaosHK: it's harder to do in game than as a viewer, there's also that
[3:09:11] ayoublilou: what do u think about 200 Dollar jhin skin
[3:09:19] eddosart: it’s clever
[3:09:19] Cuddle_with_Nami: I mean, I'm really happy I learned that today
[3:09:28] niltentruger: Why dorans ring?
[3:09:34] siekiernik_pl: Jhin after denying kindreds mark: You will find your mak eventually.
[3:09:57] ChaosHK: Works botlane as well. Enemy support who was afraid even taking a single auto now walks into your poke? Jungler is coming
[3:10:10] ChaosHK: JhinkasJudge
[3:10:45] theblazebinder: In Early Hail of Blades is good for line faces using Critical items and fleet footwork is not good but can carry full damage in the late game, same Dark Harvest but it works with supp agresive or champ without tanks
[3:10:48] ChaosHK: celestial opposition leona eww
[3:11:11] demze97: how does the hail of baldes rune work with jhin?
[3:11:37] ChaosHK: you get atk speed and atk speed converts ito a lot of extra AD because of your passive
[3:11:46] ChaosHK: you don't actually attack faster tho

[3:12:09] Ali_Hasan20: as a team chat and taco
[3:12:19] ChaosHK: doran ring let us spam Q like mothertrucker
[3:12:20] flsh55: cuz of sera lane
[3:12:26] ChaosHK: and Q does have an AP ratio
[3:12:36] ChaosHK: and yeah, versus Sera we might as well perma farm
[3:12:43] waftyknackers: @demze97 it doesnt...it used to be bugged but no more

[4:15:15] wwaterbearer: >:3
[4:15:17] deathstalker12367: 7!
[4:15:21] Klony99: For example this Orianna player is obviously and quite easily a player who locks in Orianna more than once.
[4:15:21] wwaterbearer: SEVEN!
[4:15:30] admiralvonaal: 1,2,3 Seven! xD
[4:15:35] Klony99: I need a 7-Emote in the vein of ikeepitFOUR now.
[4:15:41] thebeautaeful: @Klony99 what about mine? DRAVEN/KASSA/TWITCH/KARTHUS/
[4:15:44] lbku: jhin with seven shots would be nice, though
[4:15:56] Klony99: @thebeautaeful You're indecisive.
[4:16:12] thebeautaeful: mhm
[4:16:27] JoJoNyoom: Nah mate, got sidestepped by a challenger minion
[4:16:32] Klony99: It's funny because it's true. :>

[4:19:07] thebeautaeful: @ChaosHK i think lulu ctrl + 4 spammers are the craziest
[4:19:24] Klony99: Zombie Brand laugh spammers.
[4:19:27] Klony99: Actual cancer.
[4:19:28] SuaveADC: thats the only reason to pick lulu @thebeautaeful
[4:19:41] supwemix: the most non toxic support players are mostly leonas/alistars
[4:19:53] ChaosHK: Okay, thanks, now I have lulu laugh playing in my head

[4:22:22] Klony99: @IKeepItTaco Dr. Who said he loves that about humans. That and coloured sugar sprinkles.
[4:22:26] FriskyKrispies: oof the janna
[4:22:27] wwaterbearer: ok legit question, but is it her job to get caught while u guys are on the other side of the map getting stuff? That's macro/split push right?
[4:22:39] MrRinghietto: you have heral
[4:22:39] KittySlayerLee: taco how old r u?
[4:22:41] The_Sleeping_Druid: hey taco how r the games goin today

[4:23:02] NapNapoleon: I'm waiting for taco to get caught to be proven wrong by fiora
[4:23:04] MrKassanova: @wwaterbearer sort of? i think you're supposed to draw attention but not die
[4:23:07] Klony99: @wwaterbearer No it's her job to draw attention and then retreat before the enemy can get her. Risking just enough to not get caught herself and buying time while fighting as long as possible. Every time she dies her lane gets pushed without resistance.
[4:23:16] wwaterbearer: ok thank u
[4:23:30] CictorGabriel: barack
[4:23:31] Klony99: KARTH IS BACK

[4:24:41] The_Sleeping_Druid: @Klony99 xd so true
[4:24:46] CictorGabriel: KEKL
[4:24:47] wwaterbearer: @MimiBonnyBun honestly agreed. my fave part of streams.
