[0:46:28] madiiiman: madiiiman gifted a Tier 1 sub to mohandaskaramchandghandi! They have given 4 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:46:28] madiiiman: madiiiman is paying forward the Gift they got from Shobes572 to mohandaskaramchandghandi! 
[0:46:34] registered_degenerate: Honestly this does seem like the only stream people would know the Luther you're talking about
[0:46:40] Shimmerz: he would be elbow deep in medical bills and other things dr buttz

[0:47:02] madiiiman: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is now enlightened
[0:47:09] kasttne: Why do you think T1 is weaker than BLG if they literally won worlds in the last 4 moths  and beat jdg with is better than this BLG version?
[0:47:14] kasttne: Like why?
[0:47:18] Kodord: and they lose two turrets
[0:47:24] TheEoldark: TheEoldark subscribed with Prime. 
[0:47:26] madiiiman: @kasttne its power rankings, record taken into account
[0:47:26] archie7497: What a shit play by hle
[0:47:29] Zebrios: @kasttne BLG's recent form is different from worlds.
[0:47:32] madiiiman: not based on what we think the teams peak will be
[0:47:32] alfredklorenzen: yeah, imma need 2 standard deviations. Im watching twitch, remember?
[0:47:41] mikejanderson: Fnatic macro
[0:47:44] kasttne: @zebrios ye but overall I take T1 over blg
[0:47:44] lkdrama15: @kasttne blg is 5:0
[0:47:52] Kodord: PeyzPal declined
[0:47:52] Zebrios: @kasttne I still think T1 is better overall, but BLG's ceiling has looked a bit higher.
[0:48:01] kasttne: @lkdrama15 overall T1 is better
[0:48:04] kottbulle2: another year of Viper geting hostaged Sadge
[0:48:04] hiimaeia: BLG's ceiling could be higher, that's why
[0:48:06] madiiiman: nah t1 ceiling blows blgs out of the water
[0:48:10] dayne93: jungle nautilus what a throwback
[0:48:27] acroyck: t1 has looked amazing with faker playing mid for his standards. once faker turns it up, they'll be clear #1
[0:48:30] kasttne: @hiimaeia well T1 potential has more than blg
[0:48:44] archie7497: Legit 1 kill for first tower gold. 2 tier 1 tower's local gold including mid tier 1 turret

[0:48:54] LautaroQ28: Is there any other autopsy video coming soon?
[0:48:57] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to rectalbleeding4prez!  
[0:49:04] Zebrios: @madiiiman I don't think so, and I'm a T1 fan. I think it's relatively even.  T1 is WAY more consistent, but BLG's mechanical play is a tiny bit higher.  If they both play peak, I think it's a flat out 50/50
[0:49:12] suprimo114: blg look cleaner than t1 rn imo
[0:49:15] madiiiman: WutFace RECTAL BLEEDING?
[0:49:16] madiiiman: WTF
[0:49:17] awoogawooogawoo: this is bait
[0:49:25] Zebrios: @LautaroQ28 Maybe Autopsy of DK as an org?
[0:49:34] TastyAMG: That's either nuclear cope or bait LuL
[0:49:36] kasttne: Ye but no way that this BLG is better than last year jdg
[0:49:38] IWillDumbinate: rectalbleeding monkaW
[0:49:57] suprimo114: where is senna ult there?
[0:49:57] kasttne: Last year jdg is stronger than BLG and they lost
[0:50:02] hiimaeia: even as a T1 fan I'm still suspect of faker's champion pool, if meta comes down to carry mids again I'd be worried
[0:50:05] madiiiman: tbh rectal bleeding could win Texas
[0:50:10] kasttne: This version of blg
[0:50:23] suprimo114: @kasttne how do you know they are better?
[0:50:31] kasttne: @suprimo114 names
[0:50:35] Roxsi_: Hello @MonteCristo do you believe Viper is still on the level of ruler and gala?
[0:50:37] Urclebaggins: because mental gymnastics
[0:50:38] thedeadoctopus: T1 lost to GenG because Adam was benched smh
[0:50:40] wiisoka: everyone is talking about T1 and BLG, but nobody talks about DK
[0:50:41] awoogawooogawoo: can we add a t1 fan emote
[0:50:42] SonsOfJarvan: "T1 lost to GEN bcause they were nonstopping going throgh tours and countries" XDXD
[0:50:49] acroyck: sometimes the worse team wins
[0:51:03] Prepo9: I think this HLE line-up would be way more interesting with someone like BDD or potentially Scout in the midlane. They feel kind of hard capped with Zeka
[0:51:03] irrelevant_ow: HLE seem so lost
[0:51:06] archie7497: if it's a top carry meta. Blg can easily be better than last year jdg.
[0:51:07] kasttne: Like jdg last year was  better than this BLG for a million of years
[0:51:08] twitchderp1: @MonteCristo do you miss clg?
[0:51:20] hiimaeia: if only GENG had HLE's duo bot, literally JDG 2022 level of superteam
[0:51:21] madiiiman: t1 lost to geng because t1 typically loses to geng and beats everyone else for some obscure reason. and then geng chokes international and T1 cleans up
[0:51:35] lkdrama15: btw why does do you have to be a t1 fan if you just have a opinion at monte
[0:51:38] madiiiman: viper is ridiculous
[0:51:38] Zebrios: I honestly chalk up T1's loss to GenG as "it's game 1 of the season" to some extent.  We all know how lazy T1 is early in a new split.  Those boys were fresh off an ego high from winning worlds straight into vacation.
[0:51:38] SonsOfJarvan: @madiiiman Causual t1 meatrider take
[0:51:43] registered_degenerate: @montecristo big thanks for predicting both the KDF and GenG wins Draftkings hates me
[0:51:47] bestaziraustralia: That loss was fake, gengs loss vs kt was also fake. I don't argue that BLG current Form is stronger than t1 but in a ko match I would never bet against T1 at this point, thoughts @montecristo
[0:51:50] kasttne: Zeka is good he's like a creme of lck
[0:51:51] vlagori: Isnt Doran a fraud?
[0:51:55] kasttne: If you compare
[0:51:56] fIuffee: doublelift in his prime was much better than viper but people don't want to admit that
[0:51:57] McDumps: Think if HLE had Chovy. Dream team amirite?
[0:51:58] saberaxe: @MonteCristo Doran still runs it so often
[0:52:01] KFCSaera: hle with a midlaner is just geng but with viper
[0:52:03] Prepo9: Viper is probably top 3 ADC in the world at the moment
[0:52:06] madiiiman: @fIuffee That's Bait
[0:52:09] TastyAMG: @kasttne insane levels of bait
[0:52:21] 4mation444: Would HLE be a contender if they had BDD for mid
[0:52:22] kasttne: Zeka is like the creme of lck @montecristo
[0:52:29] kasttne: He's not bad
[0:52:33] notmisty3: What would be the best mid to replace Zeka?
[0:52:35] madiiiman: @kasttne no, hes bad
[0:52:36] zaxcrie: @McDumps feels like they could give griffin a run for their money Kappa
[0:52:41] 4mation444: @fIuffee I think you need to buy more subs for more enlightenment
[0:52:43] kasttne: @madiiiman no
[0:52:47] dayne93: zeka was insane at worlds 2022 but outside of that, meh
[0:52:49] Zebrios: Zeka is good on some champs.
[0:52:50] Nasenfixx: @kasttne :D
[0:52:52] TastyAMG: Spotted the worlds glazer
[0:52:56] thedeadoctopus: I think HLE should pick up Perkz just to help out my boy Jankos
[0:52:59] Zebrios: If you give Zeka akali, he's a different person.
[0:53:00] weenteen1: hle should get shoemaker
[0:53:00] lkdrama15: @notmisty3 just throw money at kt and buy bdd out
[0:53:01] IWillDumbinate: Chovy CS PogChamp
[0:53:07] catast999: what are these people yapping about - a 2024 tier list should be based on performance and results
[0:53:08] archie7497: That's such insane disrespect on creme
[0:53:11] madiiiman: Ive said it before, the thing that always happens with these LCK Super teams is they either hit a wall whenever they play T1 in playoffs, or they choke internationally
[0:53:13] kasttne: He is the two only play assassin better than mages
[0:53:14] SonsOfJarvan: People, understand, ZEKA WON WORLDS CAUSE AKALI SYLAS WERE TOO FN OP
[0:53:14] notmisty3: @lkdrama15 yeah that sounds pretty sick actually lol
[0:53:17] Dabrens12: Funny to see how people in chat already beefing about who is better, when every teams played like 5 BO3 and 1 and a half patch SeemsGood
[0:53:21] bestaziraustralia: It feels like T1 in the end always has that clutch fakftor in kos, similar to the chiefs in nfl
[0:53:27] Youistheniqq: snowmaker to hle rather than bdd?
[0:53:28] SonsOfJarvan: Hes the Korean VETHEO
[0:53:29] madiiiman: geng has proven they can win in playoffs, but they choke internationally a LOT
[0:53:40] OceanLegacy: if the meta mid goes to zeka champs do you think he can get some form back
[0:53:50] madiiiman: KAppa
[0:53:50] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:53:51] saberaxe: GenG has gotten used to playing T1
[0:53:55] acroyck: t1 has the best support and top laner in the world... and faker
[0:53:55] awoogawooogawoo: trade kingen for perfect
[0:53:56] TastyAMG: Free my boy Viper
[0:53:56] madiiiman: Kappa yes get the band back together
[0:53:57] kottbulle2: Please taken Kingen from Damwon
[0:54:01] Dabrens12: @bestaziraustralia Before winning Worlds, this version of T1 was known for Chcking, like what are you talking about
[0:54:01] fIuffee: zeka is korean lider
[0:54:07] Prepo9: Everybody agrees but KT management LUL
[0:54:15] lkdrama15: @notmisty3 bdd would be se best option because he is always good and you dont need a big splash in mid because of viper
[0:54:16] madiiiman: no they wont give you a top laner for Kingen. you can play 4v5
[0:54:19] saberaxe: their fundamentals have been great in the LCK but they are not comfortable on the worlds stage
[0:54:27] suprimo114: apparently since t1 won something finally they will always win
[0:54:29] kasttne: Zeka was arguably the best Akali/sylas in the world in my eyes
[0:54:29] butelka_z_odzysku: can they make the trade during season?
[0:54:36] henxry934: what about theshy to dk
[0:54:41] TastyAMG: @kasttne You need glasses im afraid
[0:54:42] LautaroQ28: I just realized GEN botlane farm went to tahm kench instead of senna
[0:54:50] madiiiman: @kasttne WHEEZE
[0:54:53] kottbulle2: @kasttne You only watched worlds 2022?
[0:54:56] Prepo9: @kasttne He was for 1 tournament
[0:55:02] wiisoka: is showmaker washed ?
[0:55:03] fIuffee: caps is the best sylas/akali in the world to be honest
[0:55:05] weenteen1: @Dabrens12 losing a series that  goes to game 5 and down to the very last wire is not choking lol
[0:55:07] kasttne: @madiiiman it's just my opinion
[0:55:12] madiiiman: Zeka patch zerged one tournament that was also the worst performances weve seen in YEARS from faker and chovy
[0:55:14] saberaxe: @MonteCristo Where is the best location for Tarzan to go
[0:55:24] madiiiman: if either of those 2 play even half of their peak drx loses
[0:55:27] lkdrama15: @kottbulle2 he was good in a meta who both were broken as fuck
[0:55:29] Zebrios: Guys let's not pretend Zeka isn't still good on Akali.  That's just disingenuous and bandwagon-y.  He's still good on THAT champ.  The problem is he sucks at most of the meta champs
[0:55:34] Dabrens12: @weenteen1 loosing like 4 Finals in a row is chocking my friend
[0:55:46] Zelgius: 0-3 dragons with Lucian Nami though, HLE didn't make it difficult
[0:55:47] fIuffee: goldenglue would outperform zeka on every champion besides akali
[0:55:51] madiiiman: @weenteen1 some are chokes. some arent
[0:55:51] TastyAMG: @madiiiman Never seen a player have an entire career off one tournament before LuL
[0:55:51] dayne93: those equalizers are pretty good
[0:56:00] Dabrens12: specially when they were favorite most of the times @weenteen1
[0:56:14] madiiiman: @weenteen1 to be clear, 2 of the LCK finals were not chokes, geng were heavy favorites going in
[0:56:18] kasttne: I actually think KT is better than hle .....
[0:56:23] Zelgius: The Lee Sin R-Q outplay
[0:56:32] lkdrama15: @Dabrens12 can you both stop its pathetic, you both never will agree so stop argue
[0:56:36] TastyAMG: its so fucking nice to see Kiin on a good team finally
[0:56:38] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! cristoYORD
[0:56:43] mikejanderson: Kdf > hle i fear
[0:56:47] arielleej: I feel so bad for Viper man. Someone give this guy a real roster.
[0:56:48] kasttne: This game 2 was Actually more close
[0:56:50] Zizonyx: kiittwSmirk
[0:56:50] lkdrama15: @mikejanderson yes
[0:56:56] Faramir: Did you know there was a chance of Kiin coming to LEC a while ago, that wouldve been cool
[0:56:59] dah777: i wish viper was on geng, that would be insane
[0:57:01] Faramir: To replace Odoamne
[0:57:05] saberaxe: Doran makes me sad
[0:57:07] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: Hows it going Monte, and Chat?
[0:57:09] kasttne: @arielleej and on paper this is not a real roster?
[0:57:11] weenteen1: @Dabrens12 They had young players, some who were rookies. They needed time for exp and growth imo
[0:57:11] TastyAMG: @Faramir not for kiin enjoyers WutFace
[0:57:13] chrysalide97: @MonteCristo Thoughts on what could have been if Viper joined JDG instead of Ruler in 2023?
[0:57:17] madiiiman: Viper on geng might actually be good enough to carry chovy when he chokes internationally
[0:57:18] NightShado81: @MonteCristo I wanted to ask you about the ashe prio in LPL and from T1? do you think its a good B1
[0:57:19] notmisty3: Well he can't be toxic if his teammates don't understand him right?
[0:57:25] Krethas: @arielleej I'd feel more bad for viper if he weren't on this long streak of choosing bad teams to join
[0:57:28] TastyAMG: @chrysalide97 Same result or worse most likely
[0:57:34] Faramir: how dare you slander world champion Zeka
[0:57:39] arielleej: @Krethas OK, fair.
[0:57:40] TastyAMG: its pretty much a side grade
[0:57:43] McDumps: @MonteCristo Can't wait for Zeka to be on TL next year.
[0:57:43] Zelgius: Zeka will re-enact the Fly arc
[0:57:48] madiiiman: No, Adam shud go to KwangDong. he will sort him out REAL quick
[0:58:05] zaxcrie: zeka should go to lcs and get better, just like mark
[0:58:07] Lez1994: Lez1994 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:58:10] awoogawooogawoo: Is there beach paradise in korea?
[0:58:14] lkdrama15: @dah777 no because viper cost money and you have a salary cap also peyz is not bad he is good and can get better
[0:58:15] Prepo9: @Krethas long streak? he won worlds with his last team?
[0:58:25] kasttne: @zaxcrie he won words and go to LCS with 21 years is sad
[0:58:36] madiiiman: @dah777 they have the money, and idc how good you think Peyz might get, hes not becoming viper
[0:58:44] Dabrens12: @McDumps Should have gone this year, even TL don't want it now LUL
[0:58:47] Roxsi_: chovy yone time?
[0:58:48] zaxcrie: @kasttne mark said it was the best oppo for him, why wouldnt it be similar?
[0:58:49] TastyAMG: Salary cap is such fake news
[0:59:00] Zebrios: @madiiiman You literally cannot predict that.  Peyz has a LOT of room to grow.
[0:59:00] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:59:03] TastyAMG: its a luxury tax not a cap
[0:59:03] madiiiman: viper is arguably a top 5 adc of all time. Peyz will never get there
[0:59:20] kasttne: @madiiiman I think this is only your opinion
[0:59:22] Zelgius: Chovy is gonna try a new recipe
[0:59:23] TastyAMG: @madiiiman He's top 3 for me
[0:59:44] lkdrama15: @madiiiman no they dont have they are not a hle or dk or skt even kt who is much bigger had to pay less
[0:59:54] thedeadoctopus: @madiiiman For sure, Ruler, Viper, Gala, Uzi and doublelift
[0:59:59] Lez1994: Do you think Briar ever will be played in pro play despite being a one dimentional champion?
[1:00:02] saberaxe: Viper basically dragged EDG to that worlds win
[1:00:03] fIuffee: viper is for sure top 3 adc of all time Uzi Doublelift Viper Perkz Deft?
[1:00:08] madiiiman: i have viper 4th but he cud easily be 3. its difficult to rate him vs players like Weixiao's era
[1:00:14] TastyAMG: @thedeadoctopus bro said doublelift AINTNOWAY
[1:00:29] chrysalide97: @TastyAMG Nah... not only is Viper a better ADC than Ruler, he's chinese is also better for comms
[1:00:44] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 geng is not backed by a big company as monte did say
[1:01:02] archie7497: @montecristo btw can you explain how riot chooses to buff or Nerf champions? Cuz brand was a semi prevalent pick in pro and gets insta nerfed out of pro viability but udyr doesn't get touched despite it being pick or ban in every region beside lec
[1:01:08] madiiiman: guys i want to be perfectly clear, the only way geng cant get viper is if he doesnt want to go. they 100% can afford him
[1:01:08] TastyAMG: @chrysalide97 JDG comms really weren't that big of a deal they were silent most of the time. viper could be better but Ruler was not the problem is my point
[1:01:13] Roxsi_: viper got better highs but i believe ruler is more stable
[1:01:19] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 they dont can spend whatever and in lck you have a salary cap
[1:01:28] mikejanderson: I prefer how draft here
[1:01:32] mikejanderson: Hle*
[1:01:35] gerbilsdontexist: what the hell is twitch's passowrd rules? I made a password 5 minutes ago that I dont remeber because thats how strict it is
[1:01:39] madiiiman: you do not understand a salary cap if you think they cant get viper
[1:01:40] suprimo114: peyz is on a rookie contract so he's way cheaper
[1:01:40] Prepo9: Why am I seeing MULTIPLE claims in chat that Doublelift is a top 5 ADC ever?
[1:01:43] TastyAMG: @lkdrama15 i dont think you know what a salary cap is
[1:01:52] madiiiman: there are soft caps and hard caps
[1:01:53] thedeadoctopus: @archie7497 balance changes are based off of 2 things. Random stats and how Phreak feels at the time
[1:01:55] madiiiman: nfl is a hard cap
[1:01:55] KFCSaera: chovy 1st timing hwei on stage vs hle LUL
[1:01:57] madiiiman: mlb is a soft cap
[1:02:02] madiiiman: lck is a soft cap
[1:02:02] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  personally I think Caitlyn is underpicked, since last year. its absurd
[1:02:04] Zelgius: @Prepo9 just don't feed the trolls
[1:02:07] madiiiman: you can go over it whenever you want
[1:02:10] LautaroQ28: What about siege though? Hwei has a lot of controlled range, with aphelios and Jax could split push? or no?
[1:02:14] KFCSaera: LCK's cost cap is similar to the NBA
[1:02:15] Lez1994: is there any avaible midlaner that could zeka's spot now if they would want to replace him in next split?
[1:02:19] weenteen1: People rating doublelift as a top 5 ADC? I thought this channel increased IQ
[1:02:22] dayne93: Isn't rell's engage pretty good if she has flash?
[1:02:27] lkdrama15: @madiiiman yes mr i dont know what geng is and what a salary cap is
[1:02:35] kasttne: I don't know why XIN is not a pick in lck
[1:02:51] Zebrios: I could see an argument for DL being top 10 ADCs based on legacy in the game, but top 5?  Ehhh, no, not really.
[1:02:57] thedeadoctopus: Upset/Targa playing Caitlyn Ashe Aware
[1:03:36] LautaroQ28: Rhel is pretty low range as well even with flash
[1:03:41] acroyck: @Prepo9 same reason some people think caps is a top 5 mid... western bias
[1:03:43] TastyAMG: @thedeadoctopus Targamas griefing for 0 reason Aware
[1:03:52] Peter_Sabbasen: Non commital engade>>>>
[1:03:55] lkdrama15: @madiiiman they dont have the money
[1:03:57] FuHua_HoS: I wish BDD and Zeka can change teams. That way we get a DRX 2.0 and HLE gets an actual stable midlaner
[1:03:57] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Thoughts on my hypothesis that the best team comps ALWAYS have at least 1 form of non-committal engage?
[1:03:59] madiiiman: @Prepo9 any1 who thinks caps is a top 5 mid all time needs a lobotomy

[1:04:11] archie7497: @thedeadoctopus we really are beholden to lord phreak it seems
[1:04:11] thedeadoctopus: Caps used to be a top 5 mid in 2019/2020
[1:04:13] madiiiman: those people are too dangerous to exist
[1:04:21] thedeadoctopus: not since though
[1:04:22] fIuffee: caps legitimately is a top 5 mid right now
[1:04:24] madiiiman: @thedeadoctopus yes he was a top 5 mid that year, and never at any other point
[1:04:28] madiiiman: and not before either
[1:04:40] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  because you run into the mind games with conditional engage, you can bait summoners, and then actually comit
[1:04:42] weenteen1: @Zebrios I dont think he even makes top 10
[1:04:44] fIuffee: madiiiman i'm sorry but I think you might be delusional üòî
[1:04:50] sliferthegreat: @montecristo what happened to Save after he was jailed in LSPL for all eternity ?
[1:04:54] madiiiman: @fIuffee you think caps is top 5 mid all time?
[1:04:57] madiiiman: whats ur top 5
[1:05:00] madiiiman: enlighten me
[1:05:02] archie7497: Also in what world did maokai need buffs? Why the fuck did it get buffed in 14.3
[1:05:03] fIuffee: reread my message madiiiman
[1:05:15] oODemonPandaOo: oof. first game of this series was ROUGH lol
[1:05:22] Mykah9: is there a world where ashe isn't a support outside of a re work for her?
[1:05:27] Lez1994: do you think there is possible to draft and play for heavy splitpush now? like fiora
[1:05:29] zaxcrie: @madiiiman tfw we see more western players in lol hall of fame than makes sense LUL NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:05:48] TastyAMG: @Mykah9 Sure you just have to nerf every meta adc into the ground lol
[1:05:51] madiiiman: @fIuffee yeah no
[1:05:55] McDumps: @MonteCristo It's cool they put the My Chemical Romance lead singer as a playable character in League.
[1:06:05] Prepo9: Im closing chat for a bit, there are some outrageous takes in there at the moment LUL
[1:06:09] TastyAMG: @McDumps ICANT
[1:06:09] Zebrios: @weenteen1 Honestly I don't think he does either, but I could see an argument for it at least.
[1:06:19] madiiiman: @fIuffee which of ur msg? none are accurate?
[1:06:21] fIuffee: top 5 mids of all time are faker > knight > bjergsen > caps > nemesis
[1:06:26] kasttne: I think hle needs a better coach too
[1:06:30] madiiiman: @fIuffee LMAO
[1:06:37] lkdrama15: @madiiiman yes he is in a world where no asian mid exist so you are right
[1:06:38] fIuffee: madiiiman reread the one where i called you delusional and keep reading it until it sets in
[1:06:39] madiiiman: monte tell me thats timeoutable
[1:06:39] TastyAMG: Now we are just smoking crack in the chat
[1:06:40] thedeadoctopus: @fIuffee Gigachad
[1:06:43] madiiiman: thats the worst take ive ever seen
[1:06:46] madiiiman: Kappa
[1:06:48] TastyAMG: iwdC
[1:06:55] Juudailol: @fIuffee HUH
[1:06:55] Mykah9: @fIuffee seems legit, but you forgot doublelift
[1:07:09] NeptuneDweller: @madiiiman its a blatant troll stop wasting ur time
[1:07:11] lkdrama15: @thedeadoctopus no you forgot jojo
[1:07:11] madiiiman: @fIuffee you just said nemesis caps and bjerg are top 5 mids all time, you domnt get to call any1 else delusional
[1:07:22] madiiiman: none of them crack top 10
[1:07:26] madiiiman: including caps
[1:07:30] alnorte_delsur: How is bjerg above caps? Nah, reported for that top 5
[1:07:32] Turole: @fIuffee Bjerg!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Nemesis!?!?!?!?!
[1:07:34] LautaroQ28: That 2v1 dive was super clean
[1:07:34] NightShado81: @MonteCristo do you think camille here is better as a r5?
[1:07:38] kasttne: Is KT looking better than hle for you guys?
[1:07:59] Binnsey: @MonteCristo Hey Monte you look great! :)
[1:08:02] weenteen1: @madiiiman talent and game knowledge wise, Nemesis is actually very good. I think he's as good as a lot of korean mid laners
[1:08:14] Zebrios: @weenteen1 That's cap.
[1:08:15] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: HELLO MONTECRISTO? DO YOU LIKE NEWJEANS?
[1:08:22] TastyAMG: The real question is if a western player is in the top 5 in any roll all time Thinkge could stretch it to top 10 even
[1:08:23] gerbilsdontexist: did Peanut use his Q to get out of the raptor pit?
[1:08:24] madiiiman: @weenteen1 i dont doubt nemesis game knowledge. but he is not anywhere near good enough to be top 5
[1:08:31] Zebrios: @weenteen1 Unless you're including Korean academy midlaners
[1:08:33] TastyAMG: @Ïß§Ïû¨Î£° he doesn't like kpop so imma go with no
[1:08:34] alnorte_delsur: I mean, Bjergsen is top 5 WESTERN for sure, no?
[1:08:36] madiiiman: @TastyAMG are we counting impact and/or corejj?
[1:08:39] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: @TastyAMG WHY NOT
[1:08:41] lkdrama15: @NightShado81 camille is death after the wall change
[1:08:43] thedeadoctopus: Nemesis could be insane but we will never know at this point lol
[1:08:45] TastyAMG: @madiiiman no
[1:08:47] weenteen1: @madiiiman not top 5. but hes close
[1:08:54] madiiiman: i do think LCS shud be allowed to clkaim Core but not impact
[1:09:21] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: @TastyAMG Í∞ïÌï¥Î¶∞ is charm and beauty too
[1:09:21] twitchderp1: both casters sound similar to monte with different accents
[1:09:21] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:09:23] madiiiman: @weenteen1 Nemesis is not close to top 5 im sorry. hes accomplished nothing and eye test doesnt make him that high either. knowledge argument needs results to matter that much
[1:09:28] TastyAMG: after the crimes i've seen core commit these past few years LCS can keep him LuL
[1:09:35] madiiiman: nemesis isnt even top 10 all time
[1:09:45] weenteen1: @madiiiman he's a way better player now than he was in fnc
[1:09:48] suprimo114: if any western player is top 5 in their role all time it's probably jankos
[1:09:51] madiiiman: @TastyAMG Jankos is top 10
[1:09:57] weenteen1: well maybe not WAY better but he has improved.
[1:09:58] fIuffee: @madiiiman it's time to stop caring so much about which players are the bets üòî you're embarrassing yourself
[1:09:58] TastyAMG: @Ïß§Ïû¨Î£° idk what that means but im happy for you
[1:10:00] fIuffee: BEST
[1:10:02] madiiiman: @weenteen1 i dont disagree, but that doesnt make him top 10
[1:10:02] Shimmerz: Travis gafford streaming to 55 people on magic the gathering, appears to be eating sushi. good to see him diversifying his content finally
[1:10:05] ashenlotus: @MonteCristo  what would be your dream team
[1:10:06] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: @TastyAMG ????
[1:10:08] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 you never can hit your e
[1:10:21] fIuffee: there's a genuine argument for reginald in top 10 mids of all time
[1:10:21] TastyAMG: @madiiiman him or mikyx are the only ones i can see being top 5/10
[1:10:24] Zebrios: Jankos would be top 5 if he won a worlds title.  Until he does, I can't put him there.  He's quite good at peak, but he just doesn't have the accomplishments.
[1:10:39] TastyAMG: @fIuffee OMEGALUL this is good bait holy
[1:10:40] Shimmerz: those were amazing
[1:10:40] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: does monte like t1
[1:10:42] madiiiman: @TastyAMG theres none in top 5. top 10 jankos is in, miky is arguable and doublift is also arguable
[1:10:42] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: i love t1
[1:10:47] kasttne: nimayuCry nimayuAgua
[1:10:49] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: t1 is handsome team!
[1:10:51] madiiiman: @fIuffee OMEGALUL
[1:10:56] Shimmerz: and don‚Äôt forget doas 30 people streams
[1:11:01] awoogawooogawoo: last time i watched your bg3 its 300 viewers
[1:11:04] TastyAMG: @madiiiman There are so many cracked adcs idk if DL could even crack top 20 monkaS
[1:11:06] Zebrios: Peanut did literally nothing here.  Why even come up?
[1:11:16] Mykah9: Meanwhile, Meteos is teaching a masterclass on smoking league and playing weed...
[1:11:17] gerbilsdontexist: he should have stunned someone after they aggroed the TURRET!
[1:11:21] alnorte_delsur: Reginald is Top 3 worst owners that also happened to be midlaners
[1:11:21] gerbilsdontexist: BAD PLAY!!!
[1:11:25] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: METOES SMOKE WEED??????
[1:11:27] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: WEED ILLEGAL
[1:11:31] saberaxe: did doran hit a sweat spot?
[1:11:34] catast999: he used it melee
[1:11:52] Zebrios: peanut played this dive HORRIBLY
[1:11:58] LautaroQ28: @Ïß§Ïû¨Î£° stop the caps
[1:12:05] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: @LautaroQ28 oh sorry sorry
[1:12:08] suprimo114: best jax in lck
[1:12:09] TastyAMG: The video of Meteos going 0/20 while high as fuck on weed is so funny LuL
[1:12:12] LautaroQ28: No prob <3
[1:12:19] gerbilsdontexist: yes he did! he should have stunned someone after turret aggro!
[1:12:21] cryow1zard: hey money monte
[1:12:24] gerbilsdontexist: so they trade 1 for 1
[1:12:24] fIuffee: its time to cover peanut in salt and honey and roast him üòî
[1:12:31] Zelgius: Peanut should've CCed 3 people and gave Doran his flash back
[1:12:33] madiiiman: 01:02 AMSubscriber fIuffee : nuc is likely a better player than faker when you consider all the variables
[1:12:34] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: best jax lck = ÏµúÏö∞Ï†ú<3
[1:12:37] TastyAMG: @fIuffee That sounds nice
[1:12:40] KFCSaera: he q's rell w
[1:12:49] lkdrama15: he should r the jax
[1:12:49] fIuffee: @madiiiman true statement
[1:12:49] gerbilsdontexist: if he ulted jax aatrox also survives
[1:12:51] madiiiman: this dude is apex troll
[1:12:53] TastyAMG: @madiiiman Nuc is the faker of LEC - IWDominate
[1:12:59] madiiiman: @madiiiman I buy that
[1:13:09] catast999: yes
[1:13:09] halojib: he does turret blocks it
[1:13:10] leodzien: yep
[1:13:16] mikejanderson: Should probably look for the trade on kiin yea
[1:13:17] gerbilsdontexist: yeah he did
[1:13:18] iluld: ya]\
[1:13:18] ashenlotus: yeah
[1:13:20] Sebla: he does
[1:13:20] Peter_Sabbasen: Its crazy that dobblelift is talked about more then rekkles here in terms of contender from the west on the all time adc list. Rekkles and Forgiven is probably the two that was closest to being the best adc itw.
[1:13:22] milano357: he used it there look it seju weapon
[1:13:23] 7ekje: when rell gets knocked up
[1:13:24] twitchderp1: he had to ult jax just to make sure someone dies
[1:13:27] Lez1994: yeh u can see the small bump in poro butt
[1:13:29] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: @Peter_Sabbasen best adc is bang
[1:13:30] milano357: at*
[1:13:37] Sebla: but he should just ulti whoever is tanking tower no?
[1:13:41] TastyAMG: OMEGALUL
[1:13:45] Zebrios: Still, Peanut still didn't play this well at all
[1:13:53] Zelgius: There is 0% chance Doran lives without flash
[1:13:58] lkdrama15: r the jax and then jax could die from 1 more tower shot
[1:14:08] lkdrama15: and you q the rell
[1:14:09] zaxcrie: @Peter_Sabbasen rekkles supp now Kappa
[1:14:24] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  fair point, but rell isnt going to dps that aatrox down tho
[1:14:25] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:14:25] Gondawn: Could he not hold ult for a bit?
[1:14:25] saberaxe: doran also needs to hit sweet spots with his q
[1:14:25] Zebrios: I would've ulted rell and immediately Q'd on jax.  He loses an auto and either dies in trade or has to flash and maybe Doran lives.
[1:14:25] TastyAMG: True Rekkles isn't an ADC player
[1:14:27] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: im super shy
[1:14:29] halojib: the dive is to good for GEN, its more of an out play than a missplay
[1:14:32] alnorte_delsur: If he had Q, was the play R Rell then go on Kiin?
[1:14:35] lkdrama15: you q the rell and r the jax who q in
[1:14:45] Zelgius: @Zebrios I look forward to your promotion into LCK
[1:14:54] LautaroQ28: Do you think the map changes for the later patches were positive?
[1:14:56] fIuffee: rekkles was a great player that was cursed to play with mediocre teammates his entire career
[1:14:56] cryow1zard: is zeka showing growth? havent watched lck yet this season
[1:15:04] Zebrios: @Zelgius Don't bring that argument in here.  You don't need to be a good chef to recognize bad food.
[1:15:04] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: monte you should listen to hype boy by newjeans <3

[1:26:02] Ïß§Ïû¨Î£°: nuc bds mid laner say that?

[1:28:29] Veila24: Did the Bullets have Kakao or Score, I assume Score since Monte glazes him all the time
[1:28:31] madiiiman: Kappa i can make so that the phrase X > Faker all time is automod detectable using a variable to catch any input interesting
[1:28:31] shinrenz: I think Monte is doing the ultimate KT supporting. He's not getting excited, nor he doesn't care about them. And then they'll actually eventually win worlds
[1:28:32] naocorrijo: did you cast the kt superteam? or were you already in ow

[1:39:15] madiiiman: @madiiiman Chiquita Bananas overthrew the government of guatemala in 1954
[1:39:20] madiiiman: they staged a coup with the CIA
[1:39:25] madiiiman: to protect their operations
[1:39:34] catast999: zeka plays for kda annd dies anyway

[1:40:41] cryow1zard: the funny part is he prob thought to save for fight but he dont even use it in fight aggressively XD
[1:41:02] madiiiman: Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz executed government policy Decree 900. Being a land reform program, this policy expropriated and redistributed 372,000 acres‚Äîor 400,000 football fields‚Äîof unused farmland to the region‚Äôs landless peasants in hopes to reduce the nation‚Äôs dependence on Chiquita‚Äôs monopoly Despite already owning the majority of the land, Chiquita perceived this policy as a threat to its operations and sought revenge.
[1:41:03] madiiiman: To protect its operations, Chiquita exploited the 1823 Monroe Doctrine to evoke a U.S. invasion to overthrow Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz. The Monroe Doctrine stated that any foreign attempt to interfere with the Americas‚Äô security will threaten U.S. interest and elicit a U.S. response.
[1:41:10] madiiiman: for those of you who doubted
[1:41:18] lkdrama15: @Zelgius man you dont play to win you play for stats as zeka

[1:51:38] madiiiman: it gets a lot worse when you realize what weapons they were using. they had mounted Lewis guna on humvees
[1:51:43] Peter_Sabbasen: But Emu's are also rly tanky
[1:51:44] naocorrijo: you'll have to swap kt with hle in your power rankings after this series eh
[1:51:47] Krethas: @MonteCristo years ago you said broadcasts weren't making enough shoulder content or crafting new narratives. Has it gotten any better? Do podcasts like POG state help?
[1:51:49] roivas1: @MonteCristo what do you think of bds kicking adam for toxic behavior right before their semifinals match? n
[1:51:50] madiiiman: mounted machine guns and they cudnt deal with the emus
[1:51:59] madiiiman: look up a lewis gun and tell me a bird shud win vs that
[1:52:04] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  did you play league before starting to cast it?
[1:52:04] TastyAMG: @madiiiman my brother in christ they couldn't kill some emus with a HMG?
[1:52:10] najafan: I mean, there's a reason one of the few species humans systematically hunted to extinction just to get rid of it was the Moa.
[1:52:13] madiiiman: @madiiiman yes
[1:52:18] Phaetox: No they often said the Emus would tank the bullets like "zulu warriors" which probably didn't age well
[1:52:30] TheShrekkoning: long hair leather jacket monte KappaPride
[1:52:33] madiiiman: oh ya the emus were tanking hits
[1:52:42] Krethas: Always a downside when it comes to riot improving things, hah
[1:52:47] madiiiman: but if they had lost the war to cassowaries, respect. I aint fucking with that bird
[1:52:51] madiiiman: but emus?
[1:52:56] cryow1zard: is it bc of ai? are they being replaced byy ai? bcuz cmon they have the money...
[1:53:05] Tameimpala2: Instead of guns they have used last whisper to take down the emus
[1:53:06] CloudSidky: oh wow you were like one of the first to play it
[1:53:12] madiiiman: Kappa Monte was roomates with the only good rioter
[1:53:14] naocorrijo: did you cast the kt superteam or were you already in owl?
[1:53:21] Peter_Sabbasen: @madiiiman put some respect on the emus
[1:53:30] Adanion: so you could say that Monte inspired LoL esports
[1:53:43] madiiiman: @Peter_Sabbasen I respect them, but when you have mounted Lewis Guns on trucks, you have to win
[1:53:44] McDumps: Did you watch Serral vs Maru?
[1:53:57] CloudSidky: riot is known to be very grateful lol
[1:53:58] Oldystoteles: and it all went downfill from that point
[1:54:05] Adanion: The Father of LoL Esports, but yet Montes most hated child LUL
[1:54:07] ElCrabs: did you hear about the Sheep Esports- Why Adam was benched piece?
[1:54:11] awoogawooogawoo: How is razork humannoid synergy?
[1:54:21] Kodord: so its montes fault riot sucks!
[1:54:38] TastyAMG: @ElCrabs bold of you to assume those clowns knew before monte did LuL
[1:54:38] dayne93: That champ select music is dope
[1:54:39] madiiiman: I stand by my belief that part of why riot fucked sand monte so hard was you were the only caster who they cud see at the time making their own brands like caedral did nowadays
[1:54:45] Ikkarrow: @madiiiman Look riot company culture is fucked but I refuse to believe every person at that company is a horrid person
[1:54:50] madiiiman: doa and monte*
[1:54:51] Oldystoteles: can u tldr it?
[1:54:56] madiiiman: @madiiiman i know i was memeing
[1:54:59] Tameimpala2: wait im ootl whats wrong with adam?
[1:55:00] Binnsey: what did adam do?
[1:55:00] cryow1zard: what motivates you to stick around with the game the most these days? and over the years
[1:55:02] lexlaigh: sawaNya
[1:55:09] ElCrabs: @TastyAMG more like when its out... whats his take
[1:55:09] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:55:10] madiiiman: @Tameimpala2 psycho. rage quit scrims massive anger issues apparently
[1:55:12] CloudSidky: @Ikkarrow it's probably culture yah
[1:55:13] weenteen1: What did he do? @MonteCristo
[1:55:14] kerokerogrips: what is the real life sports equivalent to the adam situation ?
[1:55:15] goodpostureguy: @Tameimpala2 benched for being toxic right before semi
[1:55:16] archie7497: Yup. Striker is a boss.
[1:55:19] killerwhalekj: least psychotic Darius player
[1:55:20] Tameimpala2: wtf
[1:55:22] Peter_Sabbasen: But the Emu's had time on their side. Australia couldnt put too many recorces into it, so they just had to stall. And they also had alot of ground to move around on.
[1:55:27] TastyAMG: @ElCrabs ah fair
[1:55:33] archie7497: @weenteen1 toxicity
[1:55:35] najafan: @madiiiman Hell, some people are saying we should de-extinct Moas. And that's just asking for trouble.
[1:55:43] madiiiman: @Peter_Sabbasen they had MOUNTED HEAVY MACHINE GUNS I cannot stress this enough
[1:55:46] najafan: Those things are way worse than Cassowaries.
[1:55:50] lexlaigh: humzhHmm
[1:55:56] Adanion: @madiiiman 100% riot dont hire caedrel if they know he gets bigger then than like he basically is now
[1:55:56] weenteen1: @archie7497 well yeah but whaqt did he do?
[1:56:03] Ikkarrow: @CloudSidky At this point riot games is more or less a cult and people do not know they are employees of a cult
[1:56:24] CloudSidky: @Ikkarrow yah its kinda sad
[1:56:39] CloudSidky: when i was in highschool i thought of working at riot 2
[1:56:41] archie7497: @weenteen1 don't know what words he used but he argued with his coaches and rage quit scrims etc
[1:56:43] Peter_Sabbasen: @madiiiman but the Emu's are Emu's. Fast, agile and tank asf. Basically real life ksante's
[1:56:45] CloudSidky: wouldnt have known any better tbh
[1:56:49] Suga__Shane: @montecristo love all the LFN content, when is the new episode of 4play dropping?
[1:56:54] XLOftw: i wanna be a League coach, any tips Monte ?
[1:57:01] XLOftw: advices*
[1:57:03] madiiiman: its the reason they got rid of you and monte
[1:57:04] weenteen1: @archie7497 ah ok, ty
[1:57:11] madiiiman: they saw it wud happen with the ogn casters
[1:57:35] TastyAMG: the muzzle velocity of the .303 British round is 2,440ft/s i doubt emus can run that fast
[1:57:38] 0neinchash: And it kinda is okay
[1:57:41] Shimmerz: is the real answer that their product is so shit people prefer costreamers
[1:57:43] teddylear: @montecristo you think adam booted or he coming back
[1:57:58] suprimo114: its like if tastosis costreamed starcraft
[1:58:08] poizuun: fuck riot in general @MonteCristo
[1:58:14] Ikkarrow: how did Cadrel beat riot
[1:58:16] cryow1zard: karma
[1:58:22] madiiiman: they kicked crownie for nothing, this isnt nothing

[1:59:33] madiiiman: thought it might have been appendix
[1:59:33] madiiiman: it wasnt
[1:59:40] OceanLegacy: I would watch without caedrel
[1:59:41] offcorser: I am one of those people, someone who chooses Caedrel over the official broadcasts
[1:59:53] weenteen1: who is Ibai and why is he so famous?
[1:59:55] Tameimpala2: is he in the hosipital after fighting an Emu? monkaW

[2:00:17] najafan: @Tameimpala2 Cassowary, actually.
[2:00:17] TastyAMG: if Dom didn't do LEC i just wouldn't watch. i can't do the main broadcast of any league except LPL
[2:00:19] Stormserpent101: I prefer watching people like Dom and Yamato for costreams feels more like a community and less like a circus

[2:00:37] CloudSidky: ok brb will get ready to be mad
[2:00:38] Krethas: I don't really understand costreams. They're not exactly real time analysis, and feel more like reaction content which I don't enjoy
[2:00:41] killerwhalekj: what‚Äôs your first team?
[2:00:41] TheDoctorPolo: I walked in on my college professor watching it once lol
[2:00:42] Avarizz: on tonights show, how much do u talk about Adam not being there? or should u just act like its a normal serie and this is just hte level of play?
[2:00:47] 0neinchash: Is co-streaming paid? @MonteCristo I wonder if riot need to change rules of it so they earn something for viewership being gone at least from streamer with big viewership
[2:00:54] Cabbygt: I haven't watched it, but I'm already angry.
[2:01:00] Clyde1500: where's the real power ranking? RaccAttack enjoyment
[2:01:04] Adanion: *goat team
[2:01:05] VanidarD: im not mad about T1's ranking, but I think your ranking of KT and KDF is way too high
[2:01:06] madiiiman: LUL
[2:01:09] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  Pyosik is the ultimate fraud!

[2:01:27] I4mM4n8earp1g: which honestly  like how many other sports are out there allowing people to rebroadcast their content and run thie rown commentary. If Any streamer ran an NFL game and got near the viewers of the actual brodcast they would be sued into dust
[2:01:30] najafan: cristoCAKE cristoCAKE cristoCAKE cristoCAKE cristoCAKE cristoCAKE
[2:01:43] knightmahre: Im usually an Elyoya hater but youre right in that hes been lookin damn good this split

[2:02:25] lkdrama15: no but why is top esports so low they only lost to BLG 2:1
[2:02:26] poizuun: @MonteCristo  who do you think wins tomorrow?
[2:02:33] gerbilsdontexist: G2
[2:02:37] the_stuu: could Elyoya win mvp?

[2:02:58] Tameimpala2: if you aint first, youre last KKona
[2:03:06] jvrvilela: hey monte, why did the grog coin end up not working out?
[2:03:07] Clyde1500: top esports has top in their name. they should be on top Kappa
[2:03:11] Mykah9: have you read their team name? They should be at the top
[2:03:13] definitly_not_tommy: why is KDF only 9th, i think they should be atleast 5th.
[2:03:13] Oldystoteles: Kapap
[2:03:16] TheDoctorPolo: I love watching cream play
[2:03:16] offcorser: Always remember: if ur not #1, ur literally shit
[2:03:20] Hide_in_Jungle: It seemed like Hillysang never listened to Elyoyas calls tbh, thats why they sucked
[2:03:20] definitly_not_tommy: KDF Truthers
[2:03:21] Stormserpent101: Myrwn is actually such a bright spot on this whole roster. feels like he'll be a generational top laner assuming he doesn't drop off
[2:03:22] OceanLegacy: why is blg so low
[2:03:25] lkdrama15: they could be 3rd only lost to the best team
[2:03:27] madiiiman: Why is BLG only 1st monte? Kappa
[2:03:29] madiiiman: how about 0th?
[2:03:30] naocorrijo: KT >>> HLE
[2:03:35] lkdrama15: xd
[2:03:36] CloudSidky: @madiiiman loooooool
[2:03:42] goodpostureguy: top 0 only
[2:03:42] phamtastic_: not good enough monte
[2:03:46] Mykah9: At the top where else monte?
[2:03:47] CloudSidky: blg have ascended beyond
[2:03:48] najafan: Why is C9 so low?
[2:03:48] Tameimpala2: i owuld put them top 1
[2:03:58] VanidarD: @najafan KEKL
[2:03:58] lkdrama15: it was only a joke
[2:04:02] Krethas: whenever people say "why is X team at Y rank", they should be required to bring up who above them should be below, or who below should be above
[2:04:05] trueaether: I'm just mad that T1 is placed 2nd, and that its really hard to argue otherwise after what Geng did vs KT
[2:04:06] najafan: Why isn't V5 #1?
[2:04:12] TheExperienceAwaits: You should obviously invent a number to put them at.
[2:04:12] lkdrama15: i had to do it
[2:04:16] TastyAMG: BLG 1, TES 2, JDG 3, GenG 4, KC 5 BASED

[2:05:02] TastyAMG: @madiiiman What's wrong with my super serious power rankings? :>
[2:05:04] archie7497: How myrwin can play tp ignite akali into ksante and come out even in lane is so mind-boggling. Doesn't ksante get akali's shroud whenever he wants and brand can come kill him pre 6 since akali doens't have flash
[2:05:06] CloudSidky: @cryow1zard no way. swift 3-0 for g2
[2:05:09] madiiiman: Kappa uh ksante?
[2:05:13] Ikkarrow: Taking the current states of T1 and BLG odds of winning a Bo5? If it were to happen now
[2:05:23] TastyAMG: im mad T1 is top 5

[2:05:47] VanidarD: @TastyAMG same bro, but im more mad at reality for that, than mad at monte lol
[2:05:49] CloudSidky: @Mykah9 top 100
[2:05:58] TheDoctorPolo: oh yeah
[2:06:05] lkdrama15: @Mykah9 80

[2:06:12] TheDoctorPolo: listen
[2:06:19] madiiiman: Kappa whats the difference monte?
[2:06:22] TheDoctorPolo: I didn't think it that through lol
[2:06:22] najafan: @Clyde1500 True, they should have been the fifth Chinese team sent to worlds in S12
[2:06:27] AntiquusTonitrus_3: has BLG faced their  daddy JDG
[2:06:28] CloudSidky: @Mykah9 they are, but at what cost
[2:06:36] TastyAMG: Rookie's career these past few years makes me sad man
[2:06:38] TheDoctorPolo: I have a fine arts degree okay
[2:06:38] TastyAMG: Sadge
[2:06:45] trueaether: I meant that T1 should have been lower than 2nd, but geng sent it too hard
[2:06:47] knightmahre: Supa definitely Arrow esque right? /s
[2:06:50] madiiiman: i mean he is A Rookie
[2:06:51] Stormserpent101: well @MonteCristo he is a rookie Kappa
[2:06:55] madiiiman: so technically its accurate
[2:06:59] Phaetox: Replace Zeka with Rookie. Bring him home.
[2:07:14] knightmahre: Rookie back in the LCK would be a dream come true
[2:07:16] fcloud: to be fair, he's a doctor of Polo, not esports
[2:07:24] naocorrijo: rookie can only come back to kt pls
[2:07:24] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: And also why is Senna farming and does not have support item
[2:07:26] Mykah9: @CloudSidky I mean it isn't like NA will make it out of plays from the lower region teams
[2:07:31] TastyAMG: @knightmahre he probably should come back at this point but i dont think he will

[2:07:52] cryow1zard: everyones been a rookie at some point. Rookie gotta change his name to Veteran lol
[2:07:59] madiiiman: @knightmahre pretty sure at this point Rookie's chinese is better than his Korean
[2:08:02] knightmahre: @Mykah9 NRG > G2 thought? Even if its just NRG playing better on the day they still made quarters
[2:08:10] CloudSidky: @Mykah9 i think they will though
[2:08:12] TastyAMG: @madiiiman Yea that's one of the reasons i think he wont come back
[2:08:25] definitly_not_tommy: is MDK like Koo Tigers, A really fun top laner to watch, Insane jungler, dont talk about mid.
[2:08:26] trueaether: some targeted Dom and Rich flame from Supa
[2:08:30] TastyAMG: Doesn't he have a chinese wife or am i thinking of someone else
[2:08:39] madiiiman: what do u mean monte? they speed up xin and then he flash engages Kappa
[2:08:39] dawnetc: do you think grubs are a good addition to the game?
[2:08:41] Haziri_: No I am still not directly paying since using prime. So I can only ask for semi-pleb
[2:08:48] najafan: I know a literary criticism website that calls itself an "Eruditorum".
[2:09:02] jpegexe: everyone picks for lane
[2:09:07] Mykah9: I just don't have faith in NA having the disciple to run it to quarters again
[2:09:08] jpegexe: or comfort
[2:09:09] OceanLegacy: is naut not primary engage
[2:09:17] VanidarD: they do have xin on mad I guess
[2:09:18] madiiiman: Kappa ksante ult the flanker back to his team
[2:09:18] lkdrama15: because it is Eu
[2:09:30] knightmahre: @jpegexe this for sure, coaches or players are playing a reactionary draft rather than something cohesive
[2:09:48] najafan: Naut can hook in, duh?????!?!?!?
[2:09:54] lkdrama15: sorry emea
[2:09:55] Phaetox: Xin blocks ori ult if the ball is in it but she isn't right?

[2:10:06] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Naut QR?

[2:10:58] CloudSidky: why is it important especially this year?
[2:11:00] najafan: Right I tell you.
[2:11:04] Ikkarrow: Funny enought the only game I saw was game 5 of this match
[2:11:05] DazyLave: is jarvan jungle any good?
[2:11:10] madiiiman: idk why people didnt take LS MTG comments seriously
[2:11:12] TastyAMG: AINTNOWAY
[2:11:13] madiiiman: they were clearly accurate
[2:11:35] Peter_Sabbasen: @knightmahre reactionary drafting isnt a problem, but you have to think more if you draft reactionary and do well. I will say that if you draft reactionary well you will win draft most times
[2:11:36] TheDoctorPolo: Did the rammus pyosik game actually make sense or were they just happy gaming? I haven't been watching it
[2:11:39] najafan: @madiiiman I think he got some specific things wrong, but broadly he was correct, yeah.
[2:11:42] Veila24: What's your favourite best-of series of all time @MonteCristo hard mode, no ROX vs SKT 2016 semis
[2:11:43] meeechow: I think any jungle that can engage is good right now even if they themselves are not good.
[2:11:57] DazyLave: yes basically
[2:11:58] madiiiman: ls ranks champs into colors based on the role they play in a team
[2:12:08] madiiiman: red for aggro go in types
[2:12:19] TastyAMG: @Veila24 My guess is he will answer KT vs IG 2018 Worlds Quaterfinals
[2:12:21] madiiiman: blue for control magic types
[2:12:23] Mykah9: MTG teaches you a lot in gaming
[2:12:36] knightmahre: Jun over Trymbi must be one of the most questionable trades of the year too though right? I'm sure Noah appreciates having another korean on the roster but theyve both been rather suspect this split. Razork such a blessing
[2:12:38] DazyLave: the mtg analogies are super good when forming team comp identity e.g. poke comp, teamfight engage etc
[2:12:43] najafan: So he would talk about drafting synergistic comps based on champs that have the same colors.
[2:12:46] madiiiman: the faker ryu finals
[2:12:46] FzeroTV: @Mykah9 thats because its the best game period
[2:12:50] Fortune49: oof
[2:12:52] madiiiman: is the best bo5 ever played
[2:12:56] killerwhalekj: Ryu aware
[2:12:59] oMrGo: When will we know why Adam wasn't playing in semis?
[2:13:03] jpegexe: rox v skt worlds semi pretty sick
[2:13:07] TastyAMG: @oMrGo we already do
[2:13:10] Phaetox: Tbf blue side comp kinda smacks hard engage by absorbing it with aoe karma senna shields, braum wall, xin...
[2:13:12] madiiiman: its the moment Faker became a God and the stories coming fromt hat point make it unbeatable
[2:13:13] najafan: And, in general, he said Jeskai was OP in league, iirc.
[2:13:13] Fortune49: shen press R
[2:13:17] TheDoctorPolo: What was the final you and Doa casted in the rain?
[2:13:21] najafan: Blue/Red/White.
[2:13:22] the_stuu: rox skt > any other Bo5
[2:13:23] Crushzilla: @killerwhalekj does he still play?
[2:13:24] DazyLave: rox vs kt rolster 2016 summer was a banger series with monte doa papasmithy tricast
[2:13:25] knightmahre: @TastyAMG what is the reson then if you dont mind me asking?
[2:13:25] Shimmerz: I dunno monte, DOA didn‚Äôt bring enough gravitas to the faker ryu outplay for that the be the best of all time
[2:13:32] TastyAMG: @Shimmerz xdd
[2:13:33] DazyLave: 2 hp smeb steal
[2:13:34] madiiiman: @DazyLave monte is still scarred from that series
[2:13:42] xeherxan: @oMrGo issue with coach
[2:13:44] Anganthyr: rox skt was good yeah
[2:13:53] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @DazyLave wait i don't remember that
[2:13:53] definitly_not_tommy: i was watching the podcast you, thorin, and dom made about the all time goats by role. Do you still think Smeb is the Goat of top lane?
[2:13:55] jpegexe: What series was it where KT lost baron to gangplank ult
[2:14:00] dawnetc: thoughts on farming senna?
[2:14:00] madiiiman: guys dont mention rox kt in 2016, he still hasnt emotionally recovered
[2:14:01] TastyAMG: @knightmahre The TLDR is he was a cunt to his coach the full reason with their responses are on reddit
[2:14:05] bruhuserlol: If you want to pick Karma do you also need to pick away Senna?
[2:14:19] TastyAMG: Ruler is my goat BASED
[2:14:21] DazyLave: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo such a fun series
[2:14:23] knightmahre: NBS vs SKT in S3 was such a banger series too. Watching Fakers Ahri vs Nagne Gragas was actually exciting af back in the day
[2:14:23] DixMX: sup Monte and chat
[2:14:23] awoogawooogawoo: adc is the most contention
[2:14:24] madiiiman: Kappa that KT superteam had 4 of 5 best in positions
[2:14:32] killerwhalekj: 2022 worlds has some best bo5 serieses
[2:14:32] oMrGo: Not Bang? lol
[2:14:33] ytirucesdnaycavirp: @MonteCristo Id give Ruler goat eye test
[2:14:34] najafan: @DazyLave Yeah, the best part about them, imo, is that it doesn't just do poke vs disengage vs team fight, etc, it also talks about secondary and tertiary themes in a single draft and synergies that develop.
[2:14:34] trueaether: its probably between Deft and Ruler at this point
[2:14:35] Shimmerz: which players did the most with the least
[2:14:37] Peter_Sabbasen: Msf vs skt 2017 was a funny bo5, tho
[2:14:40] Veila24: Anybody knows the tea about why Adam didn't play today?
[2:14:40] saberaxe: Is it not Ruler?
[2:14:42] lou_saso: do you think Zeka is the weak link for HLE?
[2:14:45] Tameimpala2: not piglet? AAAA
[2:14:49] TastyAMG: @Veila24 its on reddit
[2:14:53] awoogawooogawoo: OOOO
[2:15:00] madiiiman: @saberaxe Deft has more achievements than Ruler tbh
[2:15:01] leamfor: A plague on BDS and FNC for allowing MDK into top 2. AAAA
[2:15:02] DazyLave: @najafan big true. the multiclassing comp synergies
[2:15:16] knightmahre: @MonteCristo top 3 junglers for EU this split?
[2:15:17] Anganthyr: do the Asians care about goat because as a European it is a very foreign concept
[2:15:27] jpegexe: the post would just get removed
[2:15:27] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:15:28] phamtastic_: give it some time
[2:15:32] oMrGo: Game 5 is like Elyoya solo carry
[2:15:34] TastyAMG: @madiiiman idk if he does with how much Ruler stacked trophies last year and how impressive he was
[2:15:43] hairykintama: @knightmahre RAZORK?
[2:15:45] Crushzilla: maybe someone already did and a mod removed it LUL
[2:15:45] leamfor: @saberaxe Don't they have most of the same achievements?
[2:15:46] Naxser: @MonteCristo They're bussy with the Adam Drama
[2:15:47] Phaetox: I'd up vote your rankings even if I disagree
[2:15:54] knightmahre: I think Razorks been killing it tbh
[2:15:56] awoogawooogawoo: Bo?
[2:15:57] TastyAMG: @Naxser gachiHYPER
[2:15:58] bruhuserlol: Surely it's just Yike Razork Elyoya in that order
[2:16:04] archie7497: It's razork imo
[2:16:05] madiiiman: @TastyAMG Deft at his peak was better than ruler, and they both have worlds and MSI and multiple domestic titles
[2:16:07] DazyLave: Razork one of my favorite eu players
[2:16:07] Fortune49: more LFN Culture content coming?
[2:16:09] KFCSaera: This serioes i feel like razork played better
[2:16:12] sugarygapeman: is jankos still good
[2:16:19] knightmahre: Feels bad man that this is probably the first split Jankos hasnt been top 3
[2:16:21] madiiiman: deft rn is not better to be clear
[2:16:23] TastyAMG: @madiiiman i'd value Ruler's MSI much higher than Defts simply because it was a harder tournament to win
[2:16:29] Stormserpent101: @MonteCristo your content on reddit allows for potential wrongthink. the great riot firewall is contemplating it
[2:16:30] Kodord: holy shit they just melted
[2:16:31] TastyAMG: but i could see the peak argument
[2:16:39] madiiiman: @TastyAMG Deft went thru prime faker in a bo5 TECHNICALLY Kappa
[2:16:47] TastyAMG: its a 1A 1B sort of thing
[2:17:04] leamfor: Where would you rank FLY? @MonteCristo
[2:17:07] mikejanderson: I agree
[2:17:07] awoogawooogawoo: why lethality jinx not common
[2:17:34] TastyAMG: @madiiiman wdym Faker is still in his prime rn. the T1 fans told me so!
[2:17:34] Phaetox: Karma good with xin but not akali
[2:17:35] leamfor: @troll754 Zapp isn't low enough CD
[2:17:40] gosulkk: @MonteCristo how would u round up a comp with karma mid/ xin jg?
[2:17:41] jpegexe: scuttle just tanked that brand stun loool
[2:17:49] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Karma RE-ing all the melees engage
[2:17:50] bruhuserlol: How do you play no engage vs Brand Jinx?
[2:17:54] archie7497: @montecristo mad has a kite back comp which gets outranged until Senna has 100 plus souls
[2:18:00] Phaetox: Jax
[2:18:01] knightmahre: Maybe with Rakan support?
[2:18:02] madiiiman: i mean i have ruler 3rd all time adc just cuz i have always felt he didnt have that sort of super saiyan mode you sometimes see adcs go into. I've seen it from Viper and back in his hayday deft did it too. You can argue ruler is just more controlled so he doesnt need to play like that, but eyetest on prime deft and viper is absurd
[2:18:10] leamfor: An Ornn
[2:18:11] Phaetox: Jax Shen Kennen
[2:18:14] juntzj: next weekend LPL got 3 days of bangers back to back to back, monte gonna be busy lol
[2:18:24] DazyLave: Karma Rammus
[2:18:27] JoncIaude: dp you think karma is overrated then? Seems hard to find a place for her? @MonteCristo
[2:18:33] madiiiman: the thing i always struggle with is that i cant find a way to put Uzi higher than 4th...
[2:18:33] KFCSaera: @MonteCristo have you seen MAD's voice comms? they are really clean for a "new" team
[2:18:40] TastyAMG: @madiiiman That's fair. its all about what you value. there are so many factors that go into the GOAT calculation
[2:19:02] DazyLave: thoughts on the braum pick?
[2:19:13] kitkatbar5: 5/0 brand already?
[2:19:19] killerwhalekj: Why tf is not  being picked in lck
[2:19:20] madiiiman: @madiiiman I basically view players like Uzi, Viper and Guma to have in essence a "Devil Trigger" mode if you know what I mean. the 1v2 guma had in semis for example
[2:19:20] TastyAMG: @madiiiman a lot of people have been coming to that conclusion lately. he was a god in his era but he has been surpassed and forgotten unfortunately
[2:19:31] leamfor: That's why I say Ornn.
[2:19:35] madiiiman: Jackylove is what happens when you never leave that mode tho
[2:19:35] Phaetox: I think karma mid is mega op but NOT with bloodsong that's a flavor of the month bait
[2:19:36] madiiiman: KEK
[2:19:43] gosulkk: yeah braum is a good pick imo but kinda feels out of place in this comp
[2:19:45] DazyLave: @madiiiman Sadge
[2:19:48] e6merald6: since she's broken with malignance then maybe she's good on poke comps?
[2:19:51] TastyAMG: oh jackylove LuL
[2:19:53] rogaine_saintvicious2: whats up foooools
[2:19:54] archie7497: Aware
[2:19:55] madiiiman: I love Jackylove man
[2:20:00] madiiiman: most fun adc to watch ever
[2:20:03] Kaljorlol: Kaljorlol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! LUL
[2:20:10] TastyAMG: Hate to love him and love to hate him. its jackylove LuL
[2:20:15] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @TastyAMG You mean EDG Deft when he went to China or Samsung Blue?
[2:20:31] madiiiman: @TastyAMG SSB Deft and his first year or two in China

[2:20:46] TastyAMG: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo in that thread we were talking about Uzi
[2:20:55] Phaetox: Oh malignance not bloodsong idk these new names yet

[2:21:20] bored_steve_1: why doesnt naut count as primary engage?
[2:21:22] UnLuckyNiko: why is Naut bad for primary engage?
[2:21:23] leamfor: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo EDG beat SKT at MSI 2015. I watched it live
[2:21:24] DazyLave: 2016 Deft GIGACHAD
[2:21:37] madiiiman: @leamfor KKoma beat SKT at MSI lets be very clear
[2:21:45] TastyAMG: @madiiiman indeed
[2:21:52] knightmahre: Its situational primary engage though right? If he misses the hook its GG
[2:21:53] lkdrama15: @killerwhalekj lck never picks champs on the patch they get buffed if its not a common pick, they need 1 patch and then they pick.
[2:21:55] Phaetox: Karma jayce are good too the poke is mega get with a varus ashe or something too
[2:21:57] madiiiman: anyone who doesnt admit SKT wins that series 3-0 or 3-1 with faker playing all games is kidding themselves
[2:22:04] that_guy_who_games: @MonteCristo Nightly reminder you're the real banger here
[2:22:15] madiiiman: its the one time Kkoma's ego got the better of him
[2:22:26] madiiiman: and its why Easyhoon nbever played bracket stage at worlds
[2:22:39] Kaljorlol: Is there a good reason we don't see too much flash on top lane these days?
[2:22:43] lalamasterrace1987: them KR hooks be scary
[2:22:55] Mykah9: @MonteCristo how would a leona change the team for MDK?
[2:22:55] TastyAMG: @Kaljorlol it has to do with the champs that are played
[2:22:58] jpegexe: they gave mad the only way to fight
[2:23:00] DazyLave: Chinese Nautilus > Korean Nautilus
[2:23:05] mikejanderson: 3 ults used on braum and they keep going is crazy
[2:23:06] Crushzilla: ksnate trying to 1v3 at this point is just bad
[2:23:09] lkdrama15: @UnLuckyNiko the problem is he is not a good ball carrier because he never get in the enemy team like a rell does
[2:23:12] jgeo_: it's like they blanked on humanoid using ult
[2:23:43] madiiiman: monte braum's incredible masculinity made them feel inadequate, he had to die
[2:23:46] Doorpost877: monte is it valid for me to be extremely excited for SI after this adam news? @MonteCristo
[2:23:50] goodpostureguy: i told u guys, this series is disgusting
[2:23:51] danielmp_02: they cant drake, mad was going to fight it anyways
[2:23:54] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Senna W into Karma RE to chase the W'd target primary engage xdd
[2:24:12] madiiiman: i have to go get some blood work done. behave chat! ill be back soon
[2:24:20] knightmahre: @Doorpost877 Curious where Thoorin will go, just gives the man his flowers and he goes and fucks his team in semis
[2:24:30] yanya7701: who won this series?
[2:24:31] DazyLave: later madiiiman
[2:24:37] thugitakhrushchev: xdd Monte, are you liking the LEC gameplay??
[2:24:43] TastyAMG: @madiiiman gl, hope you recover soon boyoHUG
[2:25:05] zen__cloud: i feel like oscarinin griefed this series
[2:25:12] themickbeingcarried: @MonteCristo Do you think LEC's regression is primarily due to allowing talent to stagnate chilling on the couch or is it more systemic with VC bucks leaving and that messing with support/coaching staffs with different orgs playing musical chairs with franchise spots?
[2:25:12] Possibly_Chance: At least drake is better than just running it down on the other team LMAO
[2:25:14] that_guy_who_games: They are afraid of (Insert engage here) Its living rent free
[2:25:18] jgeo_: how are the spectator timers still this buggy?

[2:26:19] archie7497: Oscar went from one of the best toplaners in week 1 to one of the worst in week 6

[2:27:29] knightmahre: Imagine Rogue going back to Finn instead of trying to get Odo back
[2:27:33] themickbeingcarried: Yamato should've learned French smh
[2:27:38] leamfor: KC would still be bad LUL
[2:27:47] DazyLave: Targamas is trying to speak telepathically to his team but doesnt realize they cant hear him
[2:27:53] TastyAMG: @themickbeingcarried Bro learned 5 languages and not a single one is French ICANT
[2:27:55] Kaljorlol: 2013 SKT vs 2015 SKT? Let's go bois
[2:28:13] EvolutionWar: Imagine if yamato was French he would still be a coach xD
[2:28:24] danielmp_02: U will no believe it tomorrow too
[2:28:30] thugitakhrushchev: @themickbeingcarried i feel like he would have genuinely put time into learning French. I think he already knows multiple languages.
[2:28:34] lkdrama15: mad lions should buy import the best player in the world zeka

[2:29:20] thugitakhrushchev: @TastyAMG yeah lol
[2:29:31] TastyAMG: KC doesn't deserve Yamato, Upset or Bo Sadge
[2:29:40] thugitakhrushchev: @TastyAMG TRUE
[2:29:55] PinnxelGRP: There is a nonzero chance that MAD wins the LEC tomorrow. PepeLaugh
[2:29:57] themickbeingcarried: It's fine guys, Yamato is just vacationing on Corsica atm, HE'LL BE BACK

[2:31:31] Phaetox: Nice for ezreal too
[2:31:35] burdil3z: yoya is the igl for sure
[2:31:39] TastyAMG: The funny thing is there is no good outcome for LEC finals
[2:31:39] danielmp_02: supa is 5-0 with senna in playoffs
[2:31:54] lkdrama15: @danielmp_02 senna is broken
[2:32:02] TastyAMG: either G2 wins and the region looks like shit or Mad win and the region looks completely hopeless
[2:32:15] TheBasedTaka: are the supports supposed to be 10 levels down
[2:32:17] Phaetox: The akali pick is bad
[2:32:19] danielmp_02: is trash if u r behind imo
[2:32:22] lkdrama15: ori is legit next to ksante if naut r her she dies
[2:32:27] DrakeAcula: @PinnxelGRP not actually cause the meta doesn't cater to that but one of the easiest for sure
[2:32:37] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh Wait till you see the result of Game 1
[2:32:37] BuggleStrus: This whole series is sus drafts
[2:32:37] PinnxelGRP: @TastyAMG I disagree, MAD looks good they can definitely beat their MSI any% record from last year PepeLaugh
[2:32:44] TheBasedTaka: he has support item passive though

[2:32:52] TastyAMG: @PinnxelGRP oh true PogUU
[2:32:54] PinnxelGRP: @DrakeAcula G2 should win for sure but MAD have a habit of bullshitting finals
[2:33:04] EvolutionWar: Unless mad Lions actually gives g2 a good fight with good play
[2:33:06] yanya7701: wait who won between MAD and BDS?
[2:33:14] majesticcchim: is there a bug? Alvaro is always dead everytime I look
[2:33:15] PinnxelGRP: MAD 3-2
[2:33:20] DrakeAcula: @PinnxelGRP that team no longer exists
[2:33:20] Veila24: @yanya7701 G2
[2:33:26] Mykah9: @yanya7701 clearly BDS won, right guys?
[2:33:26] TastyAMG: @EvolutionWar Still not good for the region imo
[2:33:40] PinnxelGRP: @DrakeAcula but the faith remains Prayge
[2:33:51] TastyAMG: Can't wait to see Adam play in the finals FeelsGoodMan
[2:34:07] thugitakhrushchev: @TastyAMG xdd
[2:34:07] madiiiman: I‚Äôm back chat. did you behave?
[2:34:08] EvolutionWar: True but its better than g2 dominating a shit team
[2:34:18] TastyAMG: @madiiiman Surprisingly yes
[2:34:21] TastyAMG: also that was fast
[2:34:23] madiiiman: good
[2:34:26] Veila24: At least LEC has G2 to a 1-team region. In NA we
[2:34:30] Veila24: are a 0-team region
[2:34:40] madiiiman: yeah they just got blood from the IV I already have in my arm lol
[2:34:46] madiiiman: no need to stick me again
[2:34:48] TastyAMG: ah that makes sense
[2:34:58] PinnxelGRP: @Veila24 wdym we got the only western team to quarters last year
[2:35:08] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh this fight
[2:35:11] EvolutionWar: I think the general level in na is pretty good
[2:35:11] madiiiman: I‚Äôm honestly not sure why they have left it in considering I‚Äôm drinking water and they are only using it for saline atm
[2:35:13] danielmp_02: myrwn will clap tomorrow bb trust me
[2:35:13] gosulkk: ok akali just blew them up
[2:35:14] yanya7701: @Veila24 thats very true but dont be surprised when G2 lose to a no team region's team again lol
[2:35:47] madiiiman: merwyn? more like merlyn

[2:35:49] PinnxelGRP: @MonteCristo did razork have armguard for that fight?
[2:35:52] Veila24: @PinnxelGRP quit trolling bro, NRG had the literal series of their life vs a G2 that heavily underperformed. You will never again see any of those NRG players perform that well
[2:35:55] archie7497: @montecristo look at brand flash at the start of the fight
[2:35:59] stephcurrysim: tbf that sequence is entirely on razork
[2:36:11] PinnxelGRP: @Veila24 doesnt matter, NRG is   EU's father
[2:36:11] madiiiman: Monte welcome to the Razork Cake
[2:36:15] lkdrama15: razork has to move whit the team or naut has to mark akali
[2:36:20] leamfor: When Inspired son's EU again, I can't wait for EU copers to stfu again.
[2:36:23] madiiiman: FNC are a Razork Cake
[2:36:29] yanya7701: @Veila24 but G2 will underperform again thats the problem lol
[2:36:30] enemydown49: this crowd tho.. they hyped af LOL a bit cringe
[2:36:56] stephcurrysim: that's not on jun at all, it's on razork for being in range of a flashless akali just to clear a pink
[2:36:57] Veila24: @yanya7701 But G2 underperforming does not equal NRG being good though
[2:36:59] Evan_Ralston: Razork stopping to clear the ward was kind of troll too
[2:37:03] gosulkk: but if jun stays on the back guarding who engages
[2:37:04] PinnxelGRP: @yanya7701 nah bro this is the year, they havent won a BO5 since 2020 but surely this is the year
[2:37:12] Mykah9: I see the mistake razork made
[2:37:13] awoogawooogawoo: he ulted dead akali
[2:37:14] danielmp_02: he used in akali
[2:37:16] leamfor: @enemydown49 Unironically cringe for thinking fans at a sporting are even a little cringe for being hyped.
[2:37:17] Tropicano4V: but jun has to do too many thing in this comp, protect jinx, do engages, too many things
[2:37:18] lkdrama15: after akali r in him
[2:37:21] stephcurrysim: how are you blaming jun for that LOL
[2:37:21] DazyLave: did akali have zhonyas?
[2:37:29] yanya7701: @Veila24 no one is saying that though all I am saying is G2 will underperform again and lose to NA teams again no matter what team that is
[2:37:33] awoogawooogawoo: yes
[2:37:34] thugitakhrushchev: xdd Peak LEC Gameplay
[2:37:34] themickbeingcarried: @Veila24 Just better than EU Lmao
[2:37:38] KFCSaera: ye just as she was dying
[2:37:41] Veila24: @yanya7701 that other guy was saying that lol
[2:37:41] madiiiman: Monte just take a bite of the Razork Cake. it‚Äôs delicious we promise
[2:37:43] KFCSaera: u can see the red circle below her
[2:37:45] Mykah9: razork should have followed ori across the top instead of going into river
[2:37:51] enemydown49: @leamfor if you say so :)
[2:37:54] EvolutionWar: Razork brought akali to kill humanoid as well LUL
[2:37:55] stephcurrysim: or razork could have just.. not tried to clear a pink in akali range?
[2:37:55] yanya7701: @Veila24 then hes not very smart
[2:37:57] Evan_Ralston: why did Razork stop to clear the ward?
[2:38:09] TheBasedTaka: why braum here?
[2:38:20] PinnxelGRP: Having casters work in technical errors into their casting is my fetish Kreygasm
[2:38:20] DazyLave: "ooo a piece of candy" -Razork
[2:38:29] burdil3z: @TheBasedTaka for brand
[2:38:30] Azzololl: naut ksante is fine engage
[2:38:34] gosulkk: nah razork hard trolled there
[2:38:43] that_guy_who_games: cristoLCS cristoLCS cristoLCS
[2:39:15] AntiquusTonitrus_3: cristoLCS cristoLCS cristoLCS cristoLCS
[2:39:18] leamfor: Ksante is a pick tool
[2:39:20] stephcurrysim: if razork doesn't give over his 1k shutdown to akali and lets him kill humanoid too, fnc probably win this game
[2:39:21] themickbeingcarried: NRG jungle gapped G2 @Veila24 bad luck smh
[2:39:25] DazyLave: @PinnxelGRP when the LCK caster shows the mouse cursor to highlight very bad plays and builds Kreygasm
[2:39:34] Mykah9: k'sante is a from of targeted picking for a pick comp
[2:39:38] that_guy_who_games: Ksante is more of followup. Zac is a great example of primary engage ;)
[2:39:38] nickis211: Is Lee sin primary engage?
[2:39:43] najafan: Petition to change cristoLCS to cristoLEC.
[2:39:45] EvolutionWar: Ksante is pick killer not engange
[2:40:03] lkdrama15: @nickis211 no same as ksante
[2:40:05] DazyLave: @nickis211 it is when Oner plays it
[2:40:05] Mykah9: Lee sin is a form of pic comp more so
[2:40:13] danielmp_02: this tf is clean by mad
[2:40:17] TheFissk: Naut can be primary engage but you have to draft him a dive buddy
[2:40:18] PinnxelGRP: They have great engage Monte idk what youre talking about Jinx has flash traps, Brand has flash E Q, Orianna has flash ult. theyre literally engage champs
[2:40:26] uNiq_qontroL: This series is just FNC falling for the same flank about 20 times
[2:40:27] nautcholibre: that‚Äôs why Malf is so good in low elo
[2:40:35] archie7497: @montecristo btw razork flash Senna ult not braum ult at the dragon fight. He completely trolled his flash
[2:40:51] TastyAMG: TastyAMG subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Razork cristoCAKE

[2:41:45] fettucinis: just noticed the zaddy tag
[2:41:54] TastyAMG: @najafan ah shit you're right
[2:41:59] danielmp_02: myrwn tomorrow will clap BB
[2:42:01] lkdrama15: nice how fanatic walks in a line so braum hit multi r
[2:42:03] yanya7701: Gayge
[2:42:04] leamfor: AINTNOYWAY
[2:42:05] TastyAMG: This is true
[2:42:16] Mykah9: so what your saying is myrwn could have been a decent midlaner @MonteCristo ?
[2:42:30] ProdigalChicken: cristoYORD
[2:42:36] leamfor: Marvin is unironically best top.
[2:42:38] that_guy_who_games: Bro these games are simply there to distract from how much of a BANGER Monty is. Man was chiseled from the finest flesh
[2:42:38] TastyAMG: wouldn't surprise me
[2:42:38] PinnxelGRP: you know myrwn looks like a really promising talent
[2:42:39] myosotismenot: montecristo my favorite dilfgamer
[2:42:41] leamfor: Might?
[2:42:48] TheBasedTaka: unrelated but sumday is teamless?
[2:42:53] zacharypaulk: Role swap inc
[2:43:00] lkdrama15: @Mykah9 no he could sometime be a wunder like toplayner
[2:43:01] najafan: @that_guy_who_games Bangers Only refers to Monte, not the games
[2:43:03] zonexinn: did you saw freskowy gragas vs fnatic?
[2:43:08] DazyLave: Grippo's bbq chips are the best
[2:43:15] themickbeingcarried: @MonteCristo If you could replace an LEC botlane with Crownie/Trymbi, who's getting the axe?
[2:43:16] ProdigalChicken: Melzhet Stare
[2:43:27] zacharypaulk: zacharypaulk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:43:52] danielmp_02: Fress 3 MVPs in a row GX VIT AND FNATIC so maybe is not that bad!
[2:43:55] PinnxelGRP: oh I remember the gragas PepeLaugh
[2:43:56] zonexinn: you will enjoy freskowy nexts games trust me
[2:44:05] DazyLave: @zonexinn we only on game 2 draft now
[2:44:29] Professional_Aellith: Dumb question and not super relevant, but who is the Koi is Mad Lions Koi?
[2:44:33] Mykah9: Someone put myrwn under caps training camp and lets see if he become the junior caps....
[2:44:51] TastyAMG: Salty runback? Pog
[2:44:53] r1vah: salty runback
[2:44:56] cooleng: @montecristo I feel like I should be watching more of your bangers only live when I can. the viewing experience is more fun and analytical, also informative and fun imo so far. also your power ranking video was great, even if I disagree with some of it. thanks for the great content snd LFN amazing podcasts claireEhhh
[2:45:09] najafan: Maokai goes SO HARD here.
[2:45:10] najafan: jfc
[2:45:20] Phaetox: Chovy should never play karma again
[2:45:20] dasdummtier: @MonteCristo  who is the goat jungler and why is it peanut?
[2:45:25] lkdrama15: @Mykah9 i think eu don't needs mids they need better tops
[2:45:48] najafan: Maokai slaps
[2:45:52] leamfor: @dasdummtier Peanut World Championship where?
[2:45:57] Phaetox: Yeah gotta ban maokai if you want karma
[2:45:57] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:46:00] zen__cloud: do you think maokai has the best kit in the game?
[2:46:15] najafan: @zen__cloud He slices, he dices, he does it all.
[2:46:18] dasdummtier: @leamfor 2024
[2:46:26] EvolutionWar: Eu toplaners and adc level is really bad
[2:46:51] leamfor: @dasdummtier Kappa
[2:46:55] najafan: Nami
[2:46:55] PinnxelGRP: Humanoid is a great competitor and his anger issues are a result of that
[2:46:58] Mykah9: I think LEC needs a better understanding of champs according to MTG colors so they can do better drafts
[2:46:58] najafan: Slam Nami
[2:47:01] najafan: Nami now
[2:47:03] Stormserpent101: @EvolutionWar idk BB Myrwn irrelevant and Adam are kind of good
[2:47:13] lkdrama15: @leamfor yes ofc zeka will bring it to him
[2:47:15] najafan: Fine
[2:47:17] najafan: Whatever.
[2:47:18] cooleng: @montecristo what‚Äôs your least favourite content to make? I‚Äôm more wondering the logistics of making such content, or the topic or the timing to make it sometimes, just curious. also your favourite content to make
[2:47:24] zen__cloud: @najafan it's great how many builds you can play with him too
[2:47:29] TastyAMG: @najafan isn't Milio just better?
[2:47:42] najafan: @TastyAMG Was talking about red side.
[2:47:47] TastyAMG: oh fair
[2:47:54] najafan: And, no, they do different things.
[2:47:58] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 zeka gets worlds buff and counteracts peanut worlds nerf
[2:47:58] lkdrama15: @Stormserpent101 no eu worst role last year at worlds was top
[2:47:59] najafan: Milio is often better.
[2:48:05] najafan: But it depends on the comp.
[2:48:05] EvolutionWar: @Stormserpent101 compared to what, compare them to any other region and you realize how bad they are stats and results wise
[2:48:05] Phaetox: Would've flexed karma to support and take new mid pick
[2:48:19] TastyAMG: banjot2NOTED
[2:48:34] Phaetox: Maybe sylas
[2:48:41] ABigStarburst: @Phaetox unfortunately we saw Jun's Karma later this series
[2:48:58] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier yes but then zeka is mid tier and you have doran the choker in top
[2:49:08] Stormserpent101: @Stormserpent101 i don't think worlds 2023 is currently running
[2:49:10] DazyLave: weird because Elyoya didn't appear that good on brand when he played it previously
[2:49:17] themickbeingcarried: @MonteCristo what happened to the Talia picks? It seemed so strong before.
[2:49:19] nickis211: Where's the engage from blue side? Karma RE?
[2:49:38] a134n31o43n135: @MonteCristo were you ever high elo in league?
[2:49:48] TastyAMG: it doesn't seem that good
[2:49:55] leamfor: YEP
[2:49:58] DazyLave: Humanoid does have a nasty karma though
[2:50:12] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 nah man Doran smashes Zeus so thats t1 gone, GENG will destruct in quarters like always
[2:50:15] Phaetox: Need Karma Hecarim
[2:50:15] PinnxelGRP: Karma flash tether is great engage idk what youre talking about
[2:50:20] Mykah9: is playing leona or thresh that bad?
[2:50:32] themickbeingcarried: Especially on Fnatic where we know Razork is a serious threat to flex Talia jungle.
[2:50:32] leamfor: @Mykah9 Yes
[2:50:34] hibbjibb: Oh hey it's LEC finalists MAD Lions KOI
[2:50:43] najafan: @Mykah9 Depends on the context.
[2:50:53] Fluffieface: In this case, does bangers only apply to banging our head against a wall because the gameplay is dogshit?
[2:50:55] PinnxelGRP: soon to be LEC champions MAD Lions KOI
[2:50:57] EvolutionWar: just sayin @Stormserpent101 I dont even think they are necessarily better than NA's "best" toplaners, that is horrifying to think about
[2:50:57] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:51:07] cooleng: @montecristo your fantasy list of matchups you wish to see in MSI?
[2:51:10] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier did you see doran last year vs blg he e over a wall and then f back. doran is a choker
[2:51:16] Kodord: he sounds like a monte sub
[2:51:20] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 he solo lost 2 games
[2:51:45] Terrasmith: how do you pick three casters and an adc with one half tank and no peel
[2:51:57] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 they lost those games in draft, now we have TOM the draft god
[2:52:10] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 also this year he smashet nothing on eus
[2:52:20] cooleng: does anyone know if MAD is now confirmed to be in msi?
[2:52:20] Stormserpent101: @EvolutionWar Nah last year they were dog I agree but I think they're on par with NA's current best tops.
[2:52:27] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier no they just choked
[2:52:30] DazyLave: surely Clueless
[2:52:32] najafan: Dive a blitz, KEKW
[2:52:38] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 like last time whit ruler
[2:53:22] DazyLave: I wanna hear the comms there
[2:53:26] Prepo9: Alvaro flashed on to Jun too early
[2:53:26] PinnxelGRP: hook went on milio
[2:53:27] leamfor: jun
[2:53:27] Stormserpent101: i does feel hard to rate any non G2 LEC player highly though when the region as a whole is playing pretty poorly
[2:53:36] najafan: He hooks Milio
[2:53:36] Terrasmith: blitz thought jun took aggro. If he'd flashed on the right target it wouldn't have worked at all
[2:54:12] saberaxe: He flash e's after jun has a AA animation
[2:54:14] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 come on, you cant tell me that GENG doesn't win that if they have a better read on the meta, just like worlds 2022
[2:54:27] EvolutionWar: @Stormserpent101 true, but we are comparing eggs here from na and eu with actual chickens laying eggs in korea and china xD
[2:54:32] saberaxe: the brand e / passive to passive
[2:54:39] saberaxe: took aggro
[2:54:49] DazyLave: people getting jumpy under the dive. Check Oscarinin Ornn as well
[2:54:49] PinnxelGRP: im assuming Jun messed up
[2:55:00] najafan: Comedy of errors
[2:55:02] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier man if you say this then you can say it on t1 or you say it on g2 2019 or you say it on what ever team
[2:55:23] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 doran choked every worlds he was ever
[2:55:23] najafan: In normal circumstances that dive should have been disastrous.
[2:55:27] Redvlurpee: new meta misplay to get the other guy to fail
[2:55:41] TastyAMG: Alright i gotta go to sleep gn Monte and chat Bedge
[2:55:47] DazyLave: peepoBye
[2:55:48] TheFissk: Obviously Alvaro's mistake was assuming he against good players
[2:55:50] Fluffieface: it would be hidsight bias to say it was a good dive
[2:55:53] Prepo9: I feel like Keria would've read that situation way different than Alvaro. Keria is soooo good at knowing who has aggro
[2:55:54] Stormserpent101: @Stormserpent101 Oh absolutely but I like these conversations because I still like interregional rivalries like NA and EU. otherwise why watch these regions at all
[2:56:15] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 just you wait, 2024 peanut will be the undisputed jungle goat

[2:57:08] Phaetox: Wait until there's an all Welsh team with no vowels at all
[2:57:08] EvolutionWar: @Stormserpent101 ofc we still hope someone from the west can compete with the best from the east since Wunder
[2:57:09] cooleng: @montecristo is MAD confirmed to be in msi now after their win against bds today?
[2:57:22] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier guy he is not even top 3 at the moment it is 1 cuzz than canyon and then oner
[2:57:34] Stormserpent101: @cooleng no they have to beat G2 first

[2:58:04] themickbeingcarried: heh

[2:58:26] cooleng: wait I‚Äôm dumb‚Ä¶why am I thinking msi is like around the corner wth? lol
[2:58:32] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 and this is only lck not even lpl
[2:58:35] EvolutionWar: why are we still playing best of 1's in the west btw, are we morons?
[2:58:37] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 are you talking all time? All 3 of those don't have 10 years at the top like peanut
[2:58:40] DazyLave: @cooleng because EU is weird and has 3 splits
[2:58:44] AnonymousNihilist: @cooleng top 2 from lck and lpl, top 1 from lcs lec
[2:58:44] Clyde1500: RaccAttack Clap
[2:58:46] Stormserpent101: @Stormserpent101 Prayge Sniper and Myrwn become the western top goats
[2:58:51] mrkatsudonnn: I think teams are throwing the series against MAD. They are not even good lol
[2:58:51] PresidentNathan: we are just on game two lol

[2:59:24] EvolutionWar: THIS IS NOT PEAK LEAGUE OF LEGENDS AND ITS NOT FROM EUROPE! xD
[2:59:26] nautcholibre: @montecristo do you think the upcoming Kasante changes will make him less pro viable I am tired of seeing him.
[2:59:30] cooleng: @anonymousnihilist is that same as last year or different? I swear it was top two from all major regions not just eastern regions
[2:59:42] PinnxelGRP: Ta
[2:59:50] kiiwiidubu: i hope the meta gets flipped on its head for msi

[3:00:46] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh
[3:00:48] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 i mean is a bit soon to tell, we know how Oner looks without Faker. Sure right now he is not at the top but its more about all time for me
[3:00:57] frostyfury09: watching these games makes me feel like NA is better
[3:01:28] EvolutionWar: watching any game from na or eu makes me feel LPL or LCK is better xD

[3:01:35] Stormserpent101: @frostyfury09 on average yes but G2 clears us as of now
[3:01:36] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier he said peanut will be the best 2024 and right now he is not even top 3
[3:01:44] killerwhalekj: Na is better if u exclude g2
[3:01:44] Lyger009: FeelsOkayMan time for the 1.5x speed
[3:01:47] frostyfury09: @Stormserpent101 easy agree
[3:01:58] Prepo9: Who is supposed to do damage for MDK in that fight???
[3:02:11] AnonymousNihilist: @frostyfury09 seriously though, this game is tough to watch, this is how I felt watching LCS last year
[3:02:27] cooleng: @montecristo your top 5 teams you enjoy watching this year so far, from around the globe?
[3:02:35] najafan: No, what on earth is this nonsense on the cast.
[3:02:36] Evan_Ralston: NOPERS
[3:02:37] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier and even if peanut wins worlds 2024 he is still behind canyon
[3:02:41] EvolutionWar: @AnonymousNihilist And now its LEC the bottom regions xD
[3:02:42] 123hexor: keep watching :)
[3:02:45] najafan: Perfect game is a well defined term.
[3:02:56] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh totally worth 5 games

[3:03:13] AnonymousNihilist: Shopify Rebellion robbd
[3:03:14] PinnxelGRP: He said favorite teams to watch monte not favorite eastern teams to watch
[3:03:15] nautcholibre: we can watch kasante cristoYORD

[3:03:21] najafan: We define NEW terms to talk about new objectives.
[3:03:27] cooleng: sick! I enjoy watching blg and T1
[3:03:30] najafan: Such as immaculate games, or platonic games.
[3:03:39] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 no I said peanut will cement his role as the goat jungler this year. He was better than Oner in 2023 and Oner won worlds. But all time he is already the best for me. Who else are you taking? Blank??
[3:03:46] PinnxelGRP: im a bit of a KC enthusiast
[3:03:49] CrazyPoorer: would you say your favorite teams to watch are also your strongest teams right now in this meta?
[3:03:51] najafan: smh, these people need to get up to date with this discussion.
[3:03:58] Meduhpg: @dasdummtier LOLLLLLLLLLLLLL
[3:04:03] Prepo9: cristoLCS cristoRACCOON  YUMMY TRASH
[3:04:07] AnonymousNihilist: I feel like GenG has been really boring to watch though, I prefer KT
[3:04:08] cooleng: @montecristo your fav 5 champions to see in this meta and your least 5 favourite champions
[3:04:09] PresidentNathan: yeah this series is so bad
[3:04:11] nautcholibre: cristoRACCOON
[3:04:15] Krethas: Honestly, save your time...and ours too

[3:04:23] najafan: No analysis to be done here.
[3:04:25] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 canyons era was 3 years of be the best jungler in the world without any doubt
[3:04:33] kitkatbar5: Kitkat? :)
[3:04:38] The_LostProphet: Sponsor money!
[3:04:40] zen__cloud: you mean they have the pauses because they're shortstaffed :)
[3:04:45] kerokerogrips: are the mad lions rookies really good , or has the rest of the league stagnated/ declined , or a combo of both
[3:04:49] zlrenyth: do they pause because kitkat wants their value Susge ?
[3:04:58] Nnn111199: your favorite team to watch but u choose one from each season?
[3:05:15] awoogawooogawoo: firing those production engineers is really worth it
[3:05:18] MissingMatter: @zlrenyth Are they caving to pressure from Big Kat?
[3:05:26] AnonymousNihilist: @kerokerogrips mostly the league is looking worse
[3:05:27] fullmoon211: i really wished LFN would be able to have costreaming rights and be able to have you, thorin, and rotating guest. imagine havign monte doa blast from the past costreaming edition
[3:05:33] Stormserpent101: @kerokerogrips Both. but Myrwn and Alvaro are really legit
[3:05:48] nautcholibre: would you ever consider doing patch reviews and how it might impact pro play ?
[3:05:50] najafan: "Secure"
[3:05:59] DazyLave: @kerokerogrips some seem to have declined but players like Myrwn, Alvaro as well as Irrelevant on SK are looking very promising
[3:06:00] frostyfury09: do you think the west will do anything at msi from what you've seen so far this year?
[3:06:13] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips I think this is the correct take , seeing all the lec games
[3:06:30] nickis211: How long has the top bar been bugged? I don't think it was bugged for today's game, it looks like garbage rn
[3:06:30] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:06:35] cooleng: @montecristo would you be able to live watch lck or lpl games with Thorin and doa? iirc you said you couldn‚Äôt get co streaming rights for LFN sadly
[3:06:37] jerckysminion: let's go
[3:06:53] Prepo9: @kerokerogrips Myrwn and Alvaro are both good. The core of MDK and their coach has worked together before so there is pre-existing synergy which is going to help A LOT in a short split like this
[3:06:59] QuackTheDuck: Why isnt Adam playing? Isnt he their best player?
[3:07:00] MissingMatter: Being way ahead is OP as it turns out.
[3:07:08] jerckysminion: @cooleng cool concept though
[3:07:15] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 can say the same about peanut ( Koo era) also has longetivity and stability ahead of canyon. Also head to head peanut is better
[3:07:21] cooleng: that would be sick tbh
[3:07:27] EvolutionWar: TSMTSM
[3:07:27] DazyLave: Thorin on live game would be great
[3:07:28] HjorthScrublord: are they chanting tsm? xdd
[3:07:30] CrazyPoorer: would you say your favorite teams to watch are also your strongest teams right now in this meta?
[3:07:30] jerckysminion: mayby something like this for LCK finals or something would be great
[3:07:32] EvolutionWar: TSM xD
[3:07:35] cooleng: cuz I know thorin would go off lol
[3:07:36] awoogawooogawoo: you and thorin in iwd nutsack would be pretty wild
[3:07:39] riz1washere: i think they are chanting USA
[3:07:45] fullmoon211: @troll754 yes!
[3:07:46] riz1washere: xdd
[3:07:51] jerckysminion: yeah
[3:07:57] AnonymousNihilist: how would you rate oscarinin out of all the LEC tops?
[3:08:00] jerckysminion: and they were great :)
[3:08:03] cooleng: maybe watch party for LEC finals and lcs finals
[3:08:04] najafan: Breaking Point LUL
[3:08:05] Shimmerz: the Drx live watch was peak casters couch
[3:08:07] themickbeingcarried: @QuackTheDuck He screamed at his coach and flamed his team in meetings so he was benched. Should have never came ADAM like that.
[3:08:09] themickbeingcarried: heh
[3:08:10] mrkatsudonnn: watch lpl because Thorin love LPL
[3:08:14] Naxser: but normally for internatonal events
[3:08:19] Shimmerz: it‚Äôs where I got to know proxy wolf and his love of hair
[3:08:21] cooleng: yes watch parties not live watches mb lol my brain farted
[3:08:30] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier no canyon almost solo won the worlds series 2022 whit his kayn also he was last year the only reason dk was in worls
[3:08:44] nautcholibre: @montecristo What it‚Äôs gonna take to make Kasante not the go to toplaner in pro. Is he just to good like a Rene that pros will always pick him?
[3:09:02] AnonymousNihilist: @dasdummtier it was definitely him and showmaker 2v8 at points
[3:09:19] cooleng: @montecristo ngl I‚Äôd pay PPV for you and thorin to watch party lck finals and lpl finals and lcs finals
[3:09:34] DazyLave: Ryze Sadge
[3:09:44] UpYerArs: ksante is actually the modern day Ryze it makes so much sense now lmao
[3:09:47] Phaetox: Need more Shen picks. It's a mega ksante counter. Imagine Kiin on Shen ulting chovy azir in fights
[3:09:51] nautcholibre: That makes sense.
[3:09:52] awoogawooogawoo: esportsbet already did with thorin on esl katowice
[3:09:52] cooleng: sickkkkk
[3:10:06] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 peanut had bad years on team dynamic and lgd so no he is not the best
[3:10:08] jerckysminion: @troll754 yup
[3:10:11] Naxser: @MonteCristo Another T1 vs Gen.G final?
[3:10:14] themickbeingcarried: @MonteCristo I'd PPV you guys watching Reginald vods
[3:10:17] Stormserpent101: @Phaetox Bwipo said nasus was also a mega counter even if it is a meme pick
[3:10:20] DazyLave: Imagine Kiin of Chovy on Ksante. They would just Ksante all over those guys'
[3:10:26] DazyLave: or*
[3:10:38] Prepo9: Why are they pronouncing Myrwn name differently every time I hear it
[3:10:39] cooleng: @montecristo you‚Äôll give me a reason to take time off from work and watch in the middle of night in EST timezone like my uni days during OGN Legion nights
[3:10:50] Phaetox: Nasus does actually beat him but much harder to use in pro play comps lol
[3:10:50] jerckysminion: Nasus is a meme pick for most people but there are people who can pull it off cause of their playstyle
[3:10:54] cooleng: good times tbh
[3:11:06] Phaetox: I am a Nasus simp
[3:11:19] 1davidj: they're trying to reduce ksante's projailing a bit by reducing the speed/reliabilty of his combos which i think can help lower the pro/soloq gap
[3:11:36] Stormserpent101: @Phaetox i remember last year when Kayle was op in LPL RA cube pulled it out and 1v9'd the game

[3:12:40] Phaetox: Shen actually OP though I promise you. Follow the way of xPetu sensei
[3:12:40] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 i am sorry but taking canyon all time over peanut is just recency bias. Sure if canyon plays a few more years and evolves to a shotcaller likea peanut and peanut does not win worlds then I agree. But right now I think peanut is still ahead
[3:13:20] lkdrama15: @dasdummtier canyon had not 1 time a losing record
[3:13:45] nautcholibre: i think shen is better for solo a then pro
[3:13:46] Phaetox: Peanut has become a good shot caller but he's always been choker. Hot take I'd take MVP Beyond or AHQ Mountain over Peanut
[3:14:31] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 peanut had it on lgd and geng. also every jungler talks about how peak canyon. noone talks about peak peanute
[3:14:36] nautcholibre: cause it‚Äôs easier to play around his R in pro. in solo Q people forget and take bad fights and you just R them and turn it

[3:15:11] iBlazze: cristoLCS cristoRACCOON cristoRACCOON
[3:15:45] Phaetox: Who are draft coaches for these teams
[3:15:49] lkdrama15: @lkdrama15 its like faker you say it because of the peak a player had and not only beacuse he is a good shotcaller.  i dont say peanut is bad but he had never the peak canyon had
[3:15:54] Phaetox: We need to send trucks
[3:16:13] mrkatsudonnn: The disrespect on Peanut is insane. Peanut make Kellin and Deokdam looks like top tier pllayers
[3:17:03] fIuffee: Do you think that players that are balding should be forced to shave their heads to be allowed on stage?

[3:17:11] cooleng: @montecristo just the optics from the outside look horrific for Adam for his future career prospects and not so great for BDS either, either way frankly. just so strange how it became public knowledge tbh
[3:17:25] jerckysminion: @fIuffee that or the monk cut should be enforced !
[3:17:37] jerckysminion: mayby a saitama cosplayer enforcement also is needed LUL
[3:17:59] arielleej: oh god is this why varrus top is a thing now in solo?
[3:18:05] wubbzk: monte did i miss hle picking azir into geng after zika balling on akali the other day?
[3:18:17] DazyLave: varus top was around last year as well
[3:18:22] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 sure canyon has the higher peak, but skill wise peanut was always better. Just look at thear head-to-head. Faker gets huge credit for leading t1 but peanut also evolved into something creater
[3:18:22] Professional_Aellith: Oh man, I thought this game was a fever dream. I didn‚Äôt realize it actually happened.
[3:18:27] CrazyPoorer: would you say your favorite teams to watch are also your strongest teams right now in this meta?
[3:18:28] jerckysminion: varus top on hit build
[3:18:32] kerokerogrips: at least it was reported to the public , much to the dismay of  spineless LEC Wooloo
[3:18:37] Phaetox: Top varus sounds troll af

[3:19:47] jerckysminion: banger*
[3:20:13] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 and if we talk peak then blank is ahead of canyon but nobody would say blank is the goat jungler
[3:20:23] cooleng: @montecristo what‚Äôs your fav 5 champions to play in league of legends? yourself, not to see in esports games
[3:20:24] nickis211: I didn't know stupid fight from urf carried over to pro games

[3:21:33] Shimmerz: for thorin, it‚Äôs pyke, pyke, pyke, pyke, and pyke

[3:22:39] dasdummtier: @pw479 no, sadly not. Think he went into team managment
[3:22:45] srysorry: Monte im curious why you dont think domwon will bounce back?
[3:22:45] jerckysminion: they normally dispose of things like gallbladder

[3:23:05] cooleng: @montecristo feel free to not answer this: your 5 fav analysts or colour casters globally
[3:23:14] Shimmerz: reksai steals all the kills with her ult but is never tanky enough to be worth in skirmish

[3:23:27] dasdummtier: @lkdrama15 true, but gotta support my guy :D
[3:23:30] Phaetox: He was reincarnated as envy
[3:23:36] madiiiman: silly ohq inting in the enemy base and making the game take 5 more min
[3:23:55] kerokerogrips: has inting lost its meaning when  the people accused of it arent doing it with intent?
[3:23:58] zen__cloud: frosskowy does some insane flanks this game
[3:24:23] DazyLave: @kerokerogrips yes even to the point that dom says "inting on purpose"
[3:24:26] jerckysminion: just keep snowballing
[3:24:34] jerckysminion: mad lions really doing good this season
[3:24:39] Phaetox: Gragas good for setting up isolated targets for kaisa too. Would be nice with a ksante or khazix too
[3:24:41] Lyger009: 3-0 at lvl 1 sure helps
[3:24:45] meeechow: Bot also had good timings to push and get Alvaro free to roam so Kai'sa can play safe

[3:33:10] neilaith: kek
[3:33:13] josefino10: caedrel coestreaming xdd
[3:33:14] Phaetox: KT is supposed to be razorcake but now they actually look like razors... but so far taste like cake... it's very fraud alert vibes
[3:33:15] humanpanda22: yes
[3:33:15] awoogawooogawoo: caedrel casting 5Head caedrel costream xdd

[3:33:30] neilaith: good man, always back yourself
[3:33:33] jerckysminion: papasmithy always was lovely to listen to also
[3:33:38] halojib: TRUE
[3:33:40] meeechow: You are the OG Goat of casting. Legit why I got into watching Competitive LoL
[3:33:41] Phaetox: Monte doa best duo
[3:33:43] crazy5155: You and Doa best casters ever
[3:33:45] wubbzk: that wolf guy is alright
[3:33:47] nautcholibre: he misspoke guys he means DOA .
[3:33:51] dasdummtier: analyst desk monte is clear of caster monte
[3:33:52] awoogawooogawoo: but captainflowers can talk fast you cannot
[3:33:56] awoogawooogawoo: xdd
[3:33:57] eric101101101101: phreak monte best casting duo actually
[3:34:11] jerckysminion: in b4 someone says joe miller
[3:34:13] UpYerArs: @UpYerArs little do you know this is my step one to financial freedom. believe in kt enough then put the house on BRO vs KT
[3:34:17] cooleng: @montecristo if MAD wins against G2, what‚Äôs the narrative you think? LEC is weak, or EU has sleeper talents? bad team managers creating team formations that make no sense or the old guards are hanging on too long?
[3:34:18] wrathoffaust1: I miss LS casting days with Atlus and Valdes
[3:34:18] Phaetox: You co casting with jatt and kobe even made them tolerable
[3:34:42] uNiq_qontroL: MDK actually looked genuinely good, but I think that speaks a lot on FNCs inability to mark the flanker
[3:34:49] Phaetox: Agreed on LS
[3:34:53] awoogawooogawoo: ls casting is about pokemon and dragonball
[3:34:54] najafan: LS's costreaming varies.
[3:34:59] najafan: Some days are very good.
[3:34:59] Terrasmith: LS is very unfiltered on costream and it's much more fun
[3:35:02] QUOTE_IF_SIGMA: too many twitch memes from caedrel :)
[3:35:02] neilaith: tru LS needs to be free from corporate guides to be fire
[3:35:05] najafan: Some days are very very boring.
[3:35:10] QUOTE_IF_SIGMA: feels like I'm watching collective twitch chat
[3:35:11] suprimo114: i liked caedrel casting but i can't watch his costreams
[3:35:12] burdil3z: razork holds brand the entire series and when he picks other champ the team synergy fall
[3:35:14] Phaetox: But his volume is too all over the place
[3:35:21] looknonumbers: when he loses interest in the games he kinda completely checks out is my only issue
[3:35:26] Itsifi: best Monte is EMOnte
[3:35:37] crazy5155: I mean Captain Flowers makes LCS ok
[3:35:50] jerckysminion: WHAT
[3:35:52] awoogawooogawoo: could flakked be an upgrade than supa?
[3:35:56] isJolTz: hiihi
[3:36:10] qirei: krepo and deficio were kinda goated casters to
[3:36:11] bigpapa421: noah has been fnatics best player last 3 series
[3:36:28] cooleng: @montecristo IWD got co streaming rights, would you ever do a watch party with him in the future maybe? I‚Äôd love to see that personally
[3:36:29] Shimmerz: it was memeworthy
[3:36:29] shaleleles: @MonteCristo How is it raising a kid so far in korea anything that you didnt expected?
[3:36:31] awoogawooogawoo: LS just invite wack guest in his costream
[3:36:32] crazy5155: Deficio and Quickshot made EU awesome
[3:36:48] UpYerArs: medic almost said Chupa xdd
[3:36:48] dasdummtier: @qirei the kruggs rants where so fun
[3:37:07] Shimmerz: the sinners analogy was peak LS
[3:37:12] nickis211: Riot don't think so with worlds xdd
[3:37:13] neilaith: the kruggers
[3:37:14] Elysian_Shine: the item discussions got a little much by the end of his casting career imo
[3:37:20] xonsa: @crazy5155 not deman or joe miller?
[3:37:24] Kryvo: mfw your 4/0/2 but still 400 gp behind aware
[3:37:24] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:37:27] awoogawooogawoo: morellicon vs liandries xdd
[3:37:27] Terrasmith: That makes a lot of sense
[3:37:35] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Dose ivren still gets less gold from camp like crugs
[3:37:35] isJolTz: LS is very game focused, optimal play and detail. much less about the players individually. The scene has a lot of people like Monte/Dom who are good about the flavor and storylines
[3:37:36] Dragonslave49: only cocasters I ever found tolerable were Montecristo, Doa, and IWD
[3:37:43] nickis211: Riot thinks three NA casters can embody the CN vs KR storyline xdd
[3:37:50] suprimo114: papa was really good with the narratives
[3:37:54] najafan: Sure, but on his costreams sometimes he'll just stop talking about the game and will start talking about his family, or random stuff about life in Korea, or just anecdotes with the other people in the costream that only those 3 people get.
[3:37:59] wrathoffaust1: Reason i liked LS casting is prolly because i generally prefer coastreams over official casts
[3:38:11] crazy5155: @xonsa I started watching league in season 4 and only NA stuff
[3:38:12] najafan: And for like those people that dig that, sure.
[3:38:13] rilsolo: it was like his 2nd stream
[3:38:14] DazyLave: it was the aatrox pronunciations for me
[3:38:23] Zonguy: that‚Äôs very true
[3:38:28] fIuffee: I always disliked his casts and I wasn't sure why but you've just explained why
[3:38:37] cooleng: @montecristo besides you and DoA as the goats in League esports, your top 3 fav duo casters historically?
[3:38:47] najafan: But I'm there for the league theory. Which became more hit and miss over the years.
[3:38:55] Shimmerz: cadrel swearing in the Drx final was funny
[3:38:57] dasdummtier: lck had some great casting talent over the years, crazy how consistend it always was
[3:38:58] awoogawooogawoo: xdd
[3:39:03] Adanion: manic energy
[3:39:04] Zonguy: as someone who worked in nba broadcasting, there‚Äôs a reason bob costas is top even tho he doesn‚Äôt appeal for a podcast
[3:39:07] awoogawooogawoo: xdding
[3:39:10] RhinoTheHamster: it became the LSCU
[3:39:11] VanidarD: I cant watch caedrels costream, its just screaming I dont get it
[3:39:18] irrelevant_ow: xdd
[3:39:19] death_kain: death_kain subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:39:21] burdil3z: I think the best moment was when krepo b2b monte at worlds finals
[3:39:21] neilaith: xdd
[3:39:25] DazyLave: caedrel literally cosplaying xdd
[3:39:25] Mizzzraim: caedrel is fine but damn his fans are worse than t1 fans
[3:39:27] kerokerogrips: caedrel has the funniest interactions with his chat doe
[3:39:28] Terrasmith: LS and sinners was the new Monte and rotations
[3:39:29] 123hexor: i agree
[3:39:32] isJolTz: Caedrel has the most zoomer ADHD brain stream
[3:39:35] najafan: @VanidarD Same with Dom tbh
[3:39:42] posthumousforgiveness: caedral community is super cringe
[3:39:44] awoogawooogawoo: caedrel is what xqc used to be xdd
[3:39:49] isJolTz: I personally can't watch Caedrel for too long, but he is entertaining
[3:39:52] posthumousforgiveness: but I like caedral
[3:39:58] GillyCG: his costreams are alot better when he is isnt acting like a complete degen
[3:40:07] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: simply: they are all entertaining in their own right
[3:40:09] dasdummtier: @Terrasmith true @MonteCristo  what happened to the rotations ?
[3:40:10] killerwhalekj: His chat is horrible i hate copy pasta spamming
[3:40:11] fIuffee: the golden age of league casting was phreak season 1. sorry but its true
[3:40:13] neilaith: kek
[3:40:16] TilNextTyme: caedrals stream is meant for zoomers, I couldnt do it.
[3:40:18] Phaetox: Caedrel draft analysis is really good too. Or at least his draft predictions
[3:40:19] Zen6: i find i like different costreamers for different times
[3:40:21] VanidarD: @VanidarD nah, I love doms costream, he has actual analysis, of course the LEC streams with the sack are more of a fun attitude, but its still very different imo
[3:40:22] DazyLave: caedrel is mind controlled by his chat
[3:40:25] Terrasmith: @dasdummtier Monte stopped casting, haha
[3:40:30] cooleng: @montecristo besides you and DoA as the goats in League esports, your top 3 fav duo casters historically?
[3:40:32] gorwings: i saw someone commenting on a reaction vod of dom's for an anti-spoiler plant. That's caedrel's thing, but why
[3:40:33] fIuffee: asmongold being so popular is wild to me
[3:40:36] najafan: @dasdummtier They nerfed lane swaps into the ground
[3:40:39] irrelevant_ow: different demographic
[3:40:43] yanya7701: @DazyLave thats what he makes you to think
[3:40:54] posthumousforgiveness: spunj and machine goated
[3:40:56] Terrasmith: @dasdummtier but also riot removed tons of vision and made the game less controlled, so the playstyle changed
[3:40:57] pupkat: @MonteCristo it is just make them feel good about themselves
[3:40:58] cooleng: in league of legends @montecristo
[3:41:04] Shimmerz: atlas wolf is good
[3:41:06] callowlock: too bad ls and c9 didnt work out. the announcement video where he says "mass is on weekends" was peak for me
[3:41:07] fIuffee: how do you feel about medic as a caster? @MonteCristo
[3:41:08] whatsmynamebabygurl: xqcHead
[3:41:09] KFCSaera: @MonteCristo do you feel like LS also suffered in his casting bc he was basically the only analyst?
[3:41:14] CageRC: caedrals draft analysis is insanely good and can tell a history of players and what champs they lean to
[3:41:15] VanidarD: I loved HenryG and Sadokist, those guys were fucking goated
[3:41:22] suprimo114: i liked papa and atlus
[3:41:25] callowlock: callowlock subscribed with Prime. 
[3:41:32] yanya7701: @KFCSaera LS suffered in casting bc what he says is wrong lol
[3:41:34] death_kain: daisy what a champ
[3:41:37] Mizzzraim: LUL
[3:41:37] gorwings: anders/semmler was great back in the day
[3:41:58] Hjarndyr: anders & semmler were the goats til semmler left imo
[3:42:01] najafan: @yanya7701 Maybe you should play MtG more, smh
[3:42:02] maomaostan2: i like lau scrawny, that might be a hot take from what i've seen on HLTV @MonteCristo
[3:42:02] crazy5155: What about Medi and Vedi?
[3:42:08] VanidarD: Sado's downfall was just sad, almost as sad as Carlos'
[3:42:08] gorwings: medi/vedi can be entertaining at times
[3:42:12] DazyLave: I liked Achilios for his time
[3:42:12] makeinsulinfreepls: does anyone remember the kobe and wombat duo from very early league
[3:42:15] yanya7701: @najafan HUH
[3:42:16] arielleej: I remember Thoorin saying that in his interview with Artosis - that developers hate duos because of that reason
[3:42:24] Havocist: The ultimate caster was TotalBiscuit.
[3:42:29] awoogawooogawoo: achilios was so underrated
[3:42:29] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[3:42:39] Phaetox: LS cast did feel like he was always pushing a conspiracy theory while I was trying to watch. His costreams with crownie were funny af though
[3:42:40] Kudegraw: I do love Medi Vedi tho
[3:42:42] fIuffee: how do you feel about medic as a caster?
[3:42:42] callowlock: Flowers/Kobe!?
[3:42:45] Toasturr: Toasturr subscribed with Prime. 
[3:42:48] Nissal: Caedrel and Drakos, Medi and Vedi no?
[3:42:51] najafan: @yanya7701 Outdrafted.
[3:42:52] Terrasmith: I love the logic. "Our casting duo is so popular they have too much negotiating power, so clearly we can't have duos"
[3:42:53] Toasturr: mangoBBF
[3:42:54] stevizzle34: Frodan?
[3:43:04] crazy5155: I prefer Flowers/Azael
[3:43:11] cooleng: @montecristo fml I actually never thought of that till you just said it‚Ä¶.bro wth?! I think you and doa are goatee but there has to be some that are on their way to your throne‚Ä¶and riot botched that , for once, in your favour lmao
[3:43:12] Swirx_: Uber from overwatch is my goat
[3:43:20] DazyLave: Quickshot and Deficio
[3:43:23] posthumousforgiveness: captain flowers is the caedral of casting
[3:43:24] arielleej: which is very different from say r6 - which does have duos by default
[3:43:25] cooleng: goated *
[3:43:28] death_kain: riot makes sure we cant have anything nice
[3:43:30] najafan: #FreeZirene
[3:43:33] CageRC: flowers man‚Ä¶ incredible
[3:43:34] yanya7701: @najafan are you seriously using MTG as a reference of draft smh
[3:43:41] neilaith: gg
[3:43:45] awoogawooogawoo: papasmithy and valdez was the best when you left
[3:43:52] PathosEngine: Leauge not having good duo casters?  It's almost like Riot only likes one sided relationships.
[3:43:58] gorwings: have you noticed the LEC casters have been in nicer suits recently?
[3:44:08] iBlazze: @najafan damn i forgot about zirene, what happened to him lol
[3:44:20] najafan: @yanya7701 Given LS does in a metaphor for champions having themes, and we're discussing whether LS is right, uh, yeah?
[3:44:22] fIuffee: I'd respect monte so much more if he took anabolic steroids
[3:44:22] Avisir: Riot must be very tempted to replace every caster/analyst with Vtubers and own every aspect of the show
[3:44:23] dasdummtier: @iBlazze he overslept :(
[3:44:33] DazyLave: F
[3:44:49] yanya7701: @najafan just bc LS does it doesnt make it not cringe
[3:44:50] najafan: @iBlazze He overslept, got fired, then I think he made guides for a bit on like mobafire or something.
[3:44:54] Nissal: Also Valorant has a good amount of duo casters
[3:44:56] crazy5155: Caster I miss is Riv
[3:45:04] Phaetox: T1 getting ready to stomp FOX
[3:45:11] The_Blaze83: whats your opinion on smolder
[3:45:12] feromortum: @iBlazze He does QA at blizzard for classic WoW
[3:45:13] DazyLave: Riv LuL
[3:45:13] death_kain: i thought the adam drama was going to be more spicy
[3:45:14] Terrasmith: @yanya7701 MtG deck drafting is the same skillset as draft phase of league. It's a decent analogy
[3:45:15] sativa2lol: hi nerds peepoHey
[3:45:19] iBlazze: @najafan damn unlucky
[3:45:22] death_kain: turns out hes just a dick go figure
[3:45:30] notzoombagaming: its a day ending why y so thorin is starting a war
[3:45:44] RhinoTheHamster: Anyone remember the all star show match (CSGO) that was casted by RedEye, Thorin and Richard Lewis?
[3:45:55] awoogawooogawoo: @RhinoTheHamster xdd
[3:45:57] cooleng: @montecristo is there any public knowledge why Quickshot isn‚Äôt casting LEC? I couldn‚Äôt find anything on his Twitter unless I am blind . I liked his casting.
[3:46:02] dasdummtier: think the casting in LoL is fine, what I really miss is the old desks. That was so much more fun back in the day, so many iconic moments
[3:46:02] najafan: @yanya7701 I mean, sure? But your thesis was that it was wrong, so I referenced it as something you should do more to actually build up the knowledge so you could correct your false belief. It may be cringe, but it's still analogical.
[3:46:09] killerwhalekj: Mad needs to work on their macro
[3:46:29] TilNextTyme: the gragas play this game is so good. it just gets better too
[3:46:40] fIuffee: najafan got so bored reading that message you just wrote LOL
[3:46:41] iBlazze: @cooleng someone posted a behind the scene clip of him making a dark humor joke
[3:46:42] awoogawooogawoo: Have you ever cast a cs game?
[3:46:55] DazyLave: Ivern RIOT
[3:47:00] najafan: @cooleng Uh, not sure if Twitch will get annoyed. Something to do with a German historical figure and DJing.
[3:47:06] death_kain: should humanoid have hit naut there?
[3:47:10] Toasturr: huge heal
[3:47:13] cooleng: @iblazze you‚Äôre kidding right? that‚Äôs the reason?
[3:47:14] yanya7701: @najafan its cringe exactly bc it is you who need to build up the knowledge to realize what he says is wrong and thats the irony
[3:47:18] callowlock: ivern op
[3:47:19] fIuffee: austrian historical figure
[3:47:37] Nissal: Yeah he made a certain gesture that is not allowed in Germany or any other place in my opinion

[3:47:55] iBlazze: @cooleng it wasn't outright stated as that being the reason, but it seems to be the reason
[3:47:56] cooleng: @najafan wait what? lol seriously that happened and that‚Äôs why?

[3:48:03] kookoolau: Monte,  BDS needs Adams... otherwise it looks like no soul.... just like T1 has no Faker
[3:48:04] DazyLave: Bomba
[3:48:06] Toasturr: sheesh :o
[3:48:15] fIuffee: @najafan read my last message btw
[3:48:19] death_kain: these 2 guys just having a ls beef with each other in chat lol
[3:48:30] iBlazze: Freeskowy went off in this series
[3:48:30] RhinoTheHamster: @troll754 the map seems to be more t-sided, so is the world
[3:48:38] dasdummtier: gragas is always sucha big game champion
[3:48:53] najafan: @cooleng He made a joke about it and it was somewhat controversial, yes.
[3:49:01] cooleng: kinda feel shitty your employer gets to control your livehood when it‚Äôs not work related and a clip comes out, sure yeah that‚Äôs normal.
[3:49:03] najafan: @fIuffee I'm... Glad?
[3:49:33] najafan: @cooleng tbf, he works in the entertainment industry.
[3:49:52] cooleng: @najafan I see ty for informing me. I am just not aware and kinda disgusted (as usual) by that reasoning
[3:51:17] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo isn't it cool how Myrwn has such a large champ pool as a top laner?
[3:51:44] iBlazze: humanoid also had a shit series imo
[3:51:48] cooleng: @najafan the controversial part you mentioned tells me someone in some capacity was ‚Äútriggered‚Äù or felt they had to do something cuz they wanna preserve such imagery from the public. just another Tuesday for rito.
[3:52:15] uNiq_qontroL: why is no one ever marking him on the flank though?
[3:52:17] KingMangaMan: @MonteCristo Somehow Humanioid didn't flash that Gragas flank even though they saw him on vision the entire time.
[3:52:24] gaussjd: best player in MDK in your opinion? or biggest potential at leastr
[3:52:35] najafan: @cooleng I actually don't know if anyone complained or it was just riot being riot.
[3:53:00] najafan: It was a very mild joke, if somewhat distasteful.
[3:53:00] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:53:25] fIuffee: the idea of hitler being a dj is kinda funny though
[3:53:56] RhinoTheHamster: i don't regularly watch lol but it seems like I haven't seen Thresh played in years am i wrong?
[3:54:04] najafan: LEC does happen to be in Germany though, and they don't mess around with that.
[3:54:09] cooleng: @montecristo sir your flash bang white as a southerner wiki site is fucking my eyes lol  . spare us please with some dark mode lol
[3:54:09] najafan: So I dunno.
[3:54:10] uNiq_qontroL: the fact the LEC is in Berlin of all places means those kind of jokes arent gna fly
[3:54:38] cooleng: @najafan riot being riot is more likely if I had to guess, based on their track record

[4:03:23] Grumahr: xD
[4:03:25] TilNextTyme: oh man im excited for that lmao
[4:03:27] iBlazze: I kinda want a montepuke emote, no kink involved
[4:03:29] Komarimasita: @MonteCristo  I played a norm today and invaded a Vi and all chatted "what is Vi?" and she responded "a turd!"
[4:03:35] signaturr: make sure to throw some wooloo shots
[4:03:35] nautcholibre: Wasn‚Äôt it like season 3 or4 that Zac was a toplaner. what is it about this season that made him a top again? @montecristo
[4:03:42] gosulkk: Oh boy Thoorin will go off, can't wait
[4:03:51] Shimmerz: thorin will get some shots on nuc too at the same time
[4:03:55] cooleng: I can‚Äôt wait for thorin monologue about BDS and Adam. poor thorin he can‚Äôt catch a W even when he compliments his enemy Adam lol
[4:04:00] burdil3z: this game was so good, give the people what they want a 5 game series cristoTSM
[4:04:05] dgonsays: is it released why he missed
[4:04:06] Mizzzraim: humanoid only flashing when hes already doomed
[4:04:11] suprimo114: no way thorin isn't spiteful at all
[4:04:21] goodpostureguy: @dgonsays kicked for toxicity after g2 loss
[4:04:25] uNiq_qontroL: if they just exit same direction they wud both live
[4:04:30] uNiq_qontroL: either direction
[4:04:35] goodpostureguy: @goodpostureguy "benched"
[4:04:52] Avisir: Adam's tweet it's so good it's very obvious he didn't write it
[4:05:44] uNiq_qontroL: theres still 3 turret shots left before he'd get aggro too
[4:05:45] VerbalHorse: @Avisir Tbh he would likely just do more dmg if he wrote his own tweet xD
[4:06:00] zanchu: the minions were almost dead i think
[4:06:15] uNiq_qontroL: minion cud tank 3 more shots, no way he'd get hit
[4:06:44] Terrasmith: even if the minions died there's a full health karma to tank a shot
[4:06:44] zer088: he prolly could flash towards top side JG
[4:07:40] VerbalHorse: Yeah he just goes the wrong way, Fresskowy shouldn't have tried to save him too
[4:08:02] reckless_joins_astralis: angwy manlet uwu
[4:08:36] nautcholibre: I like how this season no Mythic items have made certain champs like Zac playable toplane but idk it feels weird to play lee or Rene without goredrinker.
[4:08:36] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[4:08:59] TilNextTyme: hwei kinda pops off this game if i remember right
[4:09:06] jarethiz: myrwn is a beast ngl
[4:09:12] zanchu: how stupid is zac that he plays that like and gets away with it
[4:09:15] uNiq_qontroL: how does Zac even lane into Gnar, he loses hard in both forms doesnt he
[4:09:31] VerbalHorse: @zanchu one blob healed for like 300-400 hp lol
[4:09:43] nautcholibre: he sits top until he becomes unkillable
[4:10:05] nautcholibre: the healing is nuts
[4:10:44] uNiq_qontroL: did they not expect the renata roam?
[4:10:51] RhinoTheHamster: Zac just farm and listen to House of Pain for a while
[4:10:59] uNiq_qontroL: since the grubs were gone either way
[4:11:07] goodpostureguy: going to watch lck now, have fun!

[4:11:45] TilNextTyme: humanoid pops off
[4:11:50] VanidarD: dont worry monte, the real tragedy is the 5th game
[4:11:55] VanidarD: that one is atrocious
[4:12:05] nautcholibre: Karma is OP cristoDEVIL
[4:12:06] VerbalHorse: They were winning game 5 too until they weren't
[4:12:07] bigpapa421: @MonteCristo thoughts on Juhan going to ERL ?
[4:12:12] zanchu: razork did carried this one I think
[4:13:30] uNiq_qontroL: FNCs comp is actually just so insane against a Karma/Ezreal duo carry comp
[4:13:33] VerbalHorse: LUL
[4:14:12] nautcholibre: I can never tell if grubs are good in SoloQ like sometimes I take them but if my lanes aren‚Äôt hitting tower, dragon ‚Äúfeels‚Äù better.

[4:15:43] hibbjibb: I've really been enjoying the T1 fan comments this year
[4:15:50] bigpapa421: i still think BLG should be like 3rd and some other LPL teams a big high but its pretty good tier list still
[4:15:52] Civiss: btw I knew cloud9 wasn't gonna be on the list. but the preview gave me  0.01% hope LUL
[4:15:58] hibbjibb: They've left a few gems on Power spike
[4:16:00] suprimo114: yea im just really low on lng rn
[4:16:11] aBitTooHircine: I liked them too Monte, but I'm typically part of that majority of content enjoyers that watches but doesnt comment.
[4:16:14] Bestiality_Is_Just_A_Word: For the next power rankings can you reduce the fire crackling sound effect like 30%? Otherwise it was really good.
[4:16:34] reckless_joins_astralis: who wins the bo5 between up and c9?
[4:16:55] Zebrios: oh lawd, Keria Ezreal support...
[4:17:00] trueaether: FLY is going to be such a bad rep for NA Jensen and Busio just don't seem to have the upside
[4:17:14] Civiss: @reckless_joins_astralis has to be C9, UP look sooo bad even for lpl
[4:17:17] Zoht_: C9 can't be on that list as long as fudge is the top laner
[4:17:32] Kirito_VSM: The team I feel bad about is DK man I really wish they would do better
[4:17:41] FuumaX: Keria is insane
[4:17:42] Naxser: @MonteCristo Ezreal support keria
[4:17:46] nautcholibre: I love EU fans they have fun chants!

[4:27:39] MrWooody: what's that razork flash HUH
[4:28:25] FireEatingNinja: Fnatic really working hard to lose this one
[4:28:29] uNiq_qontroL: MDK had so many moments this game that were almost good, but not quite, like Ezreal being JUST in range this time
[4:28:55] fIuffee: phreak reference??
[4:29:23] uNiq_qontroL: he doesnt get Vi ulted here this is so good for MDK

[4:32:00] Rgb14: oscirn did to
[4:32:05] Rgb14: they both flashed same time
[4:32:11] uNiq_qontroL: even if he gets the TP it wudnt do shjt, what a mini gnar even trying to do there
[4:32:27] Neumonyx: good plays - good eye for catching that
[4:34:05] FireEatingNinja: Yeah he saved the game for sure but it's not over depending on how this fight goes
[4:34:16] uNiq_qontroL: imagine Gnar had just kept his flash earlier for this fight
[4:34:34] VerbalHorse: That damage on Ez is crazy tho
[4:35:06] gaussjd: razork was getting all the objective smites, elyoya gotta improve in that
[4:35:07] trollooe: even worse considering he has vi and can just ult on the vi ult
[4:35:16] uNiq_qontroL: this was a good ult no? forces MDK to commit to being in the pit and take the fight, no way out kind of ult
[4:35:23] uNiq_qontroL: altho ''zoning ult'' is a bit of a meme
[4:35:46] hazygreys: or could send it into the pit lol

[4:36:03] uNiq_qontroL: but if he sends it into the pit they can just leave on the river
[4:36:04] Avisir: how are we not engaging as mega gnar with 3 clumped on the redemption?
[4:36:07] nautcholibre: xin doesn‚Äôt block it right  just projectiles?
[4:36:13] zanchu: pretty sure Vi ult is unstoppable
[4:36:20] zanchu: can't be knocked back
[4:37:08] Professional_Aellith: It was a zoning ult, EU mind games. 5D chess.
[4:37:10] hazygreys: and theyre fighting for drag, they aint casually walking out of river
[4:37:45] uNiq_qontroL: on Hwei Varus
[4:37:47] uNiq_qontroL: ouch
[4:37:50] nautcholibre: @montecristo Xin R doesn‚Äôt block Renata R correct ?
[4:37:54] FireEatingNinja: I'm surprised MDK's timing was so bad on baron. They've failed to close at this point
[4:38:03] fIuffee: really glad that fnatic won this game. did not want a finals with the nobodies in mad lions
[4:38:29] trueaether: this is the game you use to sell hwei to your team
[4:39:09] uNiq_qontroL: wait, it blocks Nami wave then?
[4:39:12] FireEatingNinja: @trueaether Yeah poke varus with Hwei looks very oppressive
[4:39:13] uNiq_qontroL: I dont think so right?
[4:39:18] cryowizzzard: why doesn‚Äôt karma go cosmic drive?
[4:39:48] TheFissk: Renata is newer than Xin and therefore the interaction goes in her favour
[4:39:56] Avisir: grouping as 5 with gnar is so bad, he should be splitting
[4:40:21] uNiq_qontroL: shud Zac be out of vision here? Or is he required in the frontline for FNC?
[4:40:35] FireEatingNinja: Fnatic's go button is very strong
[4:40:38] FireEatingNinja: Great pick comp
[4:40:47] nautcholibre: yea cause he R is like a taunt I guess.
[4:40:55] Hide_in_Jungle: Noooo
