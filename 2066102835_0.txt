[1:05:55] Grognog: I think that gives them the edge in a team vs team situation. The scary part of the enemy team is the old skirmish into leads on Vi or illaoi
[1:05:59] PoorMansPoison: Why do I feel like getting azir poked is gonna tilt JP
[1:07:14] PoorMansPoison: Good shit Lazzie

[1:19:39] Percussion1: gotta respect swain in the teamfights
[1:19:52] Percussion1: azir R has to zone him off so the ult runs out
[1:19:53] Fr0stWulf: tough team comp to fight into
[1:20:05] PoorMansPoison: DinkDonk percussion advice
[1:20:07] Swiftfool: Treat swain like gnar or illaoi
[1:20:11] PoorMansPoison: DinkDonk
[1:20:13] jaxkmurphy: this is why I kinda wanted boss man to go hwei instead of azir cause he can’t really azir ult two of them LUL he would just kill his carries
[1:20:18] Oglino: yeh swain ult and illaoi ult are annoying tink
[1:20:20] ToutedDjinn: DinkDonk Swain main has spoken

[1:20:53] Grognog: The old, who can peel the hardest without getting a carry randomly gibbed
[1:21:18] PoorMansPoison: that illaoi swain combo SUCKS
[1:21:22] PoorMansPoison: it hurts so bad

[1:38:10] Swiftfool: Ashe is mostly utility
[1:38:51] PoorMansPoison: I feel like keeping Lazzie ahead is vital to giving enough time to scale
[1:39:07] ToutedDjinn: So far, all games of this part of the tournament has been 21
[1:39:07] Grognog: Was a split comp issue with the noct. Could have been a dive comp with the mao and azir, or a disengage comp with the janna, mao, azir
[1:39:10] ToutedDjinn: 2-1
[1:39:12] moist_heinous: swain made it hard for nocturne to get in
[1:39:19] Grognog: Classic case of could be both, ended up none
[1:39:38] PoorMansPoison: True if picks went better that might have been a very different game
[1:39:57] PoorMansPoison: in teamfights sera is huge
[1:39:59] PoorMansPoison: so idk
[1:40:11] Fr0stWulf: i cant believe you dont get all champs in customs
[1:40:19] Fr0stWulf: what a stupiud ass decision
[1:41:13] Grognog: Could throw in an amumu if they try a similar comp again
[1:41:13] Moobot: Merch is live! Check out all the cool stuff at https://lawlman.com/
[1:41:49] Swiftfool: Owning all champs is pretty imp for support, since supports usually first pick
[1:41:49] ToutedDjinn: sounds like the teams banning the comp from last so
[1:41:51] PoorMansPoison: 2 tank setup was kinda key that first game
[1:42:44] Grognog: Think the mao will get banned this time though

[1:48:33] Swiftfool: my favorite ashe skin
[1:48:39] Drainora: sejuana players are probably the most respectable players NODDERS
[1:48:45] Rejex15: I wish I could dive, servers are busted AFAIK Sadge
[1:48:53] PoorMansPoison: Watch for aggro jungle thing again
[1:49:06] Grognog: A game of, protect the squishy bot lane with big pig, big moma and also that robot spewing lazers everywhere
[1:49:32] Drainora: The Frosty pig rider NODDERS
[1:49:38] moist_heinous: big red button
[1:49:50] RedFacedBeast: hard game for Sejuani as solo frontline for mid/bot lanes.
[1:49:56] Swiftfool: Do they play another match after this?
[1:50:02] thatluckyloser: I thought he was gone for the weekend?
[1:50:07] Percussion1: top and jungle are good matchups so laning should be alright
[1:50:16] CheekyTM: Does viktor not have the rod thing anymore?
[1:50:34] PoorMansPoison: Its just a passive now
[1:50:36] CompulsiveOne: @CheekyTM its just the passive now
[1:50:39] CheekyTM: ah
[1:50:39] Swiftfool: @CheekyTM I guess not, someone said the upgrades are based on creep score or maybe level?
[1:50:41] thatluckyloser: did we win thhe last game?
[1:50:42] CompulsiveOne: a stacking passive
[1:51:02] Swiftfool: What rank is Jelly btw?
[1:51:04] PoorMansPoison: Man this JP guy a little aggro
[1:51:10] Oglino: emerald

[1:52:03] thatluckyloser: bossman can't lose
[1:52:04] Drainora: does veigar counter viktor?
[1:52:18] Grognog: Nah
[1:52:19] PoorMansPoison: Prayge I believe in you Lazzie
[1:52:23] Swiftfool: @Drainora not really just a passive lane
[1:52:40] Drainora: just a farm then roaming lane then
[1:52:47] Grognog: Aye
[1:53:04] Oglino: danse
[1:53:18] Uncertain_Fool: chat you chillin? chillCat
[1:53:30] PoorMansPoison: care lazzie

[1:55:00] thatluckyloser: Prayge
[1:55:03] PoorMansPoison: Prayge
[1:55:04] ToutedDjinn: Prayge
[1:55:06] Grognog: I like their comp a lot more this time. Think if bot survives early mid game theyre golden
[1:55:12] Oglino: Prayge
[1:55:56] PoorMansPoison: this def feels like a much nicer comp
[1:56:38] Swiftfool: Jelly's comp has better teamfight I think, but it should still be playable
[1:56:38] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq
[1:56:45] Percussion1: this comp is much more versatile
[1:57:11] Swiftfool: Yeah their comp is better at teamfight
[1:57:15] PoorMansPoison: Just play safe again
[1:57:20] ToutedDjinn: Gotta play safer NODDERS
[1:57:28] Swiftfool: need to play picks with lux ashe sej ult is the way to go
[1:57:30] jaxkmurphy: awkward mana fight too
[1:57:46] jaxkmurphy: but hey 3 grubs up and no drag taken
[1:57:54] Grognog: @Swiftfool Or disengage, also a solid option with their setup
[1:58:02] thatluckyloser: has he missed any cannons
[1:58:11] PoorMansPoison: Dayum
[1:58:54] PoorMansPoison: I think if they play safe this is their game again
[1:59:01] RedFacedBeast: 10m for first dragon is really good for viktor comp, since outscale
[1:59:02] Drainora: I'm a huge fan of lux support, it also gets that juicy damage NODDERS most of the time
[1:59:25] Swiftfool: Lux support is good if u can combo with it, I think its better with champs like cait
[2:00:16] Swiftfool: I think their biggest issue will be a lack of dmg unless viktor gets online
[2:00:24] Grognog: Eyup
[2:00:29] PoorMansPoison: I like this game way better since lazzie isn't shoved too
[2:00:53] ToutedDjinn: NODDERS So far looking like a slower game
[2:00:57] RedFacedBeast: Viktor is going to be online. I think biggest issue is no defense buttons in bot lane. eventually ashe/lux just get 1tapped by everything on enemy team.
[2:01:02] Grognog: Though its very fight dependant. A lot of damage could come from illaoi if they make the classic mistake of fighting on her ult
[2:01:12] thatluckyloser: oof
[2:01:21] Good_Old_Heretic: is it 1-1 now boys?
[2:01:24] thatluckyloser: one for none
[2:01:25] PoorMansPoison: unfortunate
[2:01:33] PoorMansPoison: I believe in the outscale
[2:01:40] thatluckyloser: Prayge
[2:01:40] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[2:01:43] Grognog: The ahri pick is doing a lot of work into the bot, smart from the enemy
[2:01:44] Oglino: Prayge 󠀀
[2:01:54] PoorMansPoison: Do not let them get early kills
[2:02:01] Swiftfool: yeah ahri is decent she can easily pick ashe lux vik
[2:02:03] thatluckyloser: is there hope?
[2:02:08] Oglino: yes
[2:02:10] PoorMansPoison: There is deffo hope
[2:02:12] Oglino: its not that doomed yet
[2:02:16] PoorMansPoison: Lawlman team scales like crazy
[2:02:17] Swiftfool: Hope is up to bossman and team to get picks
[2:02:32] RedFacedBeast: for me, on Viktor. Lvl 11, Ludens + alternator and stuff just starts dying... haha
[2:02:39] Grognog: One of those games where, were it solo queue, you'd just hang around bot as the jungler. Both sides
[2:02:46] PoorMansPoison: Lawlman does have to get online
[2:02:49] PoorMansPoison: for this to work
[2:02:50] ToutedDjinn: keep in mind chat, even in first game jellys team lead in kills NODDERS Def still have hope
[2:03:01] ToutedDjinn: lead in kills early i should say
[2:04:08] Percussion1: yeah that was not the engage
[2:04:30] Oglino: :0
[2:04:30] Swiftfool: YES LETS GOOO THATS HUGGGE
[2:04:31] Grognog: And there it is

[2:04:42] CitrusJerry: except for the kai'sa jelly's team falls off hard
[2:04:42] Swiftfool: THAT TP by Sett was sooo BAD
[2:04:44] Grognog: Rammus goes in, viktor zones backline. He gets isolated
[2:04:45] PoorMansPoison: Massive play
[2:04:45] Rejex15: HUGE
[2:04:54] PoorMansPoison: Sett leaving facilitated that whole thing
[2:05:01] Grognog: Gonna be a miserable game for the junglers lol
[2:05:06] Oglino: Lazzie bot to play for t1 NODDERS
[2:05:06] Moobot: Don't forget to drink water, especially you @lawlman! >:(
[2:05:08] Grognog: Who gets picked first
[2:05:27] jaxkmurphy: I’ve a feeling lawlman ain’t getting his viktor in this tourney again if they win this game LUL
[2:05:33] ToutedDjinn: Just farm NODDERS
[2:05:36] Oglino: even in drags and 6 grubs NODDERS
[2:05:58] Swiftfool: @jaxkmurphy everyone underestimates the viktor.... and if Boss man just warms up his Azir hes even better
[2:06:00] Uncertain_Fool: chat would you eat scuttle?
[2:06:07] Oglino: yes
[2:06:09] Grognog: @jaxkmurphy Best part is, there's like 3 other champs who do the same shit pretty much
[2:06:10] Oglino: Tasty
[2:06:22] ToutedDjinn: is the scuttle cooked or raw tink
[2:06:40] disseps: scuttle sushi

[2:06:52] disseps: :3
[2:07:04] jaxkmurphy: bro this team comp is so scary
[2:07:13] PoorMansPoison: When lazzie thrives the breathing room gets so much bigger
[2:07:17] jaxkmurphy: an ashe arrow hits and they just die
[2:07:23] Swiftfool: Lost 2nd match just to make it spicy, also this is good practice for the finals
[2:07:37] Oglino: I think if lazzie buys like rookern or something
[2:07:39] PoorMansPoison: Its still not a done deal
[2:07:40] Oglino: he just wins OMEGALUL
[2:07:45] Grognog: Can only see the enemy winning through picks now
[2:07:55] HadieHim: holy out played

[2:08:08] Percussion1: ahri's ankles in pieces
[2:08:11] Swiftfool: Ahri held onto the ult but Vik just wins if she does

[2:08:34] RedFacedBeast: He's supposed to be slow and vulnerable
[2:08:49] jaxkmurphy: yea definitely should of played the mental game there and hit him with the ?

[2:16:27] Grognog: Aye, think that's the key
[2:16:37] Uncertain_Fool: illaoi raid boss
[2:16:43] Grognog: A tankier jungle with engage/disengage options
