[2:30:50] Lazynameross: lol
[2:30:53] pulsetd: his movement is McSussy

[2:30:55] bladetrinity16: @ChromaKhroma shurelyas
[2:31:02] ChromaKhroma: ooh yea
[2:31:05] voidmoons: usually the hwei sup build is sheralyas into horizon into void
[2:31:19] ThomasTheTwink: yeah he was going shurleya horizon cryptbloom before

[2:31:39] Cariyla: owo
[2:31:44] bladetrinity16: ill bloom you bla
[2:31:47] jannablowsu: @Cariyla i had a roommate in college that scripted on vayne  old kog that could exceed as cap and karthus iirc when he was ready to quit league
[2:31:48] voidmoons: crypto!??!!
[2:31:49] voidmoons: jk
[2:31:56] Cariyla: @jannablowsu nodd
[2:32:07] bored_degen: what if you build rylais to make zeri harder to dodge spells
[2:32:08] jannablowsu: he had no self control and wanted his acct perma banned so he couldnt play anymore
[2:32:18] Cariyla: Ya a former "friend" of mine scripts to boost
[2:32:25] Cariyla: More like someone who I happened to know
[2:32:26] voidmoons: ewwww
[2:32:37] jannablowsu: this guy is still a good friend of mine hes a really nice guy
[2:32:44] Lazynameross: why not just randomize email + password lol
[2:32:51] jannablowsu: just wanted to have fun losing his acct
[2:33:03] bladetrinity16: @Lazynameross being perma banned removes all temptation to try recover it
[2:33:17] Cariyla: Tbh nowadays
[2:33:25] Cariyla: Scripters mostly play Zeri/Jinx/Twitch
[2:33:25] Lazynameross: you cant recover if you dont know login details either im sure
[2:33:29] Cariyla: The hyper carries
[2:33:31] Cariyla: PepeLaugh
[2:33:34] voidmoons: true
[2:33:36] DesuLaDesu: damn she's so fast
[2:33:37] Lazynameross: but if he wanted to go out guns blazing then lol
[2:33:48] MrPigC: scripting is cringe
[2:33:53] Cariyla: Very
[2:34:03] ThomasTheTwink: why did q go that way
[2:34:05] Cariyla: But hey she has like a week
[2:34:10] Cariyla: Then vanguard
[2:34:11] Cariyla: Gladge
[2:34:21] jannablowsu: Truege
[2:34:23] nuttyytft: Gladge
[2:34:39] bigmikey47: I find it easier to hit scripters with skill shots since I can’t click for shit anyway
[2:34:41] Juliaggpolka: has vanguard been implemented yet?
[2:34:41] Lazynameross: jamm
[2:34:46] bladetrinity16: not yet
[2:34:47] Lazynameross: nah they had to delay
[2:34:50] jannablowsu: do i have any reason to be concerned about vanguard guys
[2:34:51] bladetrinity16: this coming week i believe
[2:34:55] jannablowsu: with regard to slowing pc
[2:34:58] bladetrinity16: shouldnt
[2:34:58] nuttyytft: wait but if scripting is dead what excuse do i tell my friends when im hardstuck Despairge
[2:34:59] jannablowsu: or bugs or anything
[2:35:16] bladetrinity16: the only issue most people have is its always on
[2:35:20] ChromaKhroma: @nuttyytft bad teammates agreeGe
[2:35:24] Ro3L: Well for starters i dont want a rootkit on my pc
[2:35:24] bladetrinity16: even when you dont have riot game open
[2:35:24] Juliaggpolka: @jannablowsu as long you run no cfg scripts i think it should be fine
[2:35:32] nuttyytft: @nuttyytft agreeGe
[2:35:38] Lazynameross: always on sounds kinda silly
[2:35:40] Lazynameross: like why
[2:35:45] jannablowsu: with my match history you canbe certain i dont script quantHehe
[2:35:46] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[2:35:47] ChromaKhroma: someone said u can turn it off
[2:35:54] Cariyla: you can
[2:35:54] Ro3L: So if vanguard drops I'll have to stop playing league
[2:36:00] bladetrinity16: closing out in task manager
[2:36:01] MrPigC: riot cares more about player retention than scripting, so im sure average pcs will be just fine
[2:36:03] Cariyla: you just have to restart PC if you want to play league again after turning it off
[2:36:07] Cariyla: eeeh
[2:36:15] voidmoons: graves Erm
[2:36:16] Lazynameross: will there be an option to have it auto stop when i close riot client?
[2:36:22] voidmoons: CLOSE
[2:36:28] ThomasTheTwink: close!
[2:36:33] colaaaaaddict: this ez is wokege
[2:36:39] vrgambit: Idk I hate playing games like this out i don't want to play vs a robot
[2:36:44] vrgambit: Id rather ff
[2:36:50] MrPigC: @vrgambit same
[2:36:51] Ro3L: No @lazynameross as it's loaded before windows
[2:37:03] Lazynameross: ResidentSleeper
[2:37:10] jannablowsu: im just Scared bc of how buggy riots client is for me
[2:37:11] bigmikey47: @vrgambit I’d rather beat the cunt
[2:37:27] bladetrinity16: riot client is buggy af for everyone
[2:37:32] CrishMedina: adge
[2:37:35] bladetrinity16: vanguard wont make that worse or better
[2:37:37] Cariyla: @Ro3L Have you ever played Fortnite/PUBG/RB6/Apex? Because all those have kernel level anti cheats
[2:37:43] jannablowsu: no
[2:37:47] jannablowsu: none of them
[2:37:47] Cariyla: The only difference is they generally aren't always on
[2:37:48] Cariyla: eeeh
[2:37:48] bigmikey47: my clients fine lol
[2:37:54] Ro3L: Nope I haven't
[2:37:54] jannablowsu: i only play league and tft
[2:38:00] Cariyla: stuntNoted
[2:38:04] bladetrinity16: pretty much every anticheat now is kernel level

[2:38:23] Cariyla: d4bad BASED
[2:38:24] bergsdal: who is scripting?
[2:38:29] bladetrinity16: @bergsdal zeri
[2:38:31] voidmoons: zeri
[2:38:38] bergsdal: ooh shie
[2:38:40] bladetrinity16: chat im hungy
[2:38:42] jannablowsu: if i had people that played rs i might return to that game owo
[2:38:48] voidmoons: hi hungry im sarah
[2:38:54] sololanediff: joined late, is she really scripting?
[2:38:55] bladetrinity16: @jannablowsu 3 or os o:
[2:38:55] Lazynameross: ratJAM
[2:38:56] Cariyla: hi sarah im iris
[2:38:57] Cariyla: owoSpin
[2:39:00] voidmoons: owoSpin
[2:39:25] jannablowsu: @bladetrinity16 idk i havent played in a long tiiiime i think i got 99 summoning and quit
[2:39:29] kite0_0: @sololanediff yep
[2:39:30] voidmoons: BIG
[2:39:30] bladetrinity16: ohhh
[2:39:34] Cariyla: Summoning is RS3 nodd
[2:39:45] jannablowsu: @bladetrinity16 like in 2010 i think i quit
[2:39:46] syfhero: clean!
[2:39:46] bladetrinity16: one of the 99s i dont have xD
[2:39:59] vrgambit: Do you think rylais would help or do all your abilities slow already
[2:40:00] ThomasTheTwink: oml runescape was my shit
[2:40:01] ChromaKhroma: danse
[2:40:04] bergsdal: how does scripting help you play league btw?
[2:40:07] bladetrinity16: @vrgambit gotta land them
[2:40:08] Cariyla: Same
[2:40:10] jjennukka: @sololanediff apparently shes a known scripter, her account suggesting so too, and her dodges are very sus
[2:40:15] Cariyla: I still play OSRS every now and then
[2:40:16] bladetrinity16: @bergsdal dodges skill shots/helps you land them
[2:40:19] jannablowsu: 07-08 rs was so lit
[2:40:26] vrgambit: The one that makes a field aoe would proc rylais
[2:40:29] ChromaKhroma: @vrgambit qq and qw dont slow but everything else slows/cc's
[2:40:49] bergsdal: @bladetrinity16 As a program aids in predicting the enemy behaviour and plays for you? XD
[2:40:58] bergsdal: is it automatic
[2:41:00] DesuLaDesu: I remember on xerathmains, someone made a thread complaining they got banned, the comments were initially like "omg the haters always accuse of us scripting" but the OP then said they were actually using scripts LMAO
[2:41:10] ThomasTheTwink: lmao
[2:41:16] jannablowsu: all the minigames wernt dead then i think when i quit it felt like people stopped having fun
[2:41:31] jannablowsu: i remember PC and castle wars were deadish when i left
[2:41:35] ChromaKhroma: they recognize exactly where the enemy throwing the ability the exact frame they throw it and dodge automatically @bergsdal
[2:41:43] Cariyla: @bergsdal there's different levels there's scripts that warn you of enemy threat ranges and such and then there's auto dodge/kite/hit skillshots scripts
[2:41:46] bergsdal: @ChromaKhroma mmmmm wow thats cheatts
[2:41:48] ChromaKhroma: there's also scripts for hitting spells, efficient autoattacking, etc
[2:41:55] unapologeticdrunk: playing the game as it is already makes me hate myself. if i were cheating idk what i'd do
[2:41:55] bergsdal: yikes
[2:42:13] bergsdal: thats not organic expression of skill
[2:42:16] jannablowsu: theres a humanizer on the scripts too
[2:42:18] Cariyla: Truege
[2:42:32] bladetrinity16: some scripters will toggle mid game
[2:42:43] Cariyla: I definitely know people who felt they "deserved high elo" but teams holding them back so they scripted so team couldn't hold them back
[2:42:44] Cariyla: And that just
[2:42:49] jannablowsu: iirc you can set the reaction time of the scripts
[2:42:58] cloudydaisies: stuntCalculated
[2:43:00] Cariyla: I don't get it what's the point if it isn't your own doing
[2:43:24] ChromaKhroma: some ppl just like winning even if they didnt try for it
[2:43:29] ChromaKhroma: i guess
[2:43:29] bergsdal: wow, I really hope vanguard makes a big difference in that case bcs, scripters in that case promote anti-human design and anti-human gameplay XD
[2:43:38] bergsdal: tthats not fun
[2:43:45] bergsdal: yikes and ew
[2:43:50] bladetrinity16: it does its job really well on val
[2:43:57] jannablowsu: i doubt it makes a diff unless you are in diamond + and even diamond is prob low
[2:44:04] ProfessionalDilettante: stunt livess
[2:44:19] BaneBladeV: steal it Madge
[2:44:19] ThomasTheTwink: hwei is safe
[2:44:23] bergsdal: ye, i dont know how big scripting is in league
[2:44:38] bladetrinity16: not as big as it is in shooers
[2:44:41] Stitch_suplol: another zeri is scripting?
[2:44:42] bladetrinity16: shooters*
[2:44:45] bergsdal: lets see, better than nothing IF its prevelent
[2:44:51] jannablowsu: i cannot imagine how bad you have to be at league to be stuck in diamond or lower with scripts turning the training wheels on for you
[2:44:59] bergsdal: XD true
[2:44:59] Cariyla: Truege
[2:45:01] Ro3L: Depends if you use external PCIe slot to load your own cheat before Vanguard and simulate the inputs
[2:45:02] som963: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:45:07] Stitch_suplol: Lotta scripters in high elo
[2:45:11] bladetrinity16: @jannablowsu they would normally be with my bronze 3 ass xD
[2:45:13] bergsdal: shameless behaviour
[2:45:14] mute_mousou: 5% of the time? wow
[2:45:21] MrPigC: it's really bad if you play a lot
[2:45:25] Cariyla: yeah lotta scripters in high master/low GM
[2:45:26] Cariyla: xdd
[2:45:51] Stitch_suplol: I feel like high gm and in chall
[2:46:00] Cariyla: stuntNoted
[2:46:03] jannablowsu: @bladetrinity16 like my friend i think peaked low plat iirc and with scripts i think he got to diamond and was still climbing easily dont remember wr or anything
[2:46:23] ChromaKhroma: singed hit that antiscript E button
[2:46:23] Cariyla: We should bring back old Taric to combat scripting
[2:46:26] Kinkou_Order: hi janna owo
[2:46:30] Cariyla: I'd like to see you dodge the point and click stun
[2:46:30] bladetrinity16: well yeah scripts abuse the most broken metric in the game, movespeed
[2:46:31] Cariyla: xdd
[2:46:31] Kinkou_Order: hi chroma owo
[2:46:32] MrPigC: ahri kinda smurfed that though
[2:46:34] jannablowsu: just remember how funny it was watching kogmaw dodge everything with 5.0+ as
[2:46:37] ChromaKhroma: hi hyena owo
[2:46:52] Stitch_suplol: singed is good af here
[2:46:52] jannablowsu: hi hyena :3
[2:47:08] bigmikey47: is there any hwei abilities you don’t use at all cause they’re dog shit?
[2:47:10] Cariyla: hi-ena
[2:47:13] Cariyla: :3
[2:47:19] sololanediff: Janna solo bolo just secured dragon I guess.
[2:47:51] jannablowsu: like the diff zeri has is absurd
[2:47:54] bladetrinity16: that is my one pet peeve with smolder, his R will fizzle as he dies even if it was mid cast
[2:47:54] ProfessionalDilettante: holy moly this exreal
[2:47:54] voidmoons: @bigmikey47 most of his kit is really useful
[2:47:58] caiothird: this ez is so good

[2:49:09] bergsdal: ahhh ofc
[2:49:12] MrPigC: his w having scaling with ad is good
[2:49:13] bladetrinity16: his W early is getting nerfed, but stronger later
[2:49:19] caiothird: maaaaan they are tping to save a scripter
[2:49:21] Cariyla: @jannablowsu Because he's not supposed to have a good laning phase PepeLaugh

[2:49:41] jannablowsu: i never lose against him and never win with him
[2:49:43] bergsdal: it is unethical lp idd XD
[2:49:45] Cariyla: He's pretty good HmmCouncil

[9:42:41] craqzyyy: can you do more undercover videos?
[9:42:57] belatolls: yeah potomac is basically dc
[9:43:14] belatolls: there are a lot of asians in DMV maryland. it depends where in md
[9:43:14] jcath004: DC has people from every country on earth
[9:43:17] froggys1ime: oh no Maryland has a lot of asian people!
[9:43:25] trowaman: DC is full of them
[9:43:29] jcath004: there are plenty of Asian-Americans here and there
[9:43:30] belatolls: yeah it is very different further from DC
[9:43:34] denunciator: you know, i kinda vibe with this aesthetic
[9:43:34] belatolls: for such a small state
[9:43:35] froggys1ime: yeah it definitely depends where you're from, where I was from it was a real melting pot of all kinds of cultures
[9:43:48] colaaaaaddict: chonky  leg
[9:43:52] Ghostloon: iirc one of the LCS pros is from Maryland

[9:45:28] ems__c: really in LA?
[9:45:38] jcath004: does potato shed mean something different to architecture people
[9:45:43] Whattehpho: i've been enjoying yuumi with smolder
[9:45:43] hanaan: it's why I'd never move back to London unless I had stupid money
[9:45:44] PharmDRPh: depends if you ever want to retire
[9:45:47] denunciator: in most metropolises including where i live, 800-1.5mil for an apartment is normal
[9:45:50] denunciator: Sadge
[9:45:50] belatolls: you dont have time to do manual labor if youre working jobs that let you afford a place like that
[9:46:07] belatolls: you gotta work the kind of jobs that pay so much they think they own you
[9:46:27] denunciator: if you do manual labor in a low COL area you probably end up building your own house
[9:47:06] denunciator: Vanguard
[9:47:06] belatolls: index funds
[9:47:07] hanaan: MSCI World
[9:47:08] denunciator: KEKW

[9:47:16] denunciator: all index-linked funds are pretty good
[9:47:16] PharmDRPh: s&p 500
[9:47:23] froggys1ime: but that 60k has to be spent on current rent/bills/food so it becomes a lot less than 60k over a year!  Not to mention insurance costs
[9:47:47] PharmDRPh: you can’t afford a milly house on 60k
[9:47:57] som963: a dolla
[9:48:14] hanaan: how much would someone on 60k usd be spending on rent out there though
[9:48:26] Ghostloon: Stunt gets those "Buy 10 for the price of 5" deals
[9:48:32] hanaan: and how long did it take them to get to 60k how old are they
[9:48:41] hanaan: like are they sharing still at 32 or what
[9:48:54] Ghostloon: GAMBA
[9:49:08] jcath004: do you have angry bee bound for this game?
[9:49:09] froggys1ime: I can only use my experience but we make closely to 60k a year and our rent is about 1.5k, so you do kinda lose out on at least 12kish a year here
[9:49:16] PharmDRPh: general goal is to spend about 30% on housing but can’t do that easily in some locations
[9:49:17] Deielrion: @hanaan I know people at over 125k/yr graduates
[9:49:18] KaratelBanderivskyi: @stunt make prediction please🙏  or mods, if u can🥰
