[0:35:27] SaintBlarney: @TrundleTop1 Could you give tips on "attack move" play style / any setup in game? I'm moving from Yorick / Illaoi to Trundle... Attack move and spacing is a bigger deal. Do you use "champ only" or anything?
[0:35:41] tobyteemo: i think it's cuz you grew without the cam so ppl expect no cam
[0:35:43] Scarred_Eye: Dang
[0:35:46] BelleOCE: really? i thought cam viewers wouldgive you more
