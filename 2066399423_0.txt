[1:00:23] sebastianminiatures: that blitz hooked your LP
[1:00:34] Gabb049: I wonder, why is these people high elo? they're mentally weak and don't want to win
[1:00:59] sebastianminiatures: the bot double kill into full map meltdown was unfortunate
[1:01:56] getsometalentloser: i dont have an assassin in my pool dosent fit my play style lol
[1:04:37] sebastianminiatures: this cassio has the mental of a n iron player
[1:08:04] smartasspawn: lec finals usually delivers when they look onesided before. i am a bit hyped
[1:08:14] smartasspawn: also mdk has some cool picks and g2 is g2
[1:08:48] basik: why don't people play vex bot into kalista? vex destroys kalista with empowered autos every time she auto-dashes
[1:10:05] liquidcarrot: Santorin, love your stream, keep it up! Btw what does Bjergsen do today? I've watched you guys play together at TSM looong time ago

[1:31:12] KillerB123: last time i played gragas into ksante it did not go well lol
[1:31:31] jgroove4: so just trying to understand, why look bot instead of mid there?
[1:32:02] smartasspawn: gragas is my fallback pick when i dont know what to play
[1:32:13] lardyparty: In LEC Game 5 yesterday they did gragas last pick into kasante as well
[1:32:24] lardyparty: Probably why
[1:32:57] JAYMANTV: why the stridebreaker build?
[1:33:04] jgroove4: gotcha, thank you I appreciate your insight
[1:33:20] basik: they are giving up varus strength in favor of azir, which is smart on their part i think
[1:34:03] KillerB123: lol
[1:34:26] KillerB123: ghosting?
[1:34:42] basik: blitz is useless bot, he made the right play

[1:38:02] sebastianminiatures: @basik excuse me, they're plated steelcaps... :P
[1:38:33] CynicalScrub: did varus just flash after the hook missed? or did he flash it last second?

[3:12:40] hansel_lionheart: can you do a teletubbies score instead of a win/loss?
[3:12:43] wangstra: any interest playing warwick this season?
[3:12:51] pandamixed: it was a Viego angle KevinTurtle
[3:13:10] madgym02: any potential teletubbies merch
[3:14:49] getsometalentloser: warwick is just a cheese pick
[3:15:16] wangstra: @getsometalentloser what do you mean? his r?
[3:15:23] Dezrunner: Yes, what? :P
[3:15:39] getsometalentloser: no the champ is just cheesy hoping ur opponent dosent kno what to do
[3:16:07] nap343: Do u think MDK can take 1 win off G2 ?
[3:16:18] Dezrunner: You just called out my name... figured you missed me :P
[3:17:20] Dezrunner: Yessir
[3:17:50] Dezrunner: Yeah, his name choice is so odd
[3:17:56] Kai0Shin05: play viego
[3:18:23] Kraysys: happy sunday
[3:18:30] Dezrunner: And his name is Dennis, no?
[3:18:37] ntmadeit: they are playing mind games
[3:19:06] Kraysys: adc is a weak role
[3:19:36] ntmadeit: only bjergsen is normal :D
[3:19:57] Dezrunner: I doubt Bjergerking is normal haha
[3:20:07] Dezrunner: man played this game for 14 hours a day for 10 years
[3:20:50] ntmadeit: why do you think a lot of danish players managed to be really good in league ?
[3:20:58] Kraysys: or learning about medicine
[3:21:03] Baker076: i still play halo3 and melee. even older
[3:21:21] Dezrunner: I wish i would have spent 10% of my time in front of the pc on playing guitar
[3:21:45] Dezrunner: sabbatical, im pretty sure
[3:22:59] ntmadeit: so you can take a year after middle school or high school?
[3:23:03] Kraysys: wait i went to school for free? i was born in the wrong country FeelsStrongMan
[3:24:15] ntmadeit: is it same for universities ?
[3:24:56] mitchmiester93: Yeah, as someone who is finishing medical school in the US in May... The loan system here sucks
[3:25:07] Dezrunner: Well, its free to go to university... you can finish 1 full education for free
[3:25:29] Dezrunner: after that i'm pretty sure you have to pay something, but compared to other countries, its still pretty low i believe
[3:25:32] DanSkermy: in uk its 9k a year to go to uni, plus your living costs etc, you then pay this back once you earn over a certain threshold
[3:26:23] DanSkermy: that 9k a year is considered a loan so it grows with interest etc
[3:26:25] getsometalentloser: @DanSkermy though they will take any internation student they can
[3:26:33] getsometalentloser: to get that dollar
[3:26:56] mdiesel394: really smart people typically get scholarships where the cost is covered, but yeah in a lot of cases it sucks
[3:27:14] Dezrunner: you can rack up loans here too, and they can get pretty big ;)
[3:27:31] Dezrunner: life costs on the side of education, like books, transport etc
[3:27:43] Dezrunner: You pay for books in uni
[3:27:43] mdiesel394: in my state the cost if tuition is covered if you get decent grades too
[3:28:28] ntmadeit: how did your family react to your league career, were they supportive?
[3:28:34] Dezrunner: I remember having to choose which subjects I just wouldn't buy the books for, cuz I couldnt afford it, heh
[3:28:55] Falcnation: theres free tuition programs in new york too but it only covers tuition, not room and board so if you dont like a commutable distance it still sucks lol
[3:29:52] sebastianminiatures: oops sorry mom and dad, it worked I am a pro now :p

[4:19:05] KoS_Bunnyslippers: just joined
[4:19:27] KoS_Bunnyslippers: but I guarantee you've complained about someone first time champ in ranked
[4:20:01] KoS_Bunnyslippers: could have done karthus which is easier
[4:20:14] KoS_Bunnyslippers: and you've done that in jungle
[4:20:55] dutchmedic: MADK just destroyed G2 game 1
[4:21:23] Falcnation: strange he's coming at you usually your chat is pretty chill
[4:22:32] jaymesblack: there is a big difference between someone who is very good at the game first timing a champ and someone who is silver and first timing lee sin in autofilled jungle game
[4:23:07] Falcnation: also its one thing if he played like hwei ziggs is an easy champ
[4:23:54] jaymesblack: your pick makes complete sense
[4:24:20] jaymesblack: i was just providing some rationale to that guy from earlier
[4:26:47] jaymesblack: yea thats a rough one
[4:27:28] jaymesblack: they gotta int a few times
[4:30:44] Hirumaya: can you do a quick explanation of why anti-healing is a bad call from graves? they seem to have a crazy amount of healing on their end
[4:31:56] huanpc: you can play everlyn
[4:32:04] jaymesblack: ex call gives you the same effect as the full item however you want more dmg as graves which is given by ldr
[4:32:38] CeremonD: better show in training room
[4:33:09] jaymesblack: basically ldr gives you more effective dmg than mortal reminder
[4:34:32] Hirumaya: that makes sense, thanks!
[4:35:44] jaymesblack: supports get their wards later with that nerf
[4:36:58] jaymesblack: pretty big buff i think
