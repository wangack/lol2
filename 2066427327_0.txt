[3:41:39] Dexef: @abel_k9 it's to inform you that if you bring them low enough your smolder will kill them, it makes sense
[3:41:48] TheDeadication: SMORC armor

[3:42:32] ImScottLol: @abel_k9 it's literally recoded elder, it functions just like elder.
[3:42:45] Dexef: yeah because usually its like "if you bring them this low, and your champion with execute presses a button it will killed them", with smolder the kill happens automatically
[3:43:03] Garnene: @abel_k9 thats because smolders execute is a dot that persists and can be triggered by other players getting them low while its ticking
[3:43:15] Lergaze: Smolder has stacks
[3:43:38] Dexef: stackmaxxed and creeppilled
