[1:04:50] BadInGood: so, you ARE toxic?  =D
[1:04:50] fluffycloudlove: @kaypea I tried a Moscow mule drink yesterday it had vodka ginger beer some like and mint garnish it wasn’t too bad any drinks worth trying from Canada or Denmark?
[1:04:52] mrshibasan: THE SHIBA IS AALLLLL UP AND READYYYY
[1:05:10] Jaketin8: Games like that feel like they rigged for one side to win, and they also tend to get boring real fast, for both sides
[1:05:31] innerpeace1: @kaypea I suggest you try to reduce your mmr this game. So your next game you don't get 4 ai your side vs 5 human
[1:05:55] MissUnfortuneK: i guess its the apology from riot for your last game
[1:05:57] shedfirekid1: so many ults

[1:20:13] kreumbly: tbh the mentality of players in emerald/diamond are much worse than people in bronze/silver
[1:20:18] Loksdead: locks and koi panda
[1:20:19] mistermurr: Transfers are disabled right now, right?
[1:20:32] PixydolI: Sorry I was tabbed out having dinner.. thank you so much @fluffycloudlove for the wonderful gift <3 kaypCozy  I hope you have a really amazing day and weekend ^^

[1:21:00] bragismuse_scathach: makes me scared to climb just because of the ego
[1:21:01] kreumbly: will have someone spamming "gg, afk" at like 4 minutes after 1 death lol
[1:21:04] FreeXe: There was a bug couple weeks ago. A friend of mine started to play for the first time. After a month he played ranked and got Emerald 4 L O L. He played 2-3 games and got hard flame non stop and dropped to plat, so he stopped playing.
[1:21:07] PixydolI: Hello kaypea, hope you have wonderful day so far ^^
[1:21:30] regiszox: hi
[1:21:35] layeuna: Kaypea do you like art? :3
[1:21:46] FrostySupreem: I always mute the chat
[1:21:59] reybabid: Hi KP! Hi everyone! 🫶
[1:22:08] FrostySupreem: I play the game to what I know and just try to win
[1:22:10] innerpeace1: @kaypea if you want to add 1 extra champion to champion pool, which one would you add?
[1:22:20] amethyst_art22: hey kels.. just came from a couple of games that started out Emerald 4 and ended with Emerald 4 optomi1Smoulder optomi1Smoulder

[1:23:01] mrshibasan: lmao
[1:23:08] amethyst_art22: and they said emeralg was supposed to be a lucky color
[1:23:16] kreumbly: yupppp

[1:23:59] The1997wiki: lol sylas and senna bot
[1:24:01] Fremdo: tank snider is a thing now, I played against a rioter in a game yesterday and HOLY COW you couldn’t kill him but he killed you in 3 hits
[1:24:03] jimbob_ywert: Leblanc is really strong
[1:24:05] innerpeace1: My last effort was stuck 1 game to master . Then I got 5 loose strike with troll teammates ...
[1:24:11] Fremdo: smolder
[1:24:13] pistolpetey34: ask the bobby lb godf
[1:24:31] mistermurr: Soo adding a new rank has not helped so far?

[1:24:37] Jaguar542: Prediction?: Will Smolder go tank or ad?
[1:24:39] The1997wiki: smolder q is like elder dragon buff after 225 stacks
[1:24:40] kreumbly: new tech actually. senna counters smolder. senna has a higher wr as adc than she does as a supp lol
[1:24:54] Darkcyter: @Breidaia 93 kaypHYPERS WB
[1:24:59] jimbob_ywert: if she gets a small lead, she snowballs insanely strong. if she’s behind she’s useless.
[1:25:08] Darkcyter: @The1997wiki @kreumbly @pistolpetey34 kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[1:25:08] FrostySupreem: 25K Peas to Senna most damage
[1:25:21] The1997wiki: @Darkcyter kaypFlower kaypFlower kaypFlower
[1:25:23] FrostySupreem: I'm rich
[1:25:55] jimbob_ywert: I am one of the sweaty predictors
[1:26:01] Jothor83: sweaty peas
[1:26:04] The1997wiki: prob he gonoo go hybrid ap ad
[1:26:09] kreumbly: at one point adc senna had the highest wr of any adc lol
[1:26:10] Jaguar542: that was just for fun, but do you go tank Lux every Lux game?
[1:26:12] mistermurr: We take predictions VERY seriously here kaypHarmony
[1:26:15] kreumbly: idk if its still the same atm
[1:26:16] jimbob_ywert: I won’t forget that one time I lost 100k from predictions and almost lost my mind
[1:26:25] yanjii: yanjii subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! WELCOME BACK, long time no seeeee

[1:27:04] kreumbly: oh, are they nerfing her to the ground again? lol
[1:27:08] yanjii: I've been fine how are youu
[1:27:09] Fremdo: You’re getting me through my 10 hour watch, I have 4 hours left
[1:28:10] The1997wiki: oh sylas is the sup adc is senna
[1:28:10] mistermurr: Isn't it so satisfying when you get that roll back q instantly on Ahri? kaypHUH
[1:28:32] gdeamonlord: your farming is kinda clear
[1:28:33] Jaguar542: KP getting greedy, she saw a blind monk"
[1:28:35] kreumbly: gross. they are nerfing her but they are gonna leave champs like illaoi, sylas and and xin as is lol
[1:29:12] Littlegreenbannana: Mann all i want is a nerf to Zyras passive
[1:29:13] mrshibasan: i like how you dont care of your team score is 0 to 5
[1:29:15] jimbob_ywert: why hasn’t TF not received a nerf, I don’t know
[1:29:23] bragismuse_scathach: that sucks, senna was my win card for a while; she still can be, it just feels harder
[1:29:27] FreeXe: I don't liek that AHri skin, but I do love the sound effect of it tho
[1:29:29] MissUnfortuneK: they are not gonna buff ahri?
[1:29:42] Darkcyter: @pistolpetey34 I wish :D
[1:29:49] jeroenvijver: leblanc chain range is kinda stupid
[1:29:49] Darkcyter: @yanjii WB
[1:29:58] kreumbly: @mrshibasan games can literally completely turn around with one misplay. there is no reason to even worry about score for first like 15-20 minutes unless someone is hard running it down
[1:30:03] AmaraSol: @Darkcyter kaypComfy
[1:30:19] SpringSong: lux dmg :)
[1:30:21] Jaguar542: if your Auto attack is on she will auto when rooted, so as you say just press S
[1:30:26] jimbob_ywert: do you have a key bind that idles your champ? by default it’s S
[1:30:41] mistermurr: Where did that dmg came from? O.o
[1:30:43] The1997wiki: she did a magic trick lol
[1:30:50] MissUnfortuneK: lb dmg
[1:30:51] shedfirekid1: mightve been q w damage?
[1:30:55] gdeamonlord: you did get rooted by lux tho

[1:32:42] Loksdead: ahri leahri charm
[1:33:14] FreeXe: You have auto attack on? You could toggle it off too
[1:34:48] mrshibasan: they are buffing her
[1:35:37] mistermurr: Next patch yes
[1:35:47] TyrTheTiny: OMG MY FAVORITE VARIETY STREAMER <3
[1:35:49] mrshibasan: her Q ap ratio by 5% increase

[1:36:51] yanjii: 22 feb
[1:36:51] hirika123: hiiiii

[1:37:09] TyrTheTiny: @Darkcyter kaypHello
[1:37:33] hirika123: is this NA server
[1:37:35] SarahiSalinas: Hola KayPea kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya
[1:37:43] crycouple0: hellu KP. Its been awhile watching your stream
[1:37:53] kyoshido66: there's a silas in your bot lane. shouldnt expect anything from them
[1:38:21] Loksdead: panddash
[1:38:27] crycouple0: NA or EU you enjoyed?
[1:38:53] kyoshido66: "not terrible" that discription tells me exactly how bad it is
[1:38:56] aezami: hello everone
[1:39:07] TyrTheTiny: 1 6 sylas support who "is not as terrible" just dies after kaypea finishes her sentence
[1:39:30] shedfirekid1: i despise tryndamere
[1:39:34] hirika123: omg so i thought u were playing on the NA server until now
[1:40:06] Niomah: Hello @KayPea and friends! Gotta compose a mail to my boss begging for the week of Christmas off (it's a blackout month for vacation) for my mom's bucket list family vegas vacation they already booked without telling me.
[1:40:13] Jothor83: its like the previous game only this time we are the wtf team
[1:40:34] deadmenwalkingofficial: !rank
[1:40:34] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu
[1:41:06] Fremdo: Your bot needed to play for late, until senna got 70 souls esp
[1:41:44] kreumbly: I think you stole the gromp, you got 80 gold when you threw Q out over there xD
[1:42:24] Jothor83: i like the captain flowers 40-40-20 rule when it comes to climbing
[1:42:58] megilino: @Jothor83 Tell me more
[1:42:59] Jothor83: yeah thats the tldr
[1:43:33] Jothor83: 40% your team will smurf on the enemy 40% no matter what you do you ll not be able to carry cuz your team is bad , and 20% your performance will make it a win or loss
[1:43:55] hirika123: i need a lux ss14 vid
[1:44:19] kyoshido66: dam. silas just reset his bounty
[1:44:26] realMoppo: hello there kaypFreya
[1:44:32] AmberAnjuna: Hey KP <3
[1:44:35] Jothor83: @kyoshido66 thats the wrong kind of reset
[1:44:49] charm_xx: but in reality its just a mess
[1:45:14] TheKindestBoy: i mean it should around 4-6 in every 10 games
[1:45:34] charm_xx: it makes sense though it actually feels that way except if its a smurf account
[1:45:40] the_mi1ky_pirate: Depends what role you play too. If you play jg it's prob way more then 20%
[1:45:41] jimbob_ywert: apparently according to stats someone did, in a game where each game is 50/50 win a win streak and loss streak will come up ever 100 games
[1:45:44] charm_xx: i feel like i rarely have taht much control
[1:45:53] kreumbly: Smolder is going a hybrid bruiser build
[1:46:00] kyoshido66: monst truths are hardsh
[1:46:07] kyoshido66: most*
[1:46:10] Jothor83: its a team game with 10 players the fact you can impact 2 out of 10 feels like what math should tell us but again sometimes you can roll bad times a lot of times
[1:46:10] kreumbly: gonna get a liandry's to pair with q max stacks
[1:46:49] Jothor83: that combo was nasty
[1:46:52] kyoshido66: i see why he lost bot lane now
[1:47:10] Fremdo: Storm surge is an insane item imo tho
[1:47:24] Jaguar542: Think on the bright side, your CS is amazing! kaypFreya
[1:48:11] Jothor83: CS improvement we take those
[1:48:19] jimbob_ywert: @charm_xx depends on your lane. If you’re ADC then yes you can complain about not having control (sorry adc mains) but every other role can carry or make a change and you don’t have to be fed doing it. Roaming, shotcalling, focusing objectives all factor into winning calls that can change the games results even if you’re like 0-15
[1:48:52] jimbob_ywert: @fremdo not anymore it sucks so much now
[1:49:09] kreumbly: You and Illaoi are going to need to go get some disability payments for your backs after this game. holy
[1:50:04] Jothor83: imagine needing a back massage after each game cuz your back is broking from carrying
[1:50:12] Jothor83: broken*
[1:50:51] Toelboell: the reason the supports pushes a lane, is because it needs to be pushed but no one is doing it
[1:51:17] jimbob_ywert: DAMN YOURE INSANE KP

[1:58:48] isFabs: lich bane is made when malignance is made too
[1:58:52] berdewisangry: And also, autoing into them is gonna be hard with smolder burning everyone asses
[1:58:57] kreumbly: Malignance adds so much damage from ult in teamfights, every time you dash with it, it puts the damage circles under everyone
[1:58:59] isFabs: if u make one u make another
[1:58:59] jimbob_ywert: Lich bane is good but against their team comp not sure if it’s the best
[1:59:05] Jothor83: KP saying dont fight reminds me Thor telling Hulk not to attack , and Hulk being but big monster
[1:59:25] atichii: 9 PauseChamp

[2:03:05] mrshibasan: You will enjoy the AP ratio increase of AHri's Q
[2:03:23] atichii: eyes YEP
[2:03:31] kreumbly: @KayPea You got full build this game, but you should def try malignance in a game with ahri. a ton of mobility with lower ult cd and good teamfight damage.
[2:03:56] dutchyjos: peepoHey
[2:04:13] berdewisangry: Malignance sounds...bad no_
[2:04:19] Rinniera: @kreumbly Second this, malignance + lichbane is really good on her
[2:04:42] mistermurr: kaypWHAT kaypWHAT
[2:04:50] Rinniera: @berdewisangry Malignance reduces the CD of your ult even more, you can be super mobile and very strong with it
[2:04:55] Jothor83: she is an ocean drake this game so she heals
[2:05:08] Terhadalas: that escalated quickly
[2:05:10] sparkman347: thats tuff
[2:05:14] pix_moon: no way
[2:05:14] shan_192: thats so unfortunate
[2:05:14] babyhydra: nt nt
[2:05:18] mistermurr: No freaking way u.u
[2:05:25] berdewisangry: But instead of malignance i should take the shield item
[2:05:32] ragtimediddly: gotta love the 0 counterplay to champs that can jsut take 3 towers in about 30 seconds SeemsGood
[2:05:34] Rinniera: Ludens is way more subpar than malignance
[2:05:36] berdewisangry: any day of the week
[2:05:47] Rinniera: Not that that was the issue that game anyways
[2:05:47] mark__yeahhh: would you still consider playing neeko?
[2:05:52] Phieldworker: hello there
[2:05:53] TyrTheTiny: did you guys win that?
[2:05:53] mistermurr: What a sad game
[2:05:58] charm_xx: ITS THAT 40 %
[2:05:59] TyrTheTiny: nvm I can read the room
[2:06:02] SlayNeela: i hate splitting champs it rly sucks to loose like that
[2:06:04] mistermurr: And you were doing so gold
[2:06:04] mrshibasan: Ironic that malignance ahri helped her sky rocket her win rate of 56% winrate
[2:06:07] BigDaddyGaddy07: good morning KayPea how are you?
[2:06:16] darjar12: newjeans song????
[2:06:20] Terhadalas: we tried and that's what matters! kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:06:26] norby75: they should really buff nexus/base tower :D they get 2 shot late game, its ridiculous
[2:06:44] Loksdead: yeah cs

[2:07:35] TyrTheTiny: CHEER UP KP, you can always flame them later and send your fans to harrasmen online Kappa
[2:07:39] xxtitaniumsxx: how you doing
[2:07:55] pistolpetey34: @TyrTheTiny youre so right tho
[2:07:56] SlayNeela: did they have grubs?
[2:08:41] Phieldworker: I had to swap to bot lane to stop the frustration of bot lane leaving lane with 10 combined deaths.
[2:08:46] xxtitaniumsxx: you are better one games doesnt change anything ggs

[2:09:14] mistermurr: We have more magic pen items but they don't feel as aff
[2:09:22] ragtimediddly: It's just disheartening to know that because your team is slightly behind, you have to make the choice of drake/baron vs losing a lane of turrets because toplaners can just eat buildings and even if they die they probably take at least one champ with them
[2:09:23] mistermurr: Effective
[2:09:26] kendren25: Another beautiful Sunday. How is everyone?
[2:09:26] SlayNeela: i had the experience of whoever spam ganks bot usually wins
[2:09:33] TyrTheTiny: I KNOW! tanks now build tank items and deal a lot of damage, just like bruisers build ad/hp items and get really tanky while also doing damage. mages like sylas build ap and get tanky. it's just so dumb
[2:09:46] ataraxia78: Danger DinoDance
[2:10:12] mahducontilde: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[2:10:19] mistermurr: By the way you were performing, you should've not loose that much LP

[2:11:14] Loksdead: cs with nami lucian is rake
[2:12:22] SlayNeela: but then everyone will play for themselves and team play will kinda dissapear
[2:13:01] mrfire_____: How do you prevent people from kill stealing and taking every resource so they can pad their kda to raise their elo?
[2:13:07] harishm06: WASSSSSUPPPPPP KAYPEAAAAAAAAAA

[2:14:30] blondieforlife: good morning kels & friends kaypArrive kaypComfy kaypLove
[2:14:31] jimbob_ywert: @mrfire_____ If they get ahead, you just have to accept it and play around their lead. Your aim is to win, kills aren’t that important. just play with your lead to win.
[2:14:38] Phieldworker: went against a Viktor yesterday who builds rylais regularly on him. this was in emerald.
[2:15:26] mistermurr: I agree
[2:15:52] mistermurr: I would like that system much more than the current one
[2:15:57] Theowyn01: Heyyy. Good games, have fun!
[2:16:04] nassimiheb: For sure they need a more complicated rating system to give people S A or whatever, also it needs to be not publicly available, so no one can tune their game plan so they can be higher in ranking, but it has to be complex enough
[2:16:14] kendren25: Was an Annie song reference LUL
[2:16:19] Haxangul: thats a really good system so people actually try harder in games
[2:16:32] pepsio: just hanging around ... losing some lp... kaypHappea

[2:17:06] kendren25: KDA is just the most straightforward for people to understand
[2:17:10] woekid: @KayPea whats crack a lackin!!!!! howdy and good morning!
[2:17:12] Jothor83: KP is important also and i mean Kill Participation

[2:18:58] TheKindestBoy: @jimbob_ywert oh okay thx, and like what? azir? ori?

[2:20:58] nassimiheb: Yeah theocratically if everyone tries to do everything right, theocratically u would win xD
[2:21:23] mrfire_____: I get what you're saying. Riot doesn't do much to discourage people from first timing champs in ranked or playing champs they have really bad win rates on
[2:21:29] ragtimediddly: I assume you mean 'theoretically' lol
[2:21:36] maurrigane: Y
[2:21:46] nassimiheb: Lol yes
[2:21:49] tacobean1: Okay Kels, I'm gonna go take a nap before work. Love you dude, see ya next time
[2:21:55] SlayNeela: but if they see that their team is loosing a little then they start doing it and play for kda

[2:28:33] TepenTamot: whats the lore of viktor? anybody knows?

[2:29:58] Loksdead: our pooil fennekin koi  santorin shummerya
[2:30:13] MelBIanc: Emerald was created due to he fact that the skill of Plat players and Dia players was large and Plat players were ruining Dia players games. It’s the same way GM players feel about Master players. Hello from Van Island. kaypLove
[2:30:27] MelBIanc: Skill diff^^

[2:32:27] Phieldworker: and this is why I swapped to bot from mid sadly. every game felt like adc mental diff.
[2:32:28] jimbob_ywert: that’s so tilting.
[2:32:46] AllyCaatt: even mid kinda rough now ngl @phieldworker
[2:32:48] AllyCaatt: :(
[2:33:44] AllyCaatt: always the one afk
[2:33:47] AllyCaatt: feels bad
[2:34:10] SlayNeela: eve was trashtalking the lucian
[2:34:10] jimbob_ywert: like how do u deserve to lose LP for this
[2:34:24] nassimiheb: Fucking up and afking are extremely different things
[2:34:40] alinmeiky: I am on a defeat streak xD
[2:34:45] AllyCaatt: Sunday league days unfortunately
[2:35:18] jdupuis4: your stream is helping me keep from tilting over organic chemistry homework though regardless of how tilting riot is >.<
[2:35:29] mentalfordaayz: hey hi hell-ow happy sundae miss Kelsie kaypComfy are we on positive kda on win-lose scoreboard?
[2:35:39] SlayNeela: but why is it usually the adcs with the low mentality
[2:35:59] plynn1985: ez
[2:36:16] darjar12: kaypCheer
[2:36:25] nassimiheb: Auto attacking apparently affects mentality
[2:36:28] FrostySupreem: What KELS on Viktor?! WHAAA havent seen that in a LONG ass time
[2:36:53] jimbob_ywert: @slayneela because ADC is almost always useless in low elo when you’re behind
[2:37:00] jdupuis4: "auto attacking apparently affects mentality" lmaoooo yes
[2:37:16] FrostySupreem: Well i have been AFK a lot so, thats on me haha

[2:38:34] AllyCaatt: just play the game out don’t afk and ruin itttt

[2:40:18] TurtleIam: riot making harder for 4v5 comebacks
[2:40:37] FrostySupreem: You have like a certain amount of chances before you drop an Elo
[2:40:41] AllyCaatt: honestly they are
[2:40:49] FrostySupreem: I think maybe 5 chances
[2:40:51] SlayNeela: if u are league partner cant u ask riot if they could borrow u one
[2:40:52] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: 1 person can break and entire team :(
[2:40:57] TurtleIam: I dont think riot likes 4v5 comebacks as much as previous season
[2:41:09] FrostySupreem: WHAT?!
[2:41:11] SickeningTouchLoL: wait we can’t transfer accounts?
[2:41:12] FrostySupreem: DAMN
[2:41:26] Drewbertttt: my mmr is so in the dumpster than part of me doesnt even want to play lol

[2:41:31] jimbob_ywert: I’m simply grateful and enjoying my lap gains rn in gold because I know it’s gonna get fked as soon as I reach a higher rank :p
[2:41:38] angelofdeathjonathan: To be fair winning a 3v5 or 4v5 shows how bad riots match making is
[2:41:40] FrostySupreem: My MMR is still good then
[2:41:50] SickeningTouchLoL: @allycaatt damm that sucks.
[2:42:01] AllyCaatt: still to this day I haven’t touched ranked

[3:22:28] TorqueBandit: thats such a good point
[3:22:34] BiSettual: How much damage did Diana tank?
[3:22:39] luinardo: I don't like lethality briar they always think they're invincible. Atleast go somewhat tank.
[3:22:50] kreumbly: who wasnt winning with grace i didnt see
[3:22:50] TorqueBandit: that makes me less frustrated lol, thank you
[3:22:54] TepenTamot: LOVE ON TOP THOOO IS SO FIRE!!!!
[3:23:10] doralunaket: these people should be researched by some sociology alumni Kappa
[3:23:11] TepenTamot: nvm thats my own music playing mb
[3:23:36] shedfirekid1: i'd love to see that message in game XD
[3:23:38] TorqueBandit: official riot should send messages like that
[3:23:43] Loksdead: true lul
[3:23:56] padampadamm: hi kayyyy
[3:24:07] kreumbly: @KayPea It wild to me that people dont read the ToS they accept lol. If they did they would know saying things like "gg ez" or "ez af" and stuff in all chat is against ToS xD
[3:24:08] ZeroNamity: do you have any advice on how to fix bad mmr losing more than you gain?
[3:24:20] backstreetalright: Diana is no joke kaypCreep
[3:24:28] darjar12: @ZeroNamity create a new account

[3:25:26] ericaborgest: Hopefully last game will be a dub kaypHarmony kaypHarmony
[3:25:45] kreumbly: @TorqueBandit Yup, doing things like that or flaming enemies in all chat is against ToS, just the same as flaming allies and stuff.
[3:25:49] luinardo: I've had the same experience on weekends!!!
[3:26:07] BiSettual: The game has so much burst, yesterday I got one shot by Pantheon support like what
[3:26:13] SeaOfKiLLeR: riot said: their is no loser queue but i dont believe that
[3:26:14] doralunaket: match made in hell i guess

[3:27:10] ericaborgest: Yeh
[3:27:47] alonerebell: who iss hotguy6pack?? xdddd
[3:27:57] doralunaket: meanwhile the riot team: what should we add to gain extra money Kappa
[3:28:08] Hymuno: that's why you just buy a skin before you did promos to improve your matchmaking
[3:28:08] shedfirekid1: I just got back in to league because of your stream. even when I roll half the team just cant function
[3:28:12] MelonDestiny: I know broxah said lethality briar was nefed like a week or two ago
[3:28:17] Jimbaloney: OOGA BOOGA!!! been awhile c:
[3:28:47] kreumbly: You can tell when its a riot employee xD they put "riot" in their name. No one else can put Riot in front of their name.
[3:29:30] rivkahwastaken: luxluxluxlux widepeepoHappy
[3:29:40] DobrevBobi: I think most newer players are caught into the solo performance idea and they lack the vision of what teamwork is suppose to look like.
[3:29:42] rivkahwastaken: oh nvm Sadge
[3:29:43] doralunaket: the secret weapon is unlocked
[3:29:48] bombsnb: I love league it just has so many different things that need to change a lil but try n keep your mindset clean and it will hopefully spread out to other players
[3:30:07] lun4tic_13: No lux no bird? r u even KP ? :P
[3:30:07] ZeroNamity: i think you are the only creator i watch that actually grinds solo queue, how do you manage  playing 1v10 LUL
[3:30:13] shedfirekid1: prediction time!
[3:30:14] Loksdead: i think u are a ahri aurelion lux karma malz
[3:30:18] luinardo: Would you ever join the dark side and become an assassin player just to win?
[3:30:28] Terhadalas: No lux? Who tf are you?
[3:30:31] steelkore: kaypRonin kaypRonin kaypFreya kaypFreya
[3:30:40] kreumbly: @bombsnb thats cause they watch players like Gosu, SRO and others who give up after like 3 deaths and 15 minutes
[3:30:42] doralunaket: I love seeing ronin at the back
[3:31:09] kendren25: And they see individual players celebrated, not teams
[3:31:10] doralunaket: look at freya also so cuuuute
[3:31:12] dagger_mommy: im on the dark side xD its not as easy as u think
[3:31:18] DobrevBobi: Id rather become Bard top than joining the dark side :)

[3:33:31] ericaborgest: Cass main this season kaypH5
[3:33:37] DobrevBobi: @KayPea I also think people got too tunnel vision of trying to make smolder work in bot lane. I personally think smolder is much better mid/top laner
[3:34:08] itsJellyKateTimeBells: kaypFreya
[3:34:10] backstreetalright: your cass is good ngl
[3:34:25] kreumbly: yeah smolder is really strong if built right. Just cant build typical adc. have to build bruiser or tank. bruiser/tank smolder is a menace
[3:34:48] doralunaket: you can tell a midlaner is playing well when they know when to go back

[3:45:18] doralunaket: mama dragon couldnt help
[3:45:27] FiveFM: "Cass farming"... yeah because there was ZERO need to start a fight in the mid-lane BARD!
