[0:41:37] girthnificent: "they"
[0:41:45] thelimitlessdemon: No no they didn't kill the graves ashe killed him
[0:41:52] kijitaki: you lose that fight anyway even if he recalls, graves is lvl 4 and kayn is 3
[0:41:54] kijitaki: on recall
[0:41:54] ShaamySensei: d
[0:41:57] raulvdps: ooooh

[0:42:34] haad91: @kijitaki Doesn't need to fight, he just wanted kayn to be there to he could push the wave and potentially base
[0:42:37] hallcat13: X
[0:42:40] raulvdps: the kled chilling
[0:42:40] 1DavyJones_: press X
[0:42:44] toofaraway500: clueless jgl
[0:42:50] raulvdps: XDDD
[0:43:04] raulvdps: damn the lux
[0:43:12] variicarry: @Naayil the problem is that he dosent cover or foul clear into top neather to panish ignite top
[0:43:14] thelimitlessdemon: Kiji I know you're trying to play devil's advocate here but even you can't defend kayn. This jg just bad it horrendous he is clueless
[0:43:16] krowsa2: where is ashe
[0:43:24] mfs_nasa: is he even a jg?
[0:43:26] blasphemat: sereš
[0:43:34] hallcat13: show his games
[0:43:40] armaanxakx: Junglers always prioritize their camps
[0:43:43] einfachyusi: kayn otps classic
[0:43:46] Ramiesel: play dota
[0:43:50] wybeof: i would say supp gap
[0:43:54] krowsa2: but bro he had whole jg up on blue side. and nothing in red side
[0:43:55] raulvdps: suicide like a sion
[0:43:55] beneheimpel: Watch his Match Historie
[0:44:02] kijitaki: @kijitaki he completely loses jungle afterwards, i understand toplane pov i play both toplane and jungle but both plays could be either good or bad
[0:44:02] MrFaby69: @Naayil sup u cutie
[0:44:03] sadkatto: GIGACHAD FirstTimeChadder bye
[0:44:07] sbreed_1: what did i miss?
[0:44:07] toofaraway500: get him banned thats the only advice
[0:44:09] sonoftopboysnik2: cant tell been there how to get there, sorry cant teach , i aint challenger lmao
[0:44:10] sadkatto: obvious bait xdd
[0:44:13] pichulagorda33: Pick ad sion tu push the whole wave with a q
[0:44:14] SirKrall2: if a champ has enough damage and they one shot the stacked wave at their tower, will the next wave make it to enemy tower in time?
[0:44:18] beneheimpel: pls watch kayn match historie
[0:44:19] variicarry: @Naayil dont expect anything from your teamates is a good start XD
[0:44:20] hallcat13: Show his match history
[0:44:31] mfs_nasa: maybe kayn knows but forgot XD
[0:44:32] raulvdps: @pichulagorda33 1000 iq
[0:44:33] noct1s1: try duo and bring 1 jungle
[0:44:40] armaanxakx: Maybe he doesnt play jungle
[0:44:48] DJENT_tv: @Naayil as a top laner, u understand waves and matchups better... wdym?
[0:44:52] wybeof: maybe you play aatrox jung offstream
[0:44:56] beneheimpel: legit aatrox biggest weakness is waveclearing
[0:45:00] thelimitlessdemon: BECAUSE YOU GOT EXPERIENCE AND COMMON SENSE. sadly these jg players don't have common sense or a working brain
[0:45:00] krowsa2: if he came on top = lvl3 kayn vs  lvl 4-5 graves on top
[0:45:03] kijitaki: kayn was for sure terrible i saw he cleared blue and just ran around doing nothing, but if he does blue side its okay, if he recalls and goes topside its okay its really 5050

[0:45:05] catform22: f ?
[0:45:14] swisslion2806: @krowsa2 both graves and kayn killed 3 camps before graves died he could only walk top side so graves COULDNT invade kayn so kayn could help naayil push recal and then go kill his blue side
[0:45:21] GriffinPRO: they will never know! how would they know?
[0:45:27] jester86: 5 min of dantes in ur him now

[0:45:36] jaba_the_boar: @krowsa2 top has prio `he could buy  and he has mnore gold for getting a kill
[0:45:36] abdullah3rd: Will u play aatrox jg if they buffed it like brand?

[0:46:16] beneheimpel: and if aatrox jgl is better then top ?
[0:46:27] thelimitlessdemon: And thats why riot punishes you with shit rand teammates
[0:46:30] shinsora_: naayil wouldnt lethality aatrox be better for aatrox jungle with yoomu and this shit
[0:46:39] beneheimpel: yeah but if they buff them
[0:46:42] hallcat13: Guys suggest me any adc streamer
[0:46:46] armaanxakx: Why do u play him
[0:46:55] beneheimpel: yes
[0:47:03] jester86: @hallcat13 humzh
[0:47:05] swisslion2806: Like aatrox dmg buff on camps?
[0:47:06] raulvdps: jg>top?
[0:47:07] oooommmmeeerrr: @Naayil should i keep building leathlity bruiser hybrid aatrox or stick to a bruiser build?
[0:47:13] swisslion2806: Q dmg buff*
[0:47:20] krowsa2: @krowsa2 graves had buy too
[0:47:27] armaanxakx: Just play jungle
[0:47:48] shinsora_: that will never happen tho
[0:47:52] thelimitlessdemon: It would be too OP
[0:47:55] markojim7: aatrox guide s14 when?
[0:48:01] variicarry: @Naayil just give him some monster dmg on q and hes fine
[0:48:04] thelimitlessdemon: Aatrox already feels too broken
[0:48:05] armaanxakx: Isnt Jg and Supp harder macro wise?
[0:48:05] krowsa2: @swisslion2806 but after that push graves already lvl up i think
[0:48:05] abdullah3rd: It is meta in wr aatrox jg
[0:48:11] swisslion2806: They did it to zed
[0:48:13] beneheimpel: Even if jgl is Brocken i hate this Lane
[0:48:17] krowsa2: and graves can invade him on his rapotrs
[0:48:17] beneheimpel: ist so boring
[0:48:48] end_lass: Aatrox on jungle would be so gooodd
[0:49:03] swisslion2806: @krowsa2 it doesnt matter the red sides timerw are both the same so kayn could clear hlue side and head straight top side to clear raptors red and krugs again
[0:49:06] vildo158: jg is so fun
[0:49:10] armaanxakx: PvE lane OMEGALUL
[0:49:15] thelimitlessdemon: He already heals like insane, his speed on his ultimate feels cheating. Aatrox literally can 1v5 after getting ahead in game
[0:49:20] vildo158: I was top main but i think is so boring in top
[0:49:22] veigarbotline: Do u think u can upgrade a silver account to diamónd in 200 games?
[0:49:25] tommmmmmassssss: ur comp is so shit its not even funny
[0:49:27] krowsa2: @swisslion2806 what
[0:49:46] vildo158: but everyone have different fun lanes
[0:49:49] abdullah3rd: Jg is the true 1v9 role its the only role that can 1v9 consistantly
[0:49:55] WaddlesGMS: WaddlesGMS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! is there any way to counter side laners like yone & fiora once they get Death's Dance? that item is just ridiculous vs aatrox I feel...
[0:50:15] variicarry: @Naayil so true man is sad
[0:50:17] thelimitlessdemon: Jg role is the most ”Impactful” role in the game, its easiest to climb on the jg role
[0:50:31] vildo158: abdullah3rd:   u my mab bro
[0:50:35] armaanxakx: 07 Team comp
[0:50:38] beneheimpel: sad thing is its a Game and a Game should be fun but if u rlly wanna be god u have to Play broken things like jgl what is not fun at all

[1:17:39] cullinggameshibuyaarc: zues said he started the lethality build because he didnt know how to play the drain tank bruiser aatrox
[1:17:45] swisslion2806: @zarcuz01 both of them outscale aatrox darius is kind of a skill matchup til 4 items after that its darius favored
[1:17:50] shinsora_: pachio23 ????
[1:17:52] Zarcuz01: is darius and yone are hard matchups for aatrox? because i always win lane against him with these champs
[1:17:53] shinsora_: weirdo
[1:17:57] zedol__: yeah if you watch like zeus play aatrox he builds lethality just oneshots entire team

[1:18:56] maeshughes3: no, thank u, dont give my teammates ideas
[1:19:01] pachio23: aatrox best build is lethality in both
[1:19:05] abdullah3rd: Yone matchup next patch is easier for us with lethal tempo nerf
[1:19:14] mycomian: you're allowed to play lethality aatrox if your midlaner is faker PepeLaugh
[1:19:22] pachio23: @abdullah3rd u forgot about the compensatino buffs after 2 hours
[1:19:29] xx312lowxx: its not nerfed its gutted
[1:19:29] swisslion2806: @zarcuz01 but as naayil said they are not hard its just that they outscale aatrox like most top laners
[1:19:41] pachio23: the rune is dog shit after the nerf
[1:19:53] yavuzsultan_selim: I'm the god killer
[1:20:10] abdullah3rd: @pachio23 what buff ? Do they actually want to buff him?

[1:20:26] pachio23: they want to nerf lethal tempo and then buff yone
[1:20:47] Zarcuz01: @swisslion2806 i guess its just in gold people who play aatrox arent good tbh cuz i win by spacing them thats all

[1:26:24] Alkaline_Edge: stormsurge is literally useless item, which is a shame bc it was fun when it was strong
[1:26:32] snek1356: In my humble opinion they should nerf items that give more than 5% bonus ms, or make them unique.

[1:28:19] jad3sta: and thats the thing he deal more damage than aatrox
[1:28:22] Rotor41: Aatrox is the strongest when he doesnt do anything in lane and not getting a lead Kappa

[1:58:53] cheerios20203: ı got stomped by one last month

[1:59:24] 3lawy0_0: why u dont frezze when u ahaid ?
[1:59:32] Juli7605: @cheerios20203 thats a bit harder dodge q and you can fight ig
[1:59:33] 3lawy0_0: ahead *

[1:59:51] random67596: was fiora one of those who committed 9/11?
[1:59:53] oaz63: @kaagaroo I think if you can dodge the 3 q trundle go all thw way
[2:00:05] cheerios20203: @Juli7605 Yeah i couldn't trade with him for my life :D
[2:00:12] Migiccc: Freezing is shit on aatrox
[2:00:16] manticoreww: vs Nasus?
[2:00:19] Xenell_: depends if you want to bully more
[2:00:23] Mayuuu_0: @3lawy0_0 lets waste turret gold for freezing
[2:00:25] nime29: in bot lane freezing is extend win
[2:00:40] sbreed_1: okay bro sometimes its good relax xd
[2:00:42] ozimonn: !build
[2:00:43] Tak0Salvaje: Even if you want to set a gank, isn't bouncing the lane just straight better?
[2:00:48] 3lawy0_0: no its worth when u deny 60 cs :) and kill + take wuttert after kill
[2:00:50] Juli7605: @nime29 thats bullshit
[2:00:54] cheerios20203: @Naayil Against yone i always stand there :D
[2:00:58] kaagaroo: @kaagaroo well trundle outscales aatrox for sure, and wins in a fist fight but a good aatrox piss stomps on trundle in lane and can build a lead to win the rest
[2:01:03] 3lawy0_0: turret *
[2:01:04] capt_grass: nah you gotta freeze in mid lane so the enemy kata rage roams and double kills ur bot lane
[2:01:04] PoUwUer: at least bell vet is getting fed now

[2:01:32] sbreed_1: u can freeze for bully and then slowpush for dive
[2:01:37] TheHidj: having prio > freezing ?
[2:01:39] capt_grass: @maeshughes3 pro different game than solo q
[2:01:43] LeosDV: @hilyer1 Theres a flaw in that logic, its always worth dying to unfreeze, or in higher elos human junglers help unfreezzing, no one will stay and lose 60 cs, thats only real in low elo
[2:01:49] vedzoid: What if you’re winning but weakside
[2:01:55] Juli7605: @nime29 if you play botlane and you are ahead you should play for turrets with long range
[2:02:02] Tak0Salvaje: Is like people wanting to go 1/3/1 when they are giga ahead instead of goiing 5 man for the win
[2:02:02] solo_extremo: if im behind and my opponent start freeze, its ok, i just go proxy. xd

[2:06:54] PoUwUer: she really wanted to recall here........
[2:07:14] PoUwUer: lol
[2:07:17] cheerios20203: @Ogolikus1982 funny enough the only time i kill yone 1v1  is early game
[2:07:20] thecheeseender: @cheerios20203 early game only nerf
[2:07:26] capt_grass: yone yas top is like dead next patch back to mid lane they go
[2:07:29] cheerios20203: late game 1 missed q or spacing mistake he just straight up all ins me

[3:24:10] IEatLamas: Illaoi and yorick are just stupid to play against but you'll win against them

[3:25:14] TT_DodgeThis: i think the problem with illaoi is that i kinda whant to by exe for 800 gold plus sky for 3200 right? but she need only 2700 for her main item and thats it

[6:45:11] OskarG88: @OskarG88 idk
[6:45:19] Darke0_o: same build boring items repetition of op champs
[6:45:21] zedol__: @Masaker444 maybe learn a tank or something but champ pool not that important until super high elo
[6:45:33] Air_Agu: no items worked for aatrox besides ravenous and eclipse shojin last season
[6:45:44] patrick1_bateman2: i feel like aatrox as a champ isnt that broken just the isynergy w/ tems (goredrinker, sundered sky), thoughts?
[6:45:44] zedol__: @Masaker444 i mean look at naayil
[6:45:49] bang_bros_1: goredrinker build felt boring af
[6:45:53] Masaker444: @zedol__ y most people i asked said doesnt matter this 2 is enough t oget  to high elo
[6:46:06] patrick1_bateman2: right
[6:46:08] owosilver: you nerf the items
[6:46:10] jaig24: Is fiora less broken this season?
[6:46:11] owosilver: ye
[6:46:18] owosilver: items in the game are so dumb rn
[6:46:19] patrick1_bateman2: exactly my thoughts
[6:46:20] Masaker444: @zedol__ im just unlucky with laners who solo die before i do 3 camps n flame me lol
[6:46:25] quckquckk: what when you would build aatrox full attack speed woudnt that be good ?
[6:46:26] Air_Agu: i miss shojin aatrox
[6:46:28] Komlin111: dont do the sejauni
[6:46:32] Verrierrr: there are other item users though
[6:46:38] Lillucas082: is Aatrox actually considered op rn?
[6:46:40] Verrierrr: you cna't nerf them will nilly
[6:46:42] firetex_live: @naayil have u Seen the renekton buff? 10% more healing on Q?
[6:46:55] kira_tz13: I honestly dont get why people care too much about item diversity, who cares if some champs have core 3 items like idk
[6:47:16] pan_con_chicharr0n: @jaig24 just early game bc divine being removed but shes still broken late game
[6:47:16] zedol__: @Masaker444 idk might be bad to play 2 champs with completely diff playstyles and wincons but other than that
[6:47:23] smart595: the item just made for aatrox
[6:47:28] Komlin111: the mixed pen and pre mitigation healing was op
[6:47:33] salega96: they removed mythics and still fucked up items somehow
[6:47:40] zedol__: @Masaker444 but like if you played elise and lee that would prob be better bc they have similar gameplan
[6:47:41] Darke0_o: xin zhao is pretty good with sundered sky
[6:47:51] Masaker444: @zedol__ i almost only play yi elise i pick when they are full cc or we need ap
[6:48:08] Masaker444: @zedol__ yeah i see might play some lee
[6:48:18] owosilver: good on xin, aatrox, illaoi maybe?. there are very few champs that can utilize it very well
[6:48:24] Komlin111: TOPMAIN
[6:48:29] zedol__: @Masaker444 yeah lee hella fun too
[6:48:38] bang_bros_1: sunderer disgusting on illaoi too
[6:48:44] H4LUCYN: show runes pls
[6:48:47] chievl: what makes illaoi op items ? or stats
[6:48:48] YAZ1KUN: tenacity rune better than hp?
[6:48:50] kira_tz13: So you just dodge when you dont get aatrox?
[6:48:55] owosilver: @chievl items
[6:48:55] patrick1_bateman2: @chievl tentacle buff
[6:48:59] Komlin111: @chievl passive healing and items
[6:49:10] owosilver: they changed sundered illaoi interaction
[6:49:16] zedol__: @Masaker444 if you gonna stick with yi tho prob better to have another scaling hypercarry as ur secondary
[6:49:21] olikn0: wait what
[6:49:27] olikn0: what does unflinching do then
[6:49:32] patrick1_bateman2: season 13 syndra Aware
