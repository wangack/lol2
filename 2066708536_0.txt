[2:18:09] what_head: she has a spammable scruby move
[2:18:40] ImmotileEpidemic: While standing are while rising moves they just use ws because wr is taken by while running

[2:20:32] what_head: she is
[2:20:33] KMotionn: she is op
[2:20:43] Rikuball: she is best character in the game imo
[2:20:48] 3NIGHTFURY3: what are the odds u play with qt today
[2:20:53] Zaamch: why are we looking at tekken characters i need to know pepeMeltdown
[2:20:54] morpheus7078: that long list of pros KEKW

[2:21:10] macklin2001: the guide literally says "Jin’s mom has got it going on"
[2:21:51] dewidewidewi: @macklin2001 baseg
[2:21:55] Wriggles_Lantern: feels like lichbane should be a core item for kassa

[2:22:38] SomeAsianDood: Lee is HARD to play
[2:22:42] Wriggles_Lantern: too complex
[2:22:42] combowombowombo: stance characters are harder in general
[2:22:43] what_head: @Zaamch hes going to save na in evo
[2:22:47] TheDrikke: CH = counterhit
[2:22:49] ImmotileEpidemic: he has a bunch of evasive tools so he can be aggresive in your face and it's hard to press a button against it
[2:22:56] lolcrestfallen: think Jayce

[2:24:01] Shaldir: Just try them all instead lol
[2:24:02] lolcrestfallen: waifu character suits you best
[2:24:11] TheDrikke: you're sounding a lot like a sergei dragunov fella
[2:24:16] SickLiq: you can try them out in practice to see how they feel
[2:24:17] FrndlyDragon: play Nina FLUSH
[2:24:18] ImmotileEpidemic: Are you more of a defensive or offensive player?
[2:24:21] combowombowombo: people were saying jin is an allrounder like ken
[2:24:23] ImmotileEpidemic: Do you like 50/50's
[2:24:27] what_head: @Shaldir this is not recommended at all in tekken

[2:25:14] dedpup: you can read about oki in the glossary
[2:25:16] lolcrestfallen: you sound like a Nina player
[2:25:17] TheDrikke: plenty of characters have over 150 moves in tekken
[2:25:21] ImmotileEpidemic: each char has like 200 moves
[2:25:23] KMotionn: ya some characters are based off real martial arts
[2:25:23] ImmotileEpidemic: lol
[2:25:23] Bangoram: Tekken is the most technical of the fighters
[2:25:25] TheDrikke: danny absolutely does not sound like a nina player lmao
[2:25:28] Bangoram: so stances for days
[2:25:28] FrndlyDragon: oki is when you punish people getting up

[2:26:27] SomeAsianDood: WANGED
[2:26:30] KMotionn: i think jin would fit you
[2:26:32] lolcrestfallen: evenTRUE

[2:26:37] emilyywang: I mean cuz qt plays more and he’s not
[2:26:41] combowombowombo: BAN HER
[2:26:42] what_head: if he picks a mashima he needs to sit in lab and learn EWGF
[2:26:58] TheDrikke: i disagree, jin has the tools to not rely incredibly heavily on EWGF
[2:27:00] ImmotileEpidemic: He needs lab whoever he plays
[2:27:01] ImmotileEpidemic: lol
[2:27:05] TheDrikke: kazuya and dj on the other hand, probably
[2:27:05] KMotionn: ya
[2:27:07] FrndlyDragon: I need him to play a mishima KEKW

[2:27:12] combowombowombo: think jin is it for your playstyle
[2:27:17] FrndlyDragon: Paul isn't very brainy
[2:27:24] SomeAsianDood: It's idiot gambling yen KEKW

[2:28:58] dewidewidewi: yes yes yes ? PauseChamp
[2:29:03] isnt_rainingeclipse: planning never works with true friends
[2:29:05] Nyzard99: @Rikuball as soon as he picks a char (4-5 working days)
[2:29:07] ImmotileEpidemic: Tekken time
[2:29:13] TheDrikke: @what_head sure is, though jin has some pretty damn good wall carry straight out the box though, ch f4 alone is alrdy like "they're gonna go far"
[2:29:22] FrndlyDragon: But reina is really neat. She has enough easy things to ease you in but has a lot of advanced things that you can learn
[2:29:26] lolcrestfallen: is SF6 or Tekken 8 the better game?
[2:29:26] paininworld: Crime City Graves, you already know that he gonna smurf this game @Shiphtur
[2:29:27] FrndlyDragon: frfr

[2:30:51] dewidewidewi: froyo person greetings Looking
[2:30:52] TheDrikke: yeah don't compare it to sf6, these are VERY different type of fighters
[2:30:56] Nyzard99: @Nyzard99 OhISee
[2:30:57] pibble11: story mode :)
[2:30:59] what_head: tekken is a defensive game even with 8 being more offensive and faster

[2:31:06] froyozenyogurt: dewi person Looking
[2:31:10] NerdTheNinja: 1 game of king and u will be hooked
[2:31:11] TheDrikke: no, even king, the grappler character is wildly different from sF6's zangief
[2:31:12] KeimaGamer: But King is so cool Sadge
[2:31:19] BluntChan: FR, play story mode. its sick
[2:31:22] SickLiq: @KeimaGamer false
[2:31:26] miniWD40: Anyone know where that tekken google doc is from
[2:31:27] what_head: @BluntChan shortest move list is 60
[2:31:36] TheDrikke: @miniWD40 i linked it above

[2:31:41] Nick3570: what is with all these cringe karma mid players
[2:31:51] FrndlyDragon: not a king player LETSGO
[2:32:17] NerdTheNinja: they need the range cuz u too good
[2:32:24] ImmotileEpidemic: lmao
[2:32:27] Nightbot: Join My Discord Server! discord.gg/shiphtur
[2:32:35] SomeAsianDood: @lolcrestfallen if you have tekken experience its easier to pick up tekken
[2:32:46] Rikuball: still waiting for the ezreal supports
[2:32:50] echo_owo: hes gonna play karma next game to bully the enemy jg
[2:32:57] SomeAsianDood: tekken movelists have legacy, but require alot of knowledge, so if you have some to start it helps alot
[2:33:01] dedpup: @lolcrestfallen what youve practiced in t7 will translate to t8 very well, street fighter you can pick up and play for fun with a couple hours practice like in training and tutorial mode
[2:34:22] dewidewidewi: kayn relax my good friend youre gonna get limited in your pinging!!
[2:34:34] BluntChan: whaaaaaaaat
[2:34:37] TheDrikke: @lolcrestfallen depends on what you mean by "ypu played tekken solo" as in online experience fighting other ppl? or messing around vs ai
[2:34:38] Rikuball: its over
[2:34:38] ImmotileEpidemic: how did he mess that up?
