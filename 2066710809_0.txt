[3:08:06] treeboiy: of the next attack hit @chocco_icecream
[3:08:06] skitter_bb: if you hit with an ability before the heart is full you just do a little more damage. if you hit with an ability after heart is full it charms, does more damage and reduces MR

[3:12:52] TheSkydOGe: Did you know: Evelynn has invisibility? Kappa
[3:14:07] chocco_icecream: @SailorPluto9 @SailorPluto9 i didnt
[3:14:31] skitter_bb: @ffa_argos I was replying/talking to Chocco Icecream who asked how Eve W worked
[3:15:15] chocco_icecream: what even is her E btw i thought it was invisibility but now i see that's her passive
[3:15:43] TheSkydOGe: oh yo that aatrox is pobelter lol
[3:15:45] GusWarlock_: what skin is that?
[3:16:29] skitter_bb: E is a targeted dash+damage ability where if it's glowing like it is now it's enhanced and does %hp damage (it gets enhanced when you turn invisible/your passive is active), and if not it just does some magic damage. Either way it applies On Hit, like Lich Bane
[3:16:41] Nightbot: join chaseshaco's discord using the link https://discord.gg/chaseshaco
[3:17:06] skitter_bb: Passive is the invisibility (only post level 6) and while it is active you heal your hp semi-rapidly up to a certain point based on AP scaling
[3:17:27] TheSkydOGe: wtf are they doing lmao

[5:18:45] prnmeds: are you able to speak on it objectively? Do you guys play with different playstyles? Do you see anything in his gameplay that leans towards what you like, does he find success prioritizing things taht you don't look to?
[5:18:48] acesilverdude: are you growing the beard out ?
[5:20:06] prnmeds: im just thankful for shaco content, from both of you
[5:20:18] SxualPenguin: what skill do you need to flourish in fiesta games that differs to the skill needed in quality games
[5:20:49] prnmeds: i mean youre both challenger players though right? like top 0.1% of all players or whatever that means
[5:21:03] prnmeds: so is it just peoples obsession with finding who is THE BEST shaco?

[5:23:05] ClassicGazza: @prnmeds You say that, yet you're in both streams telling pom everything chase is saying xD
[5:23:32] ltheblankl: the argument for best shaco is entirely controversial across multiple servers. the title for best is just a publicity stunt at this point
[5:23:34] prnmeds: @ClassicGazza I don't think I went and told anyone what anyone was saying?
[5:24:08] MusicaXIX: I gotchu, man! Always supporting my friend's is what I do.
[5:24:26] prnmeds: oh that isnt true, I actually typed "it seems like he respects you as a player" my bad :D
