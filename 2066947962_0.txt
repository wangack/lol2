[2:18:30] DARKMAMBA20: I think after champions who can summon monsters and mobs die, their mobs should still be allowed to free roam or be commanded
[2:18:44] DARKMAMBA20: like Annie fibbers, yorick maiden and ivern daisy

[2:25:23] DARKMAMBA20: someone should get the shield reaver item, its a shielding comp willl reduce shields by 20 percent

[2:27:02] DARKMAMBA20: 35 percent wtf\
[2:27:09] DARKMAMBA20: reduces 35 percent not 20
[2:27:17] Aaylas: that item is terrible, I think

[3:56:16] m0k3tAl1ty: gottem
[3:57:18] wilsonao: Janna mains are always coomers
[3:58:08] m0k3tAl1ty: i also feel like since the atk speed starts when you press r the 1st time, a good bit of it is wasted by time you actually fly to whoever you're trying to hit
[3:58:30] Maqqee: it resets when you land your ult also
[4:00:07] mormonsoakerttv: i didnt know you were a navy vet im active right now
[4:02:23] m0k3tAl1ty: off to a good start
[4:02:39] Wiznatts: i feel like its a pretty good start when 2 lanes get kills before gromp goes down lol
[4:03:36] thelonesurvivordied: !comps
[4:03:36] StreamElements: Set 10 Comp List  https://imgur.com/a/BdlH94V

[4:08:15] woopo1: its actually his first time jungle
[4:08:18] DarkRedux: Its the part that they lose their own lane in 5 minutes and blame the noc pre 6
[4:08:19] DarkRedux: like
[4:08:21] DarkRedux: nice
[4:09:03] wilsonao: Kat so scared

[4:11:18] chernoak47: Tragic game haha
[4:11:39] chernoak47: This is why I play TFT XD
[4:11:42] Wiznatts: i feel like to play jungle you need to be a licensed psychologist to keep 3 lanes' mentals from imploding
[4:17:08] wilsonao: Go next kinda game
[4:17:35] wilsonao: Lmao
[4:20:34] wilsonao: You forget she is insane

[4:22:03] Surpriseigloo: only playing around kalista maybe
[4:22:09] Surpriseigloo: mid and top seem tilted af.
[4:22:36] drevas: This is pretty much like the last game just the enemy team is running it smiteLaugh
[4:23:26] Wiznatts: im surprised autoing a ward consumes the passive auto
[4:24:20] Surpriseigloo: fio doing well with the split at least.
[4:24:53] m0k3tAl1ty: i get back and things have definitely turned around from the 2 kills before you even kill gromp
[4:24:56] Wiznatts: kinda unfortunate that naut is perma grey screen sim
[4:25:11] Surpriseigloo: only giving mid isn't bad there.
[4:26:11] Surpriseigloo: considering how fast everyone is dying? Yeah ocean soul isn't the diff here.
[4:26:35] Surpriseigloo: lol why did she walk up to auth
[4:26:39] m0k3tAl1ty: i think vlad is really only one on their team who super benefits from ocean soul
[4:26:40] Surpriseigloo: *auto
[4:26:42] Surpriseigloo: ggs
[4:26:46] Surpriseigloo: was a long shot anyways
[4:26:52] wilsonao: MVP is enemy team mid tower
[4:27:27] Surpriseigloo: for last play? Peeling kalista was the biggest thing
[4:27:35] Wiznatts: i don't know if you should have but kat def expected you to lol
[4:27:36] wilsonao: Fiora was gonna find something to rage about
[4:27:55] Surpriseigloo: yeah you weren't making that play.
[4:28:08] wilsonao: And kat was l.. ooof.... And bot was gonzo mode
[4:28:43] Surpriseigloo: I hate trying for early kills if it's not guaranteed. Especially against any jg that is strong countering.
[4:29:14] Surpriseigloo: yeah Kat flash, and naut walk up, RIP.
[4:30:49] Surpriseigloo: @saintvicious you consider taking ghost? Makes early kills easier.
[4:32:15] Surpriseigloo: it's comp dependent, but it can work shruge
[4:32:18] BuffJesus: Ye but back in season 1 when ghost was 3x better with 80s CD Kappa
[4:33:05] Surpriseigloo: Speaks to being good into specific comps. You wouldn't take it into every matchup, clearly.
[4:33:26] forsake23: peepoRClap
[4:33:27] saintvicious: thank you for the input chatter

[4:34:21] Wiznatts: bad
[4:35:24] Wiznatts: (i'll take snowball ghost on some aram noct tho xD)
[4:36:21] Wiznatts: good name for the rune page tbh
[4:37:02] Lennurd: let's see it
[4:37:24] Wiznatts: resist the voices
[4:40:54] johnsmith37: not even close
[4:41:03] WhyWorry07: calculated
[4:41:43] johnsmith37: mental boom
[4:41:43] WhyWorry07: acrual trolling
[4:41:46] Wiznatts: most stable master yi player tbh
[4:41:46] Riketzz: have you done teemo support yet? is that any good?
[4:42:20] Wiznatts: he didn't even ping to go did he?
[4:43:24] Ryance: both :)
[4:43:31] forsake23: why not both KEKW
[4:48:01] slumzzz: yea they are supposed to be on my team :)
[4:48:05] WhyWorry07: mentally stable league players are a myth LUL
[4:50:06] dyst0piax: xdd
[4:50:57] Ryance: imagine playing a game for fun :)
[4:52:09] johnsmith37: peepoRun
[4:52:34] LordAudacity: I mean they play because they are relatively good at it and have nothing else to do
[4:52:44] johnsmith37: every yi player has a peanut brain
[4:53:00] m0k3tAl1ty: i mean, i know i'm bad at the game
[4:53:06] johnsmith37: he just run at ppl and complain about cc
[4:53:17] m0k3tAl1ty: you cant convince me otherwise
[4:53:17] woopo1: yea ive seen na lcs rosters these days challenger na doesnt even cut it from the looks of it
[4:53:31] Wiznatts: i feel like if your definition of good at the game says there are 0 good people on a continent
[4:53:36] Indervoir: NA should only play tft i think OMEGALUL
[4:53:38] Wiznatts: then that might be a bit narrow
[4:53:44] ConnorBedardSzn: how embarrassing is it I can't climb out of silver
[4:53:49] Partybar: honestly its just better to play the game muted
[4:53:57] LordAudacity: Masters is still like the top 5% right
[4:54:16] woopo1: no way its top 5%? wasnt diamond top 2% for the longest time
[4:54:29] Guario29: % of hundreds of thousands of players pogO
[4:54:44] wilsonao: I am top 5% in my neighborhood
[4:55:16] slumzzz: -10%
[4:55:28] globenstine: less than %1 for sure.
[4:55:42] wilsonao: Like at least 2% of the player base are housepets at least
[4:56:16] LordAudacity: These people are like giants to the average player I think
[4:56:31] LordAudacity: at least in their mind
[4:56:40] LordAudacity: and they get off to that
[4:57:11] globenstine: its called dunning kruger syndrome.
[4:58:03] tee_palm: rock... and... stone
[4:58:35] angahax: but the people that troll like that should be banned
[4:58:37] m0k3tAl1ty: surely next game will be better
[4:58:40] globenstine: that type of behavior is why i no longer play mobas.
[4:58:47] woopo1: i wouldve been pretty happy with masters ngl
[4:59:06] angahax: I get banned for trolling in chat these mother fuckers troll the actual game
[4:59:14] angahax: and nothing happens
[5:00:06] Partybar: so no one is good?
[5:00:19] LordAudacity: i think Rank does have some symbolism of skill
[5:00:22] globenstine: with enough games statistically a house cat can hit masters.
[5:01:47] LordAudacity: I think it’s crazy to say rank has 0 to do with skill
[5:02:41] Sheshantol: you can be rank 1 and be terrible at the game
[5:02:51] Tacobowl8: My thoughts on player skill are that I think players of all skill can be fun to watch as a viewer.
[5:02:58] Partybar: but high school basketball players are better than the WNBA
[5:03:17] woopo1: high school basketball is ugly bro they shoot like 30% from the field

[5:03:35] CheckYorSix: seriously
[5:03:40] LordAudacity: Nah
[5:03:42] darth_ted: the womans national soccer team got wrecked by a high school boys team, but its a completely different game
[5:03:50] CheckYorSix: They havent
[5:03:50] LordAudacity: WNBA sucks
[5:03:50] Wiznatts: the us women's national team for soccer played a friendly against some rando hs team and got blow out
[5:03:52] BleachIceCream: you dont like senna seraphine ?
[5:03:54] globenstine: well high school soccer is DEFINATLEY better than the womens soccer team and they proved it LUL
[5:04:13] BleachIceCream: senna is so broken
[5:04:18] XiaoPan1987: illus2Hmm
[5:04:23] woopo1: the most elite high school basketball playes would win. that go to prep schools and all that but not your random local high school
[5:04:25] CheckYorSix: Dude, the world cup female USA team lost to to the 15 year old C string boys from a random high school in soccer
[5:04:33] SwissSW: A while back I read an article about the, like, ex men's college players who are practice partners for WNBA teams
[5:04:34] CheckYorSix: So no, WNBA would not beat male high school players
[5:04:38] Partybar: a good HS boys team would dominate the WNBA man
[5:04:55] Wiznatts: i think you take every state championship team for hs basketball an they run a wbna all star team out of the gym
[5:04:59] woopo1: wnba players are way more skilled tho

[5:05:40] Partybar: i agree with you just giving yo ua hard time with your analyogy
[5:05:47] globenstine: so your saying its like kevin durant playing against a fat high school kid?
[5:05:51] Wiznatts: yeah you just picked a bad example lol
[5:05:57] marco90s: It's like comparing super rich people and a random millionaire guy
[5:06:06] SwissSW: The dudes who declare for the draft right out of high school are really really abnormal for high school though
[5:06:20] Wiznatts: thats not a workable definition of good tho
[5:06:22] woopo1: you cant declare for the draft out of highschool
[5:06:23] kamikazi_34: i love when national womens soccer/hockey teams lose to like U15 boys teams 7-0
[5:06:28] woopo1: you guys dont even watch basketball
[5:06:30] XiaoPan1987: Top Highschool players, yes.  An ordinary highschool team.  Hell no.
[5:06:31] LordAudacity: lol that’s “good”
[5:06:34] キマロド: i thought they couldnt do that anymore anyway, dont they have to play a year in college for eligibility for the nba draft?
[5:06:41] SwissSW: or they can go to australia
[5:06:42] Wiznatts: elite is not synonymous with good
[5:06:56] LordAudacity: tell him wiz
[5:06:57] Partybar: bro chat is gonna tilt you
[5:06:58] globenstine: yes
[5:06:58] OccultSquid: The US Women's national team didn't lose to a random high school. They lost to a MLS academy team. There is a difference there. Those are top 1% of high school players that are in the pipeline to become professionals. That's not representative of high school soccer.
[5:07:08] XiaoPan1987: ^
[5:07:11] LordAudacity: yes
[5:07:14] Ryance: LOOOOL
[5:07:18] globenstine: if your good enough to be on tv your good
[5:07:18] darth_ted: i think you are good...
[5:07:20] CheckYorSix: @XiaoPan1987 an ordinary Junior squad of high school boys BEAT the top multiple winning womens soccer team in the world as a BLOW OUT
[5:07:23] XiaoPan1987: Like a whole team of Kobe out of Highschool players they could.
[5:07:26] mdiesel394: it's like a top college football team playing an NFL team. You would say that the college team was shit even though statistically they're some of the best in the world at football
[5:07:27] Sheshantol: 4th place team in LCS is good though Aware
[5:07:38] XiaoPan1987: But outside of that.  No Highschooler team is beating WNBA
[5:07:43] XiaoPan1987: PepeLaugh
[5:07:50] Athkata: You're always top tier in my heart baby
[5:07:52] LordAudacity: they are shit compared to elite, but they are good
[5:07:59] globenstine: your shit? i thought your name was saint tho? Kappa
[5:08:17] SwissSW: Does some dude who plays utility infield 40 games a year and bats .200 for a 100 loss MLB team count as good or no
[5:08:27] Wiznatts: yes
[5:08:38] SwissSW: I think he does too, but I figure a lot of sports fans disagree
[5:08:42] LordAudacity: a 70k car is good but shit compared to a million dollar car
[5:08:57] woopo1: saint just has higher standards of what is good i guess
[5:08:59] OccultSquid: Yes, but that player in question is better at baseball than master's level players are at LoL
[5:09:09] slumzzz: ill sell you a "good" car :)
[5:09:16] kamikazi_34: @SwissSW it depends on the population you are comparing against, against ALL players yes they are good. comparing to MLB players, no they are shit
[5:09:17] Partybar: serena williams lost to a mid 200 rank mens tennis player
[5:09:18] mdiesel394: yeah a masters level playing would be a guy playing in the low low minor leagues
[5:09:32] woopo1: do you really think serena williams isnt skilled
[5:09:35] mdiesel394: and you would not cal lthem good at basebal
[5:09:39] mdiesel394: baseball*
[5:09:43] SwissSW: yeah, is the masters guy like some 40 year old who never made it out of A ball
[5:09:46] Zedaine112: @LordAudacity not always true. sometimes you pay for name
[5:09:49] woopo1: everyone agrees men are more athletic
[5:09:55] CheckYorSix: @Partybar exactly. The williams girls don't want to play against good men because they know it's not competition
[5:09:56] mdiesel394: there are a lot of minor leagues
[5:10:03] キマロド: ehh it prob is
[5:10:06] Wiznatts: its close
[5:10:13] キマロド: there are a lot of dudes playing in amateur leagues not just minor league baseball
[5:10:16] SwissSW: the minor league system is pretty deep yeah
[5:10:23] mdiesel394: there are like 5 different low level minor leagues masters would probably be between the lowest and maybe top college level
[5:10:35] SwissSW: even deeper if you count the unaffiliated teams
[5:10:37] Zedaine112: minor league in baseball starts recruiting at like 14 years old lol
[5:10:47] Zedaine112: shits insane how early baseball is recruited
[5:10:53] Wiznatts: 32 team with 30+ guys on the roster 5 levels deep
[5:10:54] LordAudacity: baseball skill gap is insane tho
[5:10:55] SwissSW: then again there's more money in baseball than in LoL
[5:11:03] mdiesel394: they're recruiting 12 year olds in the DR
[5:11:13] Zedaine112: yeah exactly
[5:11:18] woopo1: basketball prospects start at 6 years old lmao
[5:11:18] Wiznatts: they're recruiting dominican kids who _say_ they're 12
[5:11:41] Zedaine112: no for real, they recruit very young in baseball if they see talent
[5:11:42] Wiznatts: raphael furcal was 16 telling people he was 12
[5:11:47] Zedaine112: and in the DR, baseball is the main escape
[5:11:49] キマロド: the lesson to be learned here is just dont use other sports as analogies to league of legends 4Head
[5:11:54] Wiznatts: my guy i work in baseball
[5:12:02] Wiznatts: i think i know
[5:12:08] Wiznatts: 4Head
[5:12:11] Zedaine112: then i wont argue and submit my opinion lol
[5:12:17] ronchohonchoncho: inside the baseball? Isn't it a bit cramped KappaPenis
[5:12:33] Partybar: chat is tilt
[5:12:42] woopo1: its funny because today a WNBA player shot better then 8/9 players in the allstar game 3 point contenst today. only steph curry shot better
[5:13:14] LordAudacity: it’s easy to shoot without a 6’6 dude jumping at you
[5:13:21] Zedaine112: and? shes a very good shot unguarded
[5:13:28] XiaoPan1987: I feel like 3 Point Contest is not a good indicator PepeLaugh
[5:13:32] キマロド: for real
[5:13:36] ronchohonchoncho: @LordAudacity "easy" KappaPenis
[5:13:42] キマロド: lmao dont use the allstar game as a reference for realistic stats...
[5:13:42] LightningArcher: And? She still beat the unguarded guys?
[5:13:56] woopo1: im saying wnba players are skilled your acting like highschool players who shoot 25% from the field are good
[5:14:00] Zedaine112: youre right. that's why i said she's a very good shot ungaurded lol
[5:14:02] Wiznatts: genuine question, did the women shoot with the smaller ball?
[5:14:07] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to saintvicious's community! 
[5:14:07] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to blue_magus!  
[5:14:24] LordAudacity: I bet only like 3 WNBA players could actually play in the nba
[5:14:33] woopo1: 0 wnba players could play
[5:14:42] SwissSW: I think if any of them could, they would be
[5:14:46] Wiznatts: its literally just a size issue
[5:14:57] XiaoPan1987: ^
[5:15:02] Wiznatts: average shooting guard in the nba is taller than the average wnba center
[5:15:03] cutekittycat2: oh man you think this conversation is annoying, imagine it also with chess, where there's no RNG and objective constant measuring of skill!
[5:15:06] キマロド: a 6'4 player in the nba is a tiny baby
[5:15:09] LordAudacity: it’s a physically issue too
[5:15:28] Wiznatts: chess is kinda weird
[5:15:33] LordAudacity: arguably a quickness one too
[5:15:33] SwissSW: nah chess conversations are all about theoretical exotic ways to cheat in tournaments
[5:15:42] SwissSW: thanks Hans Niemann
[5:15:43] Wiznatts: cause for basically its entire existence women were shunned from the game
[5:15:46] rolfkip: wnba nba debate is asinine
[5:15:56] Zedaine112: ^
[5:15:57] XiaoPan1987: PepeLaugh
[5:16:13] XiaoPan1987: I just like watching funny memes of poor plays in basketball
[5:17:10] woopo1: i promise you march madness is uglier basketball the the wnba and that mens college.
[5:17:19] ronchohonchoncho: Yo Saint have you watched the new episodes of Curb your Enthusiasm yet?
[5:17:47] キマロド: people dont watch the ncaa tournament for the quality of play. they watch it because they like gambling
[5:17:58] woopo1: its because they went to those schools
[5:17:58] SwissSW: or school loyalty
[5:18:15] woopo1: womens college basketball is actually more popular then the wnba right now
[5:18:36] SwissSW: yes, because Caitlin Clark superstar mania right
[5:18:52] LordAudacity: I think they are trying to push it so people will watch more WNBA
[5:19:11] キマロド: they're trying to build an organic base to market off of
[5:19:14] dyst0piax: xdd 󠀀

[5:19:17] NEZEN27: mr president
[5:19:23] XiaoPan1987: Countered xdd
[5:19:38] woopo1: its in the offseason for the nba but i still watch more fiba and euroleague but its not a terrible unskilled basketball players like people make it out to be
[5:19:52] LordAudacity: they want Caitlin Clark to save the WNBA
[5:20:09] XiaoPan1987: I'm waiting for the US Team to lose in the Olympics
[5:20:23] XiaoPan1987: mostly because NBA rules is so different internationally
[5:20:45] SwissSW: does Trinidad and Tobago have a basketball team, I want to see them hilariously pants the US national team in another sport
[5:20:56] XiaoPan1987: it's going to happen
[5:20:58] XiaoPan1987: PepeLaugh
[5:21:02] XiaoPan1987: I just feel it
[5:21:07] XiaoPan1987: or Lebron gets benched
[5:21:16] woopo1: they got 4th in fiba this year but didnt bring the best players
[5:21:22] XiaoPan1987: since that man doesn't play defense
[5:21:22] ronchohonchoncho: EoN gamer
[5:23:03] LordAudacity: I think it’s funny how Lebron doesn’t play defense is a thing people say- like no player at 39 plays defense in the regular season
[5:23:25] ronchohonchoncho: superfastmonkey pressed r
[5:23:35] woopo1: dlo and reeves are still worse defenders then a 39 yo lebron
[5:23:57] woopo1: lakers doomed
[5:24:06] LordAudacity: warriors doomed
[5:24:15] ronchohonchoncho: ks
[5:24:51] ronchohonchoncho: SwiftRage KS
[5:25:00] SwissSW: unfortunately I live in an NBA distortion field because the Bulls still insist on pretending that they're close to making a real run
[5:25:26] Wiznatts: the wolves are accidentally good this year and i don't know how to feel about it
[5:25:27] dyst0piax: I refuse to care about the bulls until jerry reinsdorf dies or sells the team
[5:25:40] LordAudacity: sorry fam @swisssw
[5:25:54] angahax: gonna be another 11k loss lol
[5:26:06] woopo1: lonzo is coming back COPIUM
[5:26:47] SwissSW: At this point I wouldn't be surprised if they hatched an elaborate scheme involving a Lonzo Ball body double
[5:27:12] ronchohonchoncho: He picked the snowflake skin to pretend he is ashe KappaPenis
[5:27:38] LordAudacity: I’m a lonzo fan
[5:28:07] ronchohonchoncho: the river ult Kreygasm
[5:28:18] キマロド: kaisa???
[5:28:38] SwissSW: yeah it's just really unfortunate when a star player has their leg explode
[5:28:44] SwissSW: this seems to happen a lot in Chicago lately
[5:29:19] ronchohonchoncho: grubs really give 3x souls as baron

[5:39:03] jacksonyee9: saint is already a dad
[5:39:04] jacksonyee9: he got kimchi
[5:39:11] DARKMAMBA20: you and your girl are in their prime to have kids. The longer you wait, the harder it will be
[5:39:18] DARKMAMBA20: and the less quality of life you can provide for it
[5:39:23] Guario29: everyone should just not have kids fk it last generation
[5:39:25] globenstine: life - kids = money
[5:39:26] DARKMAMBA20: to leave a legacy behind on earth

[5:39:41] DARKMAMBA20: cuz we are humans
[5:39:48] woopo1: basically every society needs kids come on now but not everyone needs to have the kids
[5:39:51] JesusBatman: and its or mission in life is to make babies
[5:39:51] dustangelms: Why is there a need to ask questions?
[5:39:58] Guario29: isnt it the natural human instinct
[5:40:01] Indervoir: they shouldn't, but they already đi
[5:40:01] DARKMAMBA20: well, in gods eyes, the more you procreate the better it is for the world

[5:40:44] NEZEN27: homey went from 'why no dog' to 'why not god?' real quick
[5:40:47] DARKMAMBA20: before we had technology and other desires, the number one goal we had was to breed
[5:40:47] woopo1: but its not in saints so i guess he acsended
[5:40:48] DARKMAMBA20: and have kids
[5:40:49] irspeshal: my mom said i was special too.  it's how i got my name

[5:41:34] irspeshal: @ronchohonchoncho you sure as hell are. good on you
[5:41:36] globenstine: the 13 billion human population would argue for less kids tbh
[5:41:38] DARKMAMBA20: but dont you want to see yourself in someone, and heal your inner child if you got neglected or didn't receive the best child hood
[5:41:39] Rgcommander: Saint legit question, how do you not have permanent brain damage from some of the chatters here LUL
[5:41:40] NEZEN27: "The Bronze Age ruined everything"

[5:41:53] Indervoir: @DARKMAMBA20 we are advanced animal though, we don't 100% live by instincts
[5:42:04] globenstine: HAVE YOUR HEARD ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR
[5:42:07] DARKMAMBA20: @Indervoir that's because we let society social structures break us down
[5:42:10] woopo1: i mean every society needs kids. no matter what hypothetical world you imagine. just weird that people force it
[5:42:13] carbonstylus: Ssomebody come get their boy
[5:42:15] carbonstylus: KEKW
[5:42:31] Ego_Proxy: Wait, are you saying we shouldn't have offspring to live vicariously through them so we can feel better about our lackluster lives?
[5:42:32] Rgcommander: @DARKMAMBA20 what are you using and will you share with the group
[5:42:39] Partybar: Hey Saint, what is your IQ? I took a test and mine is over 200. I know because the test was $100 and I paid for it several times to make sure.
[5:42:41] globenstine: i mean thats out of context but i agreen with the statement about social structures
[5:42:42] JesusBatman: i mean tbh to side with you @saintvicious  having kids now adays is like owning an exotic pet
[5:42:45] Indervoir: so you are saying, we MUST reproduce?
[5:42:50] LiQuiD112: have a child now
[5:42:50] DARKMAMBA20: like im all for progressing for evolution and progressing civilization.But sometimes, the old way is better than the new
[5:42:52] BleachIceCream: not everyone is meant to be a parent
[5:42:52] JesusBatman: its cheaper or equally as expensive to get a cat or dog
[5:42:53] DARKMAMBA20: just my opinion of things
[5:42:55] DARKMAMBA20: and im only 23
[5:43:00] woopo1: @JesusBatman thats cap bro. societies need kids lmao
[5:43:10] irspeshal: @ronchohonchoncho but not special enough for saint to have come to my birthday party.

[5:44:06] Indervoir: @DARKMAMBA20 there is no point for evolution w/o natural selection anyway, and we human don't go through natural selection
[5:44:09] DarkRedux: i feel ima have to mute this stream...
[5:44:16] DeBruce: existence is pain
[5:44:17] DARKMAMBA20: because they devoted their life to god

[5:44:21] DARKMAMBA20: that's an exception
[5:44:21] globenstine: they holdin out for that jesus D
[5:44:23] DARKMAMBA20: to serve christ
[5:44:24] elessar__telcontar: this convo lol
[5:44:27] ronchohonchoncho: get rekt by facts and logic
[5:44:30] DARKMAMBA20: its to serve christ
[5:44:38] tonievlol: suffering is the main state of human existence
[5:44:38] woopo1: oopsies
[5:44:40] blue_magus: LUL
[5:44:46] NEZEN27: so purposes beyond having kids exist?!
[5:44:48] konfetties: all hail sv
[5:44:50] imperialtft: where's my big mac
[5:44:54] DeBruce: Nuns are NOT christians, they are CATHOLICS, they do NOT serve Christ they serve GOD
[5:44:55] ronchohonchoncho: and we serve you
[5:44:57] tonievlol: @DARKMAMBA20 to serve cvnt
[5:44:58] SwissSW: wait, is twitch chat god
[5:44:59] ronchohonchoncho: it is our purpose
[5:44:59] Indervoir: @DARKMAMBA20 ever heard of other religions? ok
[5:45:03] Partybar: Can we play the game before chat tilts you again?
[5:45:03] Ego_Proxy: Being prepared to raise offspring in case of global catastrophe re-population needs > breeding for the sake of breeding
[5:45:10] irspeshal: if you're serving, i'll take a cheeseburger, put an egg on it, and some frieds
[5:45:11] DARKMAMBA20: he asked about nuns
[5:45:12] irspeshal: ...fries
[5:45:14] DARKMAMBA20: not other religions
[5:45:19] DARKMAMBA20: he specifically said nuns
[5:45:28] hamelsky: !following
[5:45:30] DeBruce: and NUNS are not Christians
[5:45:32] globenstine: since when does orthodox religion makes sense anyway. ( never)
[5:45:38] DARKMAMBA20: if its not to serve christ, its to serve Allah, or whatever god you believe in.
[5:45:38] Kirtur: How can you be named Saint and not be serving god bro? Thats false advertising 😂
[5:45:56] Partybar: Wtf nuns are Christians
[5:45:59] DeBruce: Saint is just a term for someone who has done good deeds
[5:46:12] DARKMAMBA20: christians are just catholics but with rule exceptions and changes
[5:46:13] IAmTyson: What the fuck did I tune into lol.
[5:46:19] ronchohonchoncho: like old Saint Nick
[5:46:35] DARKMAMBA20: king Henry couldn't divorce his wife under cathlocism so he created christianity
[5:46:40] DARKMAMBA20: so he could legally divorce his wife
[5:46:43] LiQuiD112: The decision to have or not have children should be based on one’s personal convictions, capabilities, and life situation, rather than societal pressure or expectations. What matters most is that the decision is thoughtful and true to one’s self.
[5:46:45] DeBruce: Nuns in the United States are typically practitioners of the Catholic faith
[5:46:55] ronchohonchoncho: @LiQuiD112 wrong
[5:46:57] hamelsky: !follow
[5:47:09] globenstine: technically a saint is someone that has committed no sin in life. which is next to impossible in practice.
[5:47:10] irspeshal: @LiQuiD112 well worded, steve
[5:47:10] mdiesel394: Henry the 8th didn't create Christianity what are you on about. He created a Protestant branch
[5:47:25] blue_magus: smiteGot @LiQuiD112
[5:47:43] DARKMAMBA20: @LiQuiD112 yes of course, but someone like saint. Well spoken, financially well off, and could provide a good life for children. Only flaw is he will pass down his hairline to his children. Other than that, he could provide a happy and good quality of life for his future blood if he chooses to.
[5:47:45] jaseff693: @LiQuiD112 Love ya steve! long time curse/liquid fan here! you are the goat
[5:47:48] Partybar: Are you dumb? Being a Christian means you believe in christ. Catholicism is a denomination of Christianity
[5:48:01] DARKMAMBA20: just my opinion its a bit selfish to not have kids, if you are emotionally, and financially well off
[5:48:10] DARKMAMBA20: im not against adoption.
[5:48:12] DARKMAMBA20: we could.
[5:48:14] ronchohonchoncho: "Only flaw is he will pass down his hairline" oof
[5:48:15] globenstine: yeah go the brad pit angelina jolie route saint
[5:48:22] DeBruce: @Partybar Catholics came first, not the otherway round
[5:48:24] DARKMAMBA20: but again, I want my kid to look like me
[5:48:29] DARKMAMBA20: and come from my sperm
[5:48:32] globenstine: adopt a bunch of vaguely brown kids.
[5:48:32] DARKMAMBA20: and have my dna
[5:48:33] woopo1: your really not selling parenthood well ngl
[5:48:35] genericnamedan: Dad?
[5:48:35] mdiesel394: isn't that a bit selfish?
[5:48:41] ronchohonchoncho: that's why we call him daddy
[5:48:48] Kirtur: We need a Papa Saint emote lol
[5:48:54] NEZEN27: dude who wants a clone of himself thinks other people are selfish
[5:48:57] Partybar: @debruce it doesn't matter. It's still a denomination of Christianity
[5:48:59] blue_magus: LUL @ronchohonchoncho We need that emote then
[5:49:01] IAmTyson: As a parent this man makes me not want to have another kid lol.
[5:49:08] DeBruce: smiteLaugh  This is PapaSaint
[5:49:14] mdiesel394: you could adopt a kid who has no chance at a good life. So selfish to create one of your own just so they look like you. Using that logic
[5:49:22] DARKMAMBA20: @IAmTyson congrats on parenthood brother
[5:49:26] woopo1: some people have to half kids probably shouldnt be the ones that dont want them lol

[5:50:11] DARKMAMBA20: @mdiesel394 it shouldn't be an expectation. Yes, it would be much more considerable and good for humanity, but at the end of the day its a choice
[5:50:24] DARKMAMBA20: im christian and im pro abortion obviously
[5:50:27] LiQuiD112: masters in league?

[5:51:17] IAmTyson: @liquid112 somebody should get Saint on a LCS team right? Kappa
[5:51:18] hamelsky: You playin palworld ?
[5:51:26] Zedaine112: since smite is porting to unreal5
[5:51:29] woopo1: palworld is the best game rn for sure
[5:51:36] Partybar: Chat is moving so fast no one will read that I have sex with my mother

[5:52:27] Partybar: Real talk Saint. Ass or tits?
[5:52:43] irspeshal: @Partybar its ok to appreciate both
[5:52:44] DARKMAMBA20: @Partybar neither. Its all about their teeth
[5:52:51] Zedaine112: yikes
[5:52:54] DARKMAMBA20: I think teeth is most attractive feature
[5:53:00] IAmTyson: @partybar what about thighs?
[5:53:10] Zedaine112: i mean...as long as they have all of the,=m?
[5:53:12] Zedaine112: them*
[5:53:20] Partybar: I like a woman that can squat some weight
[5:53:26] ronchohonchoncho: @DARKMAMBA20
[5:53:37] ronchohonchoncho: @DARKMAMBA20 ?
[5:53:54] DARKMAMBA20: have you ever seen a hot girl smile, than her teeth ruin it
[5:53:56] DARKMAMBA20: its one of those
[5:54:43] ronchohonchoncho: no
[5:55:12] IAmTyson: Wait but the toothless girl I dated gave the best head.
[5:55:22] Ryance: LOL
[5:55:31] DARKMAMBA20: Tyson are you currently still with your baby momma
[5:55:33] DARKMAMBA20: are you married
[5:55:56] IAmTyson: Marriage is a hard no.
[5:56:01] DARKMAMBA20: ... xDDD
[5:56:44] DARKMAMBA20: children learn and grow better in an married environment, where they can foster good values. that's not an opinion, its a fact. But I would say, its better to not be in a toxic marriage
[5:57:03] IAmTyson: Or just be with the person you love. 15 years and no paper needed
[5:57:10] Rgcommander: @DARKMAMBA20 and what evidence do you have to support that claim?
[5:57:31] misterferrari: chat cursed
[5:57:45] DARKMAMBA20: @IAmTyson doesn't marriage give you tons of tax breaks and benefits
[5:57:50] IAmTyson: No lol
[5:57:50] DARKMAMBA20: its better financially for you to get married
[5:57:54] DARKMAMBA20: you can skip the wedding part
[5:57:56] Rgcommander: alright new topic, what do we think about the LCS this weekend
[5:58:07] irspeshal: @DARKMAMBA20 that's never been proven, it's all anecdotal.  you should just listen to the stremmer and stop talking about this
[5:58:16] IAmTyson: I talked to my accountant. The tax break is negligible.
[5:58:25] woopo1: if your splitting costs it doesnt
[5:58:30] toostii: wat if she ceo of sp500 company BET
[5:58:32] DARKMAMBA20: no we talking about, being with someone for 20+ years and never getting married vs marriage
[5:58:41] Cainage: Bro it's all just incorrect facebook anecdotes
[5:58:41] imperialtft: don't need to be married to split costs
[5:58:46] misterferrari: sex is cool though
[5:58:49] DARKMAMBA20: as a traditional man, I personally want to be the provider
[5:58:51] Kirtur: Having a kid drastically hits you in the finances too lol
[5:58:52] ronchohonchoncho: Saint has daddy money and chat can only relate on the peon level that we are KappaPenis
[5:58:53] DARKMAMBA20: I want to take care of the bills
[5:59:03] NEZEN27: Lol
[5:59:06] IAmTyson: Well you're an idiot then lol
[5:59:08] Hysteriqa: i smell manosphere bs
[5:59:10] ronchohonchoncho: not daddy's money like he the big daddy
[5:59:12] NEZEN27: he wants the bang maid
[5:59:15] irspeshal: @woopo1 split costs or not, you're still creating extra costs, even if it's just like 1 date a week
[5:59:16] Cainage: Cainage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Bedge provider I want a fucking sugar mama
[5:59:20] Indervoir: @NEZEN27  OMEGALUL

[5:59:54] mdiesel394: 100k doesn't get you very far these days
[5:59:55] irspeshal: college student.  aka: has little life experiences and is talking out their ass
[5:59:56] Rgcommander: ok this guy has to be trolling
[5:59:56] misterferrari: i'm an engineer

[6:00:51] Cainage: LOL
[6:00:55] andrewryan1919: 120k in AL...
[6:00:59] irspeshal: for real, though, there are places where 100k is a comfortable enough amount of money
[6:01:03] Cainage: A mansion he says
[6:01:04] woopo1: your gonna get 65k a year if you live in a normal size city
[6:01:05] qyzur: Lol you can't buy shit in a Texas city anymore
[6:01:08] irspeshal: but just barely
[6:01:16] Husklez: buddy i know people who works at swe that makes 70k...   100k+ are like if u are wotking for FAANG
[6:01:20] ronchohonchoncho: I hear the prices are good in Uvalde KappaPenis

[6:01:52] misterferrari: wouldn't lead with that my man
[6:01:53] Ryance: i dont know that many mechanical engineers working remotely lol
[6:01:56] Cainage: Go back to the traditional married couple anecdotes it was more believable
[6:01:57] DARKMAMBA20: there's digital nomads who work in Thailand, Indonesia and other places in asia
[6:01:58] qyzur: Yeah engineers just out of school don't make 100 bro
[6:02:01] NEZEN27: Asking a streamer if he's aware of remote work
[6:02:03] DARKMAMBA20: and their living cost are less than 2k per month
[6:02:18] woopo1: the work online also cut your pay if you live in the middle of nowhere
[6:02:19] misterferrari: you're gonna need relationships if you want that war crime money mechE job
[6:02:27] Reidir: will all the layoffs in tech, this 100k job isnt a sure thing for a student KEKW

[6:04:10] imperialtft: lifestyle creep is real, just wait
[6:04:13] woopo1: its rent and food that cost a lot not a 40$ liquor bottle
[6:04:23] woopo1: youll understand when your off campus meal plan
[6:04:31] lostx403: I'm into high fashion, I buy my clothes from Costco
[6:04:32] johnsmith37: lol
[6:04:32] IAmTyson: @nezen27 I was wondering if I was the only person thinking this.
[6:04:35] DARKMAMBA20: dude im in my fourth year, I pay rent, I cook my own food
[6:04:36] Splyced: run saint run
[6:04:38] DARKMAMBA20: im a full blown adult

[6:05:00] Falconeyi: bro you dont have an income
[6:05:02] NEZEN27: @IAmTyson its a very specific type of weird chatter lol
[6:05:06] qyzur: Bro you just said you don't have an income
[6:05:06] Indervoir: OMEGALUL
[6:05:15] mdiesel394: wives and kids are certainly expensive
[6:05:17] qyzur: Living off loans and parents money lol
[6:05:18] Vynair: mr strimmer if i wanted to be a degen solo bolo who just plays games how much money i gotta scrape together each year
[6:05:20] forsake23: KEKW
[6:05:20] Definitely_notkappa: kirkland is POGCHAMPION
[6:05:24] Indervoir: this guy is crazyyyy
[6:05:29] blue_magus: LUL @qyzur
[6:05:40] DARKMAMBA20: ok what about owning farm land? or hunting, or growing your own food and veggies. That is much healthier and cost efficient. Having chickens, eggs everyday etc
[6:05:44] DARKMAMBA20: the farming life
[6:05:46] Falconeyi: hes not crazy, hes just naive college student lol
[6:05:47] Indervoir: no worry man, you will change your mind once you're there ok
[6:05:48] ElvisSmite: ElvisSmite subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Another week of ramen down the drain
[6:05:49] irspeshal: @DARKMAMBA20 seriously.  just stop before the hole you're digging gets deeper
[6:05:55] Cainage: LOL
[6:06:06] mdiesel394: you do realize the farming life is a ton of work
[6:06:08] woopo1: having your own chickens is a negative return
[6:06:11] mdiesel394: your
[6:06:12] woopo1: i did the math
[6:06:14] DARKMAMBA20: yes, but its therapeutic
[6:06:18] NEZEN27: dude listening to the podcasts that act like farming is just picking apples and picking up eggs
[6:06:18] Reidir: you know that farming takes a lot of time before it gives any crops?
[6:06:22] DARKMAMBA20: the simple life is always better than the high life
[6:06:24] DARKMAMBA20: and that's a fact
[6:06:31] irspeshal: that's an opinion
[6:06:34] ElvisSmite: Also you couldn't grow all the crops you would need to survive
[6:06:36] misterferrari: farming is easy guys
[6:06:42] IAmTyson: Man's gonna be a mechanical engineer and farmer in his free time... and a wife and kid(s)... this man has a clone who's gonna split his work load.
[6:06:50] misterferrari: saint has 27 farm, farming is easy
[6:06:52] mdiesel394: you better have a lot of kids for free farm labor
[6:06:55] lostx403: We need some stardew valley experts to weigh in on farming
[6:06:55] DARKMAMBA20: imagine going home to your beautiful wife and kids, and look out the window and see your beautiful farm land and the work you put into it
[6:07:05] mdiesel394: but you're not going home you work from home life?
[6:07:10] Wiznatts: imagine doing that and then dying at 35 of dysentery
[6:07:11] Splyced: Ill have whatever he is on

[6:07:19] Rgcommander: COPIUM
[6:07:20] DARKMAMBA20: the work is the work you put in your farm
[6:07:20] Indervoir: someone saves me
[6:07:22] ronchohonchoncho: I like farming
[6:07:23] Cainage: Let me take time off from my full time engineering gig to make 100k a year to farm chickens and food for my family KEKW
[6:07:28] DARKMAMBA20: driving your machines, doing farm work
[6:07:30] IAmTyson: Somebody get me this man's drug dealer. I need this good shit.
[6:07:33] mdiesel394: but you're the sole breadwinner you need to work your day job and do the farming
[6:07:34] Ryance: somebody has been watching too much tiktok
[6:07:38] DARKMAMBA20: I've been sober 3 years
[6:07:39] Wiznatts: "i like farming" guy who's never been within 500 miles of a farm
[6:07:39] Wiznatts: xD
[6:07:41] qyzur: To sum it up he's going to be a digital nomad engineer, married with kids, making over 100k a year, while farming multiple acres of crops to feed this family.

[6:07:52] NEZEN27: farmers only
[6:07:52] DARKMAMBA20: farming life is after retired life
[6:07:59] Splyced: @qyzur EZ
[6:07:59] DARKMAMBA20: you have to be financially stable
[6:08:00] blue_magus: Lol
[6:08:02] m0k3tAl1ty: i spend all week driving a semi-truck, i dont have energy to do shit
[6:08:02] lostx403: Huh
[6:08:02] DARKMAMBA20: to do it
[6:08:11] mdiesel394: but if you're retired your kids are grown
[6:08:12] Reidir: have you seen all the news about farmers protesting? farming isnt easy when they want to make it even harder by limiting the fertilizer
[6:08:16] ElvisSmite: Hey chat I'm starting a farming commune if anyone wants to join up just sign up on this Google survey judging interest right now
[6:08:18] mdiesel394: so you can't raise your kids on the farm
[6:08:32] DARKMAMBA20: your giving your kids REAL EXPERIENCE
[6:08:34] DARKMAMBA20: not fuckin ipads
[6:08:37] DARKMAMBA20: and computers
[6:08:38] DARKMAMBA20: and youtube
[6:08:43] baku125: someone get this guy out of here jfc

[6:08:59] Indervoir: @DARKMAMBA20 hey can I add you somewhere? I want to see an update of your life in the next 10 years
[6:09:05] Indervoir: you really made me curious
[6:09:08] NEZEN27: those poor kids going in the bunker next time a blog mentions end days
[6:09:10] ElvisSmite: Financially stable starting a farm with no knowledge or experience sounds stable at
[6:09:11] Rgcommander: @DARKMAMBA20 bro dont you have another top Olaf guide to write or something? why are you here?
[6:09:15] Splyced: Yo if life is as easy as he is putting it... wtf am I doing wrong? Sadge
[6:09:25] DARKMAMBA20: @Indervoir sure whisper me in twitch
[6:09:31] Zedaine112: @DARKMAMBA20 i know a couple about 30 that own an automated dairy farm in wisconsin, and another couple in their 40's-50's that own a traditional dairy farm in MI. its not early life nor retired life.
[6:09:31] lostx403: Just don't be poor
[6:09:36] lostx403: Win at life
[6:09:41] misterferrari: no computers/tablets for the kids. add it to the lore
[6:10:00] woopo1: do they get gameboys like we did
[6:10:07] DARKMAMBA20: im just saying what is ideal, but all of this is theoretical
[6:10:08] DARKMAMBA20: I have not yet
[6:10:11] DARKMAMBA20: put in plans of actions
[6:10:16] ElvisSmite: Not paying attention to the game? Too busy planning out the farm @saintvicious
[6:10:17] DARKMAMBA20: to achieve any of this yet
[6:10:19] DARKMAMBA20: I dont even have a gf
[6:10:20] DARKMAMBA20: xD
[6:10:36] mdiesel394: it's easy to talk shit about computers and tablets but you want to keep your kids entertained 100% of the time when you're exhausted from working your job and doing all the farm work?
[6:10:49] Cainage: Or a fully developed frontal lobe.
[6:10:55] DARKMAMBA20: @mdiesel394 yes cause when I have kids, I will put their lives over mine
[6:11:00] DARKMAMBA20: that's parenthood
[6:11:01] Falconeyi: I wonder how much you'll change in a year after you finish college lmao
[6:11:12] blue_magus: smiteGood
[6:11:26] mdiesel394: that's a noble thought but it's harder to that 100% of the time than you think
[6:11:30] DARKMAMBA20: its the same feeling when you force yourself to go to gym when you dont want to, but this time its your kids
[6:11:32] ElvisSmite: Pulling it off? I wish I had a nice farm wife to go home to and get it pulled off
[6:11:33] NEZEN27: homey living the rom com dream, wants to have it all
[6:11:37] bRAINdif: @DARKMAMBA20 ur plans are not realistic man, make ur plan realistic and ull get there
[6:11:47] Zedaine112: @DARKMAMBA20 he is putting their life over his..by providing for them by working on the farm...wut
[6:11:54] ronchohonchoncho: Farming Kreygasm
[6:12:09] DARKMAMBA20: by working on the farm, teaching them discipline. Feeding the chickens, taking the cows out, its not a chore
[6:12:10] DARKMAMBA20: its fun
[6:12:11] woopo1: your either gonna make 100k in a tech hub and be poor or make 65k in a mid city after sending in 1k applications
[6:12:13] DARKMAMBA20: it gives them purpose
[6:12:21] DARKMAMBA20: im not using them as slaves
[6:12:38] ElvisSmite: Taking the cows out is the best thing I've read today
[6:12:41] misterferrari: @woopo1 this sounds like my experience as well
[6:12:43] mdiesel394: farming work is dangerous you need to be careful how much work you give to children
[6:12:48] LowlyNoon: I'm not using them as slaves, they just have to earn their keep on DarkMamba20's farm
[6:13:00] Shimoroku: just take the cows out for a walk around the block
[6:13:00] Cainage: Child labor KEKW
[6:13:06] Wiznatts: yeah make your kids do manual labor they're gonna love and totally talk to you when they move out
[6:13:10] DARKMAMBA20: y'all acting like picking the eggs from the chicken coop is children labour the same they use in china and bengledesh
[6:13:15] DARKMAMBA20: come on twitch chat
[6:13:20] ronchohonchoncho: SwiftRage Feudalism
[6:13:27] ElvisSmite: Who's gonna carry the boats..who's gonna take the cows out
[6:13:30] woopo1: i encourage you to do the math on chicken coops. its not worth your time
[6:13:35] mdiesel394: running a farm is a lot more than picking eggs out of a chicken coup. You're delusional
[6:13:37] Rgcommander: @Wiznatts Queue up that song: "And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man in the moon..."
[6:13:38] Kirtur: My man, I grew up on a large dairy farm in MN. That shit aint easy at all and the work NEVER ends... Its not some dream life lol
[6:13:41] misterferrari: bro if you think you're going to get a job straight out of school and have much money at all you're clueless
[6:13:53] Cainage: It's called living on twitch chat on your parents dime
[6:13:55] Falconeyi: hes completely clueless LOL
[6:13:56] misterferrari: unless you have a PhD but that has it's own challenges
[6:14:11] ElvisSmite: Forget the chicken coop costs. Do the math on raising those farm labor kids.
[6:14:12] DARKMAMBA20: @Cainage brother, I rent my own apartment, I have student loans
[6:14:13] DARKMAMBA20: lol
[6:14:21] Cainage: You said you don't have income
[6:14:23] Cainage: Which is it
[6:14:24] DARKMAMBA20: I pay my own groceries and food
[6:14:29] Falconeyi: dont forget you dont have income either
[6:14:32] Zedaine112: on what income?
[6:14:36] misterferrari: not the loans.... oh no
[6:14:36] DARKMAMBA20: student loans
[6:14:36] Indervoir: oh no no no

[6:14:47] DARKMAMBA20: I dont live in the us
[6:14:47] misterferrari: maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan i'm sorry
[6:14:56] LowlyNoon: They don't provide that much and also it still has interest

[6:15:13] Falconeyi: KEKW
[6:15:22] lostx403: Time to live the homeless shelter life
[6:15:25] ElvisSmite: @lostx403 must be French Canada
[6:15:27] Cainage: @lostx403 In his fantasy version of Canada, not the real one
[6:15:28] mdiesel394: your'e gonna buy a farm in canada? KEKW
[6:15:30] Rgcommander: i literally have a friend in canada who works for Indeed. This man is sorting about a kilo of COPIUM an hour right now
[6:15:32] NEZEN27: man was gonna work a dairy farm in texas remote from canada
[6:15:32] DARKMAMBA20: LOL well I use my osap loans to pay my rent and food
[6:15:34] Cainage: In the real one we get free healthcare and that's it LOL
[6:15:35] mdiesel394: is this after you pay off your student loans?
[6:15:36] Zetonegi: @lostx403 at his place
[6:15:40] Spiker222: wait what fuckin part of Canada are your bills only 2k a month you live in new found land or some shit I’m Canadian now I know you’re capping
[6:15:44] qyzur: Someone tell him about the Canadian dollar please
[6:15:53] DARKMAMBA20: London Ontario is pretty fuckin cheap bro
[6:15:53] misterferrari: if you're scraping 20-30k after rent/food straight out of school you are a much better engineer than most
[6:15:55] ronchohonchoncho: @saintvicious do you have a favourite twitch chatter or do you love us all equally?
[6:15:56] DARKMAMBA20: my rent is only 800 a month
