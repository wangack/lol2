[2:31:43] hogleey: @Nightbot Gasp she hates her son
[2:31:47] Hyst28: @MadTT_ the simple explanation is that since twitch embedded the ads inside of the player now, the main way to block them has become to split the feed, so that you run the ads simultaneously, technically still watching them, but it means that the stream stutters and runs at lower quality in the player since it is effectively split in two, it would be akin to having your brain split in half and trying to do math

[3:07:16] saad2aj: do u ski?
[3:07:17] Hyst28: @allaure damn thats a bit surprising, normally I find that true crime is even more overly dramatic that a medical soap like House tended to be
