[3:40:23] mike_____99: vayne it depends, if shes bad and "doesnt have hands" yea its possible to win but with hands absolutely unplayable
[3:40:39] masoku322: understood
[3:40:41] mike_____99: just like riven with hands is absolutely unplayable almost and aatrox and fiora and all that
[3:40:46] kalehond_euw: Sunder d sky with 5 stacks will hit pretty hard

[3:48:59] soryegeton21: @imdariusmain im masters as well i fail to see your point? every champ has mus that are hard but that doesn't equal unplayable rivens that are beating you are getting stomped by better darius players is all im saying
