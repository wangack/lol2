[4:10:49] real_true_jesus: if you constantly win your lane does the game pair you with mates that consisitently lose their lanes?
[4:11:33] real_true_jesus: there are achievements tho
[4:11:33] Galkaria: predictive patterns? maybe
[4:11:37] real_true_jesus: indicating you owned your lane
[4:11:40] real_true_jesus: doesnt it
[4:11:53] Hooded_Stranger_: They do have a badge that says you "Win lane" by ending at like 10 mins with a certain amount of gold above your lane conterpart
[4:12:02] Hooded_Stranger_: So they might have some dogshit metrics
[4:12:21] jojayjoo: sej won the lane for trundle
[4:12:23] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[4:12:42] afghanpete: no biased towards you but yes u would have won that lane ez if that sej did not camp
[4:12:58] Galkaria: If riot is only looking at gold and assists, I think it'd be fair to say that yes, he did win. the nuance of what -really- happens is always lost when you look at data points as a whole
[4:13:40] Galkaria: if X player has Y more gold than Z player, player X confirmed winner, throw them into winner queue
[4:14:11] Hooded_Stranger_: I agree tha gold above another person doesn't mean you won lane, was just saying that Riot might be dumb enough to beleive that their shitty metrics are enough for anything
[4:14:25] Hooded_Stranger_: but I also don't beleive they would allocate the resources to micromanage their game either
[4:14:27] MadSpectre47: Riven?

[4:19:20] real_true_jesus: all these effoorts of riot making trying to ban or mute the "toxic" players are just bandaids to a problem caused by soloq,  the game in nature is really toxic, i ve met nice ppl that melt down because of this shit queing system

[4:23:54] PlaginDL: by reports, statistics about your active accounts on that PC etc
[4:24:09] rawrqq: @RaggaXBomb not true they only ban accounts that are suspected as bought/shared

[4:25:15] Euravel: holy fuck this dogshit game has negative matchmaking balnce
[4:25:21] PlaginDL: VAC does look at your PC specs/serial numbers for a long time already
[4:25:56] RaggaXBomb: can it go by ip? like 1 account per ip?
[4:26:09] sartrik: it's not root, no
[4:26:27] wizizman: client token is enough tho
[4:26:33] 6x5x1x18: Yes i can
[4:26:38] RaggaXBomb: oh yea people do live together
[4:26:45] cptsunnyday: @Wingsofdeath They read steam, who register all ur actual MACs coz they obw know ur hardware, like ur GPU, CPU etc
[4:26:49] sartrik: if you have multiple steam accounts, your steam folder / appdata folder will have this information. and steam can access this information. etc.
[4:27:15] real_true_jesus: i dont think there is 1 rule,  but rather a set of metrics to determine if you are a smurf,   maybe even machine learning at this point, one woudl imagine
