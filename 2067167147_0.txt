[2:32:42] SokiEuW: A-Z can pick any champ from A - until all A has a win - then move to B etc. if only x left in pool and x is picked/banned, chat votes on champ from next pool for you to play. If someone donates 10 subs they can bail you out and add any champ (that doesn't have a win yet to your pool). if someone donates 10 subs during your current game, you have to build whatever item they say next lourBusiness

[3:00:49] dystroyka: people Looking at Lourlo's match history
[3:00:51] yodaupyours: yone top
[3:01:02] lollers22: When playing Caitlyn top against a Smoulder top in League of Legends, you should focus on a build that maximizes your range advantage, poke potential, and survivability due to Smoulder's ability to close gaps and deal significant damage up close. Since Smoulder isn't a traditional champion and might refer to a particular playstyle or a misunderstanding, I'll give you general advice for a ranged top laner against a melee bruiser or tank, focusing on kiting, sustain, and damage.
[3:01:06] KashMoneyKale: @granolasoul did you specifically suppress notifs for everyone and here
[3:01:08] Bear_IRL: lourBedge
