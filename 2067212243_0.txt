[3:57:29] bigmikey47: @buffer_overflow_ isn‚Äôt that place fucking scary. correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but never been to America
[3:58:02] TwitchTime89: @buffer_overflow_ i bet it's expensive for a place to live in SF.
[3:58:19] TwitchTime89: Vibe
[3:58:41] buffer_overflow_: hahahahaha @bigmikey47 yeah... I mean... there are scary parts.. like in many places... but you know... theres always nice(er) parts haha
[3:58:45] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[3:59:27] buffer_overflow_: oh yeah @TwitchTime89 , expensive for sure... but I am in LA right now... so tbh probably as expensive :D
[3:59:44] bigmikey47: @buffer_overflow_ oh sweet lol cause I‚Äôve heard multiple people say some of the baddest mf‚Äôers are from sf and I was worried for you üòÇ but I‚Äôm just an ignorant New Zealander
[3:59:49] icehat_702: she walks forward 3 extra times
[4:00:09] omnitrix925: does she thinks shes gonna kill thresh
[4:01:01] TwitchTime89: @buffer_overflow_ ohhh. it'll be a lot cooler there. i've been to both....LA and SF, and i couldn't believe the difference in temperature between the two. I drove from LA to SF, so it was at the same time. It was so cold in SF. It's beautiful there though. Such a unique city
[4:01:09] buffer_overflow_: no no, not ignorant at all @bigmikey47 , I've also been hearing SF has been going downhill and in the media its always horrible things... but I have some friends in SF and they seem happy and having fun, so you know... haha
[4:01:29] wilfrLd: This is what you get for ditching Janna Kappa
[4:01:55] apenotorious: Bay Area bb
[4:01:56] buffer_overflow_: @stunt I'm so sad of leaving Santa Monica :( ... but you know.... it's a good opportunity
[4:02:16] BaneBladeV: I hope it's median not average
[4:02:27] apenotorious: LA is so sprawling too. Much prefer the Bay myself
[4:02:30] buffer_overflow_: @TwitchTime89 yes!! So windy as well :(
[4:02:44] Sanecore: 100k is considered poverty level here in SF
[4:02:45] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 yesss!! it was!!
[4:02:48] Sanecore: or just above it
[4:02:51] ThomasTheTwink: Taric

[4:03:06] buffer_overflow_: @apenotorious oh nice! good to hear that
[4:03:06] m228828: Hwei anyhow

[4:03:39] buffer_overflow_: @Sanecore yeah for sure.... particularly  if its for a family
[4:04:04] buffer_overflow_: @TwitchTime89 yes, I'm excited to explore nor cal
[4:04:13] apenotorious: SF is totally fine. I prefer the chiller vibes in the East Bay (Oakland/Berkeley) but SF is nice too
[4:04:29] Lazynameross: her letters are stronger/faster im sure
[4:04:49] Lazynameross: BASED urgot ign
[4:04:55] buffer_overflow_: @apenotorious My new job required 2/3 times a week to be in office -.-  and its SF... so probably will prefer to live in SF :D
[4:04:55] Jakmo: played against a Camille supp and my team was shocked she's a popular supp. Stunt's influence hasn't gotten that far yet

[4:05:58] bigmikey47: I lowkey reckon the only reason I haven‚Äôt visited the states yet is how afraid I am of people having guns üòÇ I‚Äôve travelled nearly all of Europe and parts of Asia
[4:06:04] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 yeah. that'll be cool
[4:06:17] apenotorious: I think people who talk shit about SF just can‚Äôt handle being around poverty which is the real struggle in SF. Tech has displaced so many people who used to live in SF
[4:06:21] Lazynameross: stackies
[4:06:35] StrangeMink: 3 MIN AD
[4:06:41] StrangeMink: chat did they win the fight

[4:08:19] bigmikey47: @desuladesu I‚Äôve defended myself and friends and partners with my fists countless times and had knives pulled on me but fuck idk what I‚Äôd do if I saw a gun üòÇ
[4:08:23] buffer_overflow_: @apenotorious yeah its pretty sad...  I mean tbf it can be very shocking seeing the disparity and people just dieying in the streets
[4:08:33] confusedpanda7: when can you pick taric ? I feel like you can get punish hard in lane when picking into enchanters? do you agree?
[4:09:00] TwitchTime89: i live in Canada. I visited California years ago, and i was with family from Oakland, so it was ok. @bigmikey47
[4:09:18] jeriart: oh wtf
[4:09:21] jeriart: taric game
[4:09:37] buffer_overflow_: But I agree, if I wasn't in tech, it would be impossible to live anywhere in California.
[4:09:50] dissolusioned: taric goes fimbulwinter right?

[4:12:50] Atanaxe: ah didnt know dorans ring changed my b
[4:13:06] Synastar: skipping tear? tear no good?
[4:13:08] bladetrinity16: deals bonus damage to minions + has passive mana regen
[4:13:08] bigmikey47: @buffer_overflow_ I‚Äôve skied France, Switzerland and Italy. Japan or Canada are next after my babies born and they get a little older. desperate to visit Canada tho!
[4:13:39] juryoku_: mana on minion kill hasnt been a thing since s11

[4:44:24] Cariyla: Wait what? stunt playing Ez supp? But this guy never stop innovating with so many cool picks? This is why stunt is the best support in the world
[4:44:24] jamessaysdance: why don't my teammates praise me when I play ez support hmm
[4:44:26] Cariyla: :3
[4:44:34] vegandiamond: ICANT
[4:44:38] bladetrinity16: he said in the interview afterwards that he zoned out in champ select and heard ezreal so locked it, but his coaches and team backed him playing it
[4:44:39] bladetrinity16: so he did
[4:44:44] vegandiamond: statistics stanley
[4:44:53] tiagosoares230904: @stunt I really like Keira because he is always innovating with crazy picks, and he does it really well.

[4:45:37] ihaveplants: This one's for you! - in Seraphine voice
[4:45:40] denunciator: it's hard for me to win when the games not up to me Aware
[4:45:40] peachgummirings: wasn‚Äôt there a game where he was having a bit too much fun and lost?
[4:45:41] tiagosoares230904: I like to play Seraphine support or pyke
[4:45:44] bladetrinity16: @denunciator to be fair, high elo kr soloq is just a lot of 15 min games
[4:45:45] Lazynameross: ive only played him in aram and its free af OMEGALUL
[4:45:46] icehat_702: i LOVE milio! but just for the night at the roxbury reference
[4:45:53] Thommenius: Would Braum be a good pick in this game
[4:45:54] ems__c: no milio is fun u sit 1 screen away and press button
[4:46:26] ihaveplants: KEKW
[4:46:27] Thommenius: u traded pick order with twitch
[4:46:36] vegandiamond: scaling feels like such a scam
[4:46:50] juryoku_: wheres your dorans ring Madge
[4:46:54] bladetrinity16: scaling is good and well, but you have to be able to get to the scaled point
[4:47:23] vegandiamond: ohh LULW
[4:47:29] ThomasTheTwink: iron is fake Tier too!
[4:47:31] bladetrinity16: ill never see the fabricated tiers down here in bronze
[4:47:35] Thommenius: Only good "new" tier was Iron
[4:47:39] LondonnIsRed: Im emerald :(
[4:47:43] ihaveplants: What is Emerald and GM then? hmmm
[4:47:49] yamyam_x: iron is not real
[4:47:52] SantaLive: Stunt what is your opinion bout senna utility/tank
[4:47:59] ihaveplants: Sadge
[4:48:05] Lazynameross: iron is real, its just abused
[4:48:44] juryoku_: its funny riot added emerald so everyone can go up a tier, so silver players now think they are "gold" KEKW
[4:49:03] ThomasTheTwink: I hate twitch
[4:49:28] Lazynameross: he did fine
[4:49:32] Lazynameross: just out of range
[4:49:57] Cariyla: @juryoku_ It's so funny when people are like "after being hard stuck silver for 8 years I finally managed to hit gold this year"
[4:50:00] Cariyla: They are unaware
[4:50:04] Lazynameross: lb nyoo
[4:50:05] Thommenius: @juryoku_ Did it not pretty much just divide top plat and low diamond  into a new tier, kinda like plat but with shittier macro compared to now dia
[4:50:14] ThomasTheTwink: nyoo
[4:50:42] yonays: nyoo
[4:50:52] juryoku_: @Thommenius no, it boosted everyone up a rank, so old gold is now plat, old plat now emerald
[4:51:13] Cariyla: Truege
[4:51:22] ThomasTheTwink: neeko complaining about cheese lmao
[4:51:22] Cariyla: It pretty much shifted the median rank up a tier
[4:51:30] Thommenius: @juryoku_ so by that logic did Iron derank everyone by one?
[4:52:52] jmangs34: i love milio OuO
[4:52:56] ThomasTheTwink: stuntVibe stuntCampfire2
[4:53:00] cloudydaisies: stuntVibe
[4:53:00] DemyxTheNobody: yes he is fun
[4:53:21] Kazazel: Iron is a different case to the other ranks, Bronze used to be full of Bronze V 0LP players, Iron just made a division for those people
[4:53:26] LondonnIsRed: why no sweeper here?
[4:53:29] Lazynameross: you exist to ruin important enemy cc :3
[4:54:58] vanliketheshoes: waow

[4:55:39] AkshanSama: spear of shojin would go HARD
[4:55:40] ThomasTheTwink: rush sundered sky
[4:55:52] juryoku_: it use to be 5.6, 24, 29, 24, 12 percentange for iron-plat, not its iron 7, bronze-plat 20 each, 12 emerald, so everyone got moved up and iron got bigger
[4:56:02] TwitchTime89: go stunt peepoCheer
[4:56:21] Cariyla: eavCheer quantCheer
[4:56:24] AkshanSama: apparently its slightly bugged on ranged champs, dk what the bug is tho
[4:56:29] Lazynameross: shojin zyra? pausecham
[4:56:37] TwitchTime89: owoCheer
[4:57:07] SantaLive: I'm doing redemption on enchanter supps 1st item cause status and is broken early lvl's cause 300hp is better when u have 1k instead of 3k for example and I have more map presence. Am I wrong for doing that ?
[4:57:14] icehat_702: renata?
[4:57:22] ThomasTheTwink: it increases spell damage?
[4:57:29] GlacialEmbrace: spammy ones like Cassiopeia?
[4:57:33] ThomasTheTwink: I thought it was just cdr lol
[4:57:50] TwitchTime89: stitchGuitar
[4:57:51] juryoku_: it would have to be an AP champ with AD ratios, so kayle, akali, ezreal
[4:57:54] DemyxTheNobody: ya new shojin gives dmg
[4:58:15] ThomasTheTwink: shojin Elise stuntWooHoo

[5:05:53] ems__c: @Cariyla got himworking in league shein oop
[5:05:59] shinyclodsire: @GlacialEmbrace his passive burn is more beneficial. and you really only use q for the knockback and levelling it doesnt do a lot for that
[5:06:01] Cariyla: @GlacialEmbrace the cooldown doesn't scale with level and most of the value is in the knock back instead of the damage eeeh
[5:06:13] LondonnIsRed: one more game! i just joined

[5:09:14] SantaLive: @stunt redemption is not a good 1st item on enchanter? I never see no one rushing but in my opinion 300hp heal is better on early levels also you can use it on a drake fight for example. And redempt status are broken. 15% heal/shield. Is that item garbage, am I wrong for building it ? Genuine question

[8:44:37] redtauro: @DudeBroMaximus I think so, I also feel like I have always W available as well
[8:44:38] Lazynameross: twitch worth levelling over panth etc?

[8:52:23] Lazynameross: no idea
[8:52:35] Femuline: end on master hehe
[8:52:42] DionV98: E max build Zilean isn't recommended. I would suggest you try 3 points E, then max W. By far better and stronger. Warmogs not recommended @stunt
[8:52:54] 420paul69: xayah supp might hit
[8:53:05] Lazynameross: where is this build coming from
[8:53:17] Lazynameross: there wasnt another item suggested before the warmogs??

[9:38:03] Sekhmet130: what a fiesta rofl
[9:38:29] PRPL_BLITZ: @Lazynameross yeah its tough, id love to see a website like that
[9:38:32] CameraOnLocked: a lot of sites tellWR% with bot duos, but nothing much more than tht

[9:39:28] PRPL_BLITZ: I just understand basics but I dont always know what I should pick as the adc. Some things are obvious like knockup w/ sam or something but Im trying to find a website that talks about synergy and what supports/adc's work well together
[9:41:03] CameraOnLocked: niceee
[9:41:42] xMnemotic: @PRPL_BLITZ You should focus on having a roster of 3-4 champs that are good in most lineups and be REALLY good on those. That'll get you further than trying to match what your support picks.
[9:41:42] Lazynameross: rip jinx
[9:41:58] Lazynameross: why zed crying lol
