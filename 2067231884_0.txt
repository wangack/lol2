If you're Diamond or higher though, you've sufficiently shown you're "good". Even leaving Gold puts you well above average.

[4:04:37] ddawggg: Chris and trick are the best nasus players in my eyes. I dont care about other player being higher ranked
[4:04:43] nonvmer: @stacksaddiction why are you even asking this? Games are for fun. He finds it funny to play this way.
[4:05:02] saw141: He likes AP Nasus because it lets him farm more and teamfight more. There are a lot of comps where AD/Tank Nasus just gets kited and if you can't Q, you're almost completely useless.
[4:05:14] leafzel: lets go!
[4:05:14] mo0se19: D caneee
[4:05:36] pidde99: whats the best site to check league rankings and stuff
[4:05:36] stacksaddiction: @saw141 but u cant carry and be the main character on ap nasus
[4:05:42] ddawggg: The thing is people are more obsessed with ranks then having fun
[4:05:51] ddawggg: League rank aint getting you anywhere in life
[4:05:53] ddawggg: FYI :)
[4:05:54] saw141: @stacksaddiction Can't on AD either if you get kited/ccd too much.
[4:05:57] minniethesooh: i mean, being completely honest and realistic, if he can't see the pros/cons of each build, he's probably hard stuck silver
[4:06:09] minniethesooh: so why bother even justifying
[4:06:11] leafzel: the higher the rank the more harder it is for champions like nasus or garen to play
[4:06:11] stacksaddiction: @saw141 yes IF but on ap u never will
[4:06:15] Chiyuhatsu: FeelsBadMan Silver still higher rank than me.

I also just think it's completely unnecessary. How many cheaters are really on League? I've played for like 13 years and have never once for sure seen one.

[5:00:32] Chiyuhatsu: @Unifrutti I mean, it's turnbased. And they did it before in the previous game.
[5:00:45] saw141: I wish you'd play COD on stream like you used to Sadge you were the best quickscoper.
[5:00:45] Unifrutti: Are the circles just their move range but certain abilities can reach beyond that?
[5:00:46] Chiyuhatsu: It does look jarring though coming from a Beat em' up brawler to a Turnbased admittedly.
[5:01:03] Unifrutti: I've never played any of the Yakuza games so I wouldn't know about the last one. Lol
[5:01:17] Chiyuhatsu: It's probably something similar to Neptunia. The circle is how far they can move, abilities can 'extend' that range.

[6:30:40] LoLGammelsmurf: Hi guys! I'm in need of some advice... I've noticed that I start to tilt real quick when something goes wrong in-game but I don't know how not to tilt in league xD
[6:31:33] FuwafuwaYui: play to improve, not to win Okayge
[6:31:42] marccalloway: Brk nasus is the real deal

[6:32:02] MidnightSilverr: that healing
[6:32:12] hamzajamal25: juh
[6:32:16] saw141: @LoLGammelsmurf It becomes easier to not tilt when you understand more about everything that's going wrong. Not trying to say you don't. But once you can realistically identify your own problems vs your teams, it's a bit less frustrating. Also it helps a lot if you aren't super pressed for time. Losing feels a lot worse if you can only play a couple games a day.
[6:32:19] pitbullnamed_flower: @LoLGammelsmurf i see i was like that too when i first started just play for fun and always blame urself not your team
[6:32:31] pitbullnamed_flower: i was once hard stuck in gold now im diamond 2

[6:36:46] PhilosoPhiddle: @LoLGammelsmurf I also think it helps to understand not every game is winnable. My goal is to always feel like I played my personal best for the champ I ended up getting. If I do that I am happy. If not I know I need to improve. Others will feed. Others will rage. You can only control yourself.
