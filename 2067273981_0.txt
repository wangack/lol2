[1:59:32] marvinhozi: This library is not built very effectively and the built-in rate limiting of the library you are using is not very strict. It's not pulling the chat based on IP so you could create like 3 tik tok accounts and cycle between them to connect to chat. Basically tik tok is invalidating your cookies because their bot systems are marking you as suspicious.

[2:00:32] nisoteric34: @Qwelfalia same NotCrying
[2:00:47] marvinhozi: It is hard to 100% narrow it down without any logs on the server's end. Do you have any logs?
[2:00:48] the_acidrain: just look at htop
[2:00:48] funkyweb: Subs arr free or wt

[2:02:00] the_acidrain: use htop, find the process using cpu, then do an strace on it
[2:02:17] chilloriwill: As I said, need to refresh cache
[2:02:17] Nevrot1k: @Cowsep have you killed panda boss in magicraft btw?
[2:02:18] chilloriwill: LETS G
[2:02:29] marvinhozi: Server should still have logs even if it crashed
[2:02:34] nisoteric34: theres a panda boss POGGERS
[2:02:41] matydark99: Cowsep do you have a SETUP Video?
[2:02:53] marvinhozi: What server are you running, more specifically, what is the library running on?
[2:02:53] StreamElements: server Cowsep is playing on Korea server.

[2:11:17] Skaglicker: OOM can be cured with swapping to disk, that again would use CPU
[2:11:33] marvinhozi: paste bin
[2:11:53] dazzyflik: @Doomdmd thanks for the gift cowH
[2:12:01] the_acidrain: you can instead get the user running the process and do journalctl -u username
[2:12:11] marvinhozi: I do not but i am going to spin up Discord
[2:12:43] the_acidrain: because if you cat everything in syslog youre going to get everything related to the entire system. you probably want to narrow it down to the service account first
[2:12:56] marvinhozi: never post on chat. sensitive info

[2:24:27] Boksa2: cowO
[2:24:29] marvinhozi: Here is what happened: You ran out of memory so the server started some recovery processes and the CPU was overwhelmed with trying to deal with those recovery processes.

[2:31:02] Stormix_dev: I'd be careful with puppeteer if you ever user it (make sure to clean up pages and close browser after calls)
[2:31:03] diramude: hes just really racist

[2:32:13] nisoteric34: Tomfoolery
[2:32:26] marvinhozi: also puppeteer is a massive problem if you don't know how to resource-manage it. You have to clean up the browser after you open pages.
[2:32:32] bagheeeraa: nice flash

[2:33:20] nisoteric34: ADS
[2:33:25] nisoteric34: Tomfoolery
[2:34:27] marvinhozi: I am pretty sure it's puppeteer. Memory crashes can be more dangerous than CPU. The cpu takes information from memory to process and when there is a mem crash, the cpu is locked.
[2:34:32] AllAroundTV1: REAL ANNIE BOT Pog
[2:35:09] caciuslove: walked in 2 pinks but w/e LUL

[3:09:19] olayni12: cowsep , if u ever had the choice to travel 5 years into the future or  5 years into the past , what would you choose ?
[3:09:52] lasagna_thief_69: 5 years but retain your knowledge. Hell yeah
[3:10:10] PhilXaphas: 5 years in the future is nice if you need to get through something  5 years in the past is nice if you regret or think you can improve
[3:10:15] olayni12: i travel into the past and fuck up every teacher made fun of me xD
[3:10:17] BASS186: 5 years in the past and bet all in sports lol
[3:10:18] CantyBloke: did you have back pain 5 years ago?

[3:12:53] olayni12: which year do you want to go back to and why ?
[3:12:56] CantyBloke: try marijuana :)
[3:13:02] PhilXaphas: I've got general anxiety and covid was really good in that regard for me
[3:13:09] SovietWrestler: @Cowsep Protein shakes and liquid food.
[3:13:11] lasagna_thief_69: Gotta get them Calcium gains
[3:13:22] Danqwerty11: 4Head
[3:13:38] chilloriwill: that is why I eat whole raw eggs lasagna
[3:13:39] PhilXaphas: everybody wants to get over anxiety - it's a problem because we can't
[3:13:41] z3r0m1n4: r u playing on ph server?
[3:13:54] blackula84: If you are changing your diet expect changes in bowels and don't freak out. Eat things like oatmeal for breakfast plenty of fiber and nutrients
[3:14:03] blackula84: Beans as well
[3:14:10] teemoshroomsrdumb: Gotta cut out carbs and bread and you'll be able to eat more calories
[3:14:11] BASS186: BERSERK Boner boobaPls
[3:14:43] Skrillexx21: Ltes go cowsep
[3:14:49] CantyBloke: KEKW
[3:14:55] Boksa2: does those fire things on map give you stats?
[3:14:57] rtjsdrse903: wtf
[3:15:00] olayni12: wtf
[3:15:01] PhilXaphas: you sure can positively influence it but it's wild to suggest that people with anxiety "just need to fix their lifestyle"
[3:15:04] rtjsdrse903: ????
[3:15:04] blackula84: Yeah oatmeal and beans my guy. Same for me suddenly I was pooping and I freaked out
[3:15:12] BASS186: me 2 T____T
[3:15:17] blackula84: Turns out I was pooping healthy for the first time in 20 years
[3:15:17] chilloriwill: drink 300 ml of oil a day, that is around 2200 kcal
[3:15:21] chilloriwill: You can thank me later
[3:15:46] SovietWrestler: @PhilXaphas It's not wrong. Voluntary exposure tends to help a lot.
[3:15:52] BASS186: I even tried 0 bread and 0 dairy and still poo water
[3:16:03] babaooga: eat a stray dog a day free protein
[3:16:10] rtjsdrse903: damn is guinsoos that bad now
[3:16:18] rtjsdrse903: youre doing better without guinsoos
[3:16:18] olayni12: jgl diff as usual
[3:16:20] chilloriwill: they made eating dogs illegal or some
[3:16:20] CantyBloke: EZ Clap
[3:16:22] KARRmedia: gg
[3:16:30] PhilXaphas: @PhilXaphas it's oversimplified is what it is - I said it can be influenced, not debating that - but it's neither the source nor the cure for many
[3:16:37] blackula84: @teemoshroomsrdumb is right. Fillers like bread are terrible for helping get in calories if you are light eater
[3:17:01] lasagna_thief_69: My lifestyle is not playing Leauge
[3:17:01] nyxsey: !build
[3:17:01] StreamElements: botrk or kraken -> guinsoos -> kraken or botrk -> wits end -> GA - grab some boots somewhere
[3:17:05] Mudpill: ive been agoraphobic since I was like 19, im 31 now. my life is basically over
[3:17:27] Boksa2: every point in life should be balanced. too much or too little is never good
[3:17:29] SovietWrestler: @PhilXaphas It depends on how you define "cure". If it's the difference between being functional in life or not, then it is by definition one.
[3:17:37] blackula84: Fixing your lifestyle helps because their are things you can find that enhance your anxiety and cutting them out or managing them can help. Find your peace and go there. It'll never leave but it'll be better
[3:17:43] Agon_Vi: hey @Cowsep what happened to you playing fighting games to prepare for project L. did you have enough?
[3:18:12] hasuoknife: 3/4/4/4h i see
[3:18:57] Agon_Vi: get a hitbox style contoler. its the best @Cowsep
[3:19:12] PhilXaphas: again, we are in agreement that it has a positive influence - however- there is a lot of toxicity surrounding attitudes that suggest that the person experiencing anxiety does so because "they don't work hard enough for it"
[3:19:47] lasagna_thief_69: Just go touch grass
[3:19:57] Zattara0590: still trying to learn Yi from your streams, thx for the content
[3:19:57] chilloriwill: lasagna aint wrong
[3:20:01] chilloriwill: GO TOUCH GRASS
[3:20:09] diramude: people get offended by nuanced takes like that because then they have to be held accountable
[3:20:09] CantyBloke: i never really comment during the anxiety conversations because i have KKonaW perspectives :)
[3:20:11] SovietWrestler: @PhilXaphas That's a different issue altogether. It's true though.
[3:20:20] BASS186: true
[3:20:23] Doomdmd: I will touch grass
