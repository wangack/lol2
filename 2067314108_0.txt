[4:10:38] eumo_: no resku89
[4:10:50] Spryt_: resku89 depends on the champ
[4:10:59] MelonLordAnna: adc is the most gold reliant role. do you disagree?
[4:11:06] n_e_i_l: @resku89 jungle camps are a lot differnt. anyone other than jungle gets very low xpf rom jungle camps
[4:11:23] resku89: I see, thanks

[4:18:16] n_e_i_l: its just wrong to take camps in most soloq games. you get almost no xp without jungle items. unless its not being farmed for a while or you're actuyally carrying
[4:18:17] GHERKINZ4: sick nerd killer of 100% winrate freshies
[4:18:30] luckyrlz: i'll invade your jungle

[4:18:43] klatterbox: jungle canyon ez
[4:18:47] titas1455: theres a difference when you have rell jungle that functions on 0 gold and hecarim in soloq

[4:18:54] jianjinhai: sick nerd killer of 100% winrate freshies
[4:18:55] MelonLordAnna: What do you mean by farming jgler? Do not all jg champs need to farm
[4:18:58] Acid642: look at draven op gg @Sick_Nerd
[4:18:58] karambit_g: @MelonLordAnna Most of the games played are situational, which means it changes from game to game, there isnt just 1 game state
[4:19:00] n_e_i_l: she gained like 10 xp from that camp. you wouldve gained 100_
[4:19:01] z_3_p: @Sick_Nerd  does B0aty have power of you
[4:19:03] n_e_i_l: +
