[4:10:17] monkeypwnnnn: heca is useless champ tough late
[4:10:19] resku89: Does midlane farm belong to the midlane after 20 minutes in league? that sounds wierd as a dota player
[4:10:38] eumo_: no resku89
[4:10:50] Spryt_: resku89 depends on the champ
[4:10:59] MelonLordAnna: adc is the most gold reliant role. do you disagree?
[4:11:06] n_e_i_l: @resku89 jungle camps are a lot differnt. anyone other than jungle gets very low xpf rom jungle camps
[4:11:23] resku89: I see, thanks
[4:11:32] karmakens: true jgler mentality
[4:11:33] jianjinhai: STOP BEING TILTED BY THAT CAITLYN U FREAK FOCUS ON UR GAME

[4:11:41] pugbox: not the jungle camps BabyRage
[4:11:42] shaukahm: why do league streamers adopt the saying unironically
[4:11:51] MelonLordAnna: @karambit_g yes if you want 10cs/min u take jg camps

[4:18:13] Acid642: honestly looking at other peoples op gg might make you play worse if they are like a gm smurf
[4:18:16] n_e_i_l: its just wrong to take camps in most soloq games. you get almost no xp without jungle items. unless its not being farmed for a while or you're actuyally carrying
[4:18:17] GHERKINZ4: sick nerd killer of 100% winrate freshies
[4:18:30] luckyrlz: i'll invade your jungle
[4:18:40] n_e_i_l: if its something your jungler is going to farm, you never take it
[4:18:43] klatterbox: jungle canyon ez
[4:18:47] titas1455: theres a difference when you have rell jungle that functions on 0 gold and hecarim in soloq

[4:18:54] jianjinhai: sick nerd killer of 100% winrate freshies
[4:18:55] MelonLordAnna: What do you mean by farming jgler? Do not all jg champs need to farm
[4:18:58] Acid642: look at draven op gg @Sick_Nerd
[4:18:58] karambit_g: @MelonLordAnna Most of the games played are situational, which means it changes from game to game, there isnt just 1 game state
[4:19:00] n_e_i_l: she gained like 10 xp from that camp. you wouldve gained 100_
[4:19:01] z_3_p: @Sick_Nerd  does B0aty have power of you
[4:19:03] n_e_i_l: +
