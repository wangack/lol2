[1:48:27] smaugblade: 2 feet
[1:48:39] smaugblade: Auto correct ruined my joke
[1:48:40] Tempsly: Nice
[1:49:00] huaqz: yoooo
[1:49:19] Tempsly: So no kills = buy cull to focus more on farm? *takes notes*
[1:49:19] tyran8r: Do u start W vs Trundle, Trynd and Yone who try to kill u with autos level 1
[1:50:52] Tempsly: Cool\
[1:50:57] hrh_capitano: Trundle is sooo freaking annoying even if you win against him early...
[1:51:06] hrh_capitano: He is like urf champion
[1:51:09] Tempsly: Why does the game say start E when u always start W?
[1:51:43] huaqz: it‚Äôs because it depends on the situation i guess
[1:51:53] givemeawedgie4: @Tempsly he's maxing Q
[1:52:23] Tempsly: I know to max Q first but I was talking about first level @givemeawedgie4
[1:53:18] givemeawedgie4: @Tempsly oh alright
[1:53:47] givemeawedgie4: in that case you can go W or E start
[1:54:04] Tempsly: I always start E cuz the game told me to.
[1:54:16] 1c0n0nly: if you dont mind me asking, what is your favorite sett skin
[1:54:34] Tempsly: No but I trusted the game to know better than me, a newly Sett player :p
[1:54:37] huaqz: @tempsly you use blitz?
[1:54:48] Tempsly: No
[1:54:57] tyran8r: Is the Cleaver buff out yet?
[1:55:12] Tempsly: W do be the chad ability so maybe Ill have to try starting W too :p
[1:55:42] hrh_capitano: W on lvl 1 sett used to be rule when he got first released, that's how i recall it
[1:55:44] givemeawedgie4: blitz? we are sett players here ...
[1:56:00] Tempsly: Nice
[1:56:17] Tempsly: idek what blitz is, is that like porofessor or something
[1:56:42] givemeawedgie4: idk i assumed the champ
[1:56:56] huaqz: @tempsly well im not a pro on sett but i‚Äôd say it depends on the matchup especially if its a ranged then you can go W but if it‚Äôs a melee guy you can easely kill him with E
[1:57:04] Tempsly: Fair
[1:57:21] McQueenIsHere: why don‚Äôt you play malz abynoee
[1:57:28] McQueenIsHere: good ol day when u was malz main

[1:59:07] tyran8r: In desperate need of buffs
[1:59:40] Tempsly: I usually go titanic into sterak, the usual, but I see you're not doing that at all now. Is that just cuz u counter the specific matchup with the corresponding items?
[1:59:49] Ëëâ„ÅÆÂ∞è„Åï„ÅÑ: it‚Äôs true. i can‚Äôt D:

[2:14:35] TiodoPave_1: maaan, I use A LOT of paprika, dolla fitty a MONTH
[2:14:51] lumixier: AMD is always better value if you don't care about RayTracing or DLSS. Rasterization>Nvidia gimmicks imo. But yeah I understand for codecs and stream rendering
[2:14:54] amiro2000: and he easier to update the drivers
[2:14:54] TiodoPave_1: and that's one of the more expensive ones
[2:14:57] amiro2000: it*
[2:15:45] TiodoPave_1: who using ray tracing bro? aut0Deadge
[2:15:47] lumixier: it does BUT not all games support it and it CHUGS performance. i think it needs to mature
[2:15:57] TiodoPave_1: Minecraft is the only good one
[2:16:15] amiro2000: 4090 in cyberpunk with ray tracing fps is like 40 @AutolykusLoL
[2:16:17] amiro2000: KEKW
[2:16:45] TiodoPave_1: @amiro2000 wait cyberpunk runs more than 40 without it?
[2:16:51] TiodoPave_1: that's news to me
[2:17:16] amiro2000: @TiodoPave_1 without ray its 120+fps
[2:17:36] amiro2000: on 4k tho
[2:17:38] lumixier: that's why nvidia relies on DLSS to bridge the gap lol. but i'd still rather encourage devs to proper optimize their games instead of rely on AI frame generation
[2:17:53] TiodoPave_1: I was joking peepoLeave
[2:18:19] amiro2000: in 2k its 200 fps with 4090
[2:18:59] lumixier: yeah it's true. AI is a tool. at this point in time i would rely more on raw output than AI generation
[2:19:04] lumixier: it will get really good soon
[2:19:05] amiro2000: if i get the 4090 i would not even use ray cuz it too powerful for games that heavy
[2:19:19] TiodoPave_1: I am currently at 41% prototype Scoots
[2:19:27] TiodoPave_1: unfortunately the game is short
[2:19:46] TiodoPave_1: @autolykuslol play metal gear rising
[2:19:47] lumixier: tbh i wouldnt use a 4090 at all due to the power draw LMAO bro i dont have time for a fatty power bill
[2:20:20] TiodoPave_1: @autolykuslol why don't u play the spiderman game u were going to play?
[2:20:26] amiro2000: 4080 super should be better then 4080
[2:20:41] amiro2000: even 4080 cost more
[2:21:05] lumixier: are you the kinda dude to run the big ass sword class in RPGs
[2:21:15] TiodoPave_1: the only reason u didn't play was bc copyright and that's not a problem anymore
[2:21:21] TiodoPave_1: aut0G

[2:22:16] Lethorin_lol: I've heard that Cyberpunk is pretty good after years of patches
[2:22:43] amiro2000: @Lethorin_lol i bought the game after 2.0 and put like 350 hours
[2:22:53] amiro2000: its really fun game

[2:26:13] amiro2000: play it
[2:26:33] lumixier: yeah god of war looks good. i dont have a ps5 so i never touched it. i just have a pc lol
[2:26:55] amiro2000: the funny thing is that witcher 3 doesnt have any loading screen vs starfilied
[2:27:51] lumixier: oooh yeah i have yet to play the first one still. i was watching my brother play it, it looks really good actually
[2:28:02] amiro2000: old god of war is insane
