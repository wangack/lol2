[1:41:57] nwa4lifeTV: first item stride or sundered
[1:42:09] iiNumb3rz: I pretty much grt to perma invade low elo. It's golden.
[1:42:15] shadow7master: @しんせんすん his bot reset and enemy was coming
[1:42:32] getsometalentloser: full clear is the consistent options when u don’t know how ur team will respond to things
[1:43:24] iiNumb3rz: You see yikes penta yesterday?
[1:43:39] pepego2: whats a good ban if u main xin?

[1:46:15] nwa4lifeTV: jax/teemo, blind cancels ur q
[1:46:26] nwa4lifeTV: noc blocks your q and fear stops u from winning fights
[1:46:26] iiNumb3rz: My wife bought me rito points for valentines day. I had enough extra to buy one lee sin skin capsule. I bought one and got it lol. Free $200 skin.
[1:46:39] iiNumb3rz: But can confirm it did not give me the 1000 lp you wanted.
[1:46:39] koushik_10: @TabulaRasaVII i thought gave kills to zoe bcz it better on her early
[1:46:50] Caendred: But I feel like xin is such a strong duelist that you can severely impair eve's early game through invades and set her behind for the rest of the game @santorin
[1:47:24] nwa4lifeTV: wife buff
[1:47:44] iiNumb3rz: Evelynn clear. Q q q q q q q q q q q q q

[1:47:58] iiNumb3rz: Gotta replace keyboard after full clear.
[1:48:10] shadow7master: @iiNumb3rz thats life hacks
[1:48:12] EAMS12: evelynn clear isnt that fast ever since jungle item isnt a thing
[1:48:21] EAMS12: and she has to rush sorcs
[1:48:49] Caendred: Yeah I must say catch exp in Jung is insane nowadays. I have games where I took like 4 ennemy camps in early and they end up being one level behind in mid game @santorin
[1:51:16] Lukeskywalkoh: when is it good to pick xin zhao?
[1:51:23] shadow7master: rell is monster in team fights
[1:51:27] basik: @Lukeskywalkoh  during champ select

[2:01:35] Rodacon: Do you think pro players would improve more if there was one balanced patch that lasted for years, like in Starcraft Broodway?
[2:01:39] Rodacon: *Broodwar
[2:02:07] nwa4lifeTV: but starcraft is a better made game than league
[2:02:11] zteixeira: Tay + Shay + ra

[2:02:36] zteixeira: idk hahaha
[2:02:38] Zeiik101: it's not about better made really, it's that they try to freshen it up

[2:04:30] Rodacon: You'd have to pray the first pick knew the OP champ on the patch or you'd lose
[2:04:35] GhostxxHorse: oh wow thats crazy

[2:07:55] HunterericTV: dfg lb was so broken :P
[2:08:24] criticala: I raise you akali with glaive and dfg
[2:08:26] Owlcopwn: dfg ap tristana
[2:08:31] Rodacon: I remember specifically buying DFG because an ADC hated that I kept killing him without it as Syndra, so I made him rage so much for the rest of the game LUL
[2:08:31] jblol94: oracle elixir good old times

[2:17:23] Kai0Shin05: NotLikeThis
[2:18:38] Alveneb: he had no flash

[2:43:17] DJ_Photik: That ksante outplay.. Been seeing him in rank yesterday 😂😂 not the same champ tho in silver
[2:43:28] antisuji: I think one of the only champions that admits they are broken is riven. 'a sword mirrors it's owner'
[2:44:07] blueknight0007: I wanted MAD to win because G2 can bounce back best and i want the wetsern teams to be the strongest possible
[2:44:44] Rodacon: The problem is that it happens so often that the plays don't feel impressive anymore. "Sure, he played well but it's K'Sante"
[2:44:52] Rodacon: It's like 2020 Aphelios
[2:45:16] Post_Maclone: THIS JUST IN - LEC IS BAD - Santorin 2024

[2:48:29] DouglasDrealer: good*
[2:48:40] Rodacon: 2019/20 G2 were EU's absolute peak too, with Fnatic being able to learn from them. Now there's a worse G2 (who are still pretty good) and no team able to learn from G2.

[2:52:50] Rodacon: Reminder to check for ghosting
[2:54:17] september_21st: why did they change it to where your team can't see r pings?
[2:54:20] DJ_Photik: Reminder to check for ghosting
[2:54:41] Rodacon: @september_21st People spam ping others after they die to imply that they suck
[2:54:41] jonasthr1: @september_21st too toxic to ping ur teammates XD

Your positive attitude, combined with your educational approach, is what's been missing recently from most streams and I believe you can cultivate a very positive community! GGs

[3:15:23] binultwitch: how are u doing mr santorin?
[3:15:28] Alveneb: if vanguard can detect scripting then it's a good thing, otherwise just trash Sadge
[3:15:40] Lightpap: honest to god if they add voice comms. rank will become much better and higher quality
[3:15:51] binultwitch: about to do my ranked games so i don't decay before i leave for korea
[3:15:58] eliotxshadowfrost21: Cant believe the LEC stream just up and died yesterday. big oopsie riot lol
[3:16:03] DJ_Photik: Eclipse Sundered Sky Lee game next??, 😎
[3:16:23] DJ_Photik: Isn't there voice comp..
[3:16:42] criticala: @Alveneb My first account got permabanned for allegedly scripting. The ban came after a game I had with blitz 2/8/4 or something.. Idk who saw the gameplay and decided it was scripting. I'd spent so much money on the account for skins too.
[3:17:07] WeCoexist: voice comms are available in almost every game
[3:17:14] ntmadeit: also there is a huge chance that  people would tilt each other in voice comms
[3:17:19] binultwitch: any suggestions for things to do in korea?
[3:17:25] sl1ghtedk1ng: @Santorin is it just me or is BB so much better on G2 than he was on TSM
[3:17:42] shadow7master: how is china super server compared to others
[3:18:21] WeCoexist: what about games like halo or cod where there’s no next round?
[3:18:30] Alveneb: criticala lol never seen a ban due to scripting for 'normal' players, just try sending them a ticket
[3:18:39] binultwitch: tfw my team picks full ad into malph lmfao
[3:18:42] WeCoexist: if you give up power weapons in halo or map control you lose lol
[3:18:48] DJ_Photik: How viable is Mao jg in solo q?
[3:19:11] criticala: @Alveneb This happened 8 years ago. We e-mailed back and forth, they were basically telling me that since it was done by the automated system, it couldn't be undone
[3:19:22] Lockedarsh: heroes of the storm have voice com
[3:19:30] Lightpap: i will be honest it is easier to keep your teammates mental in check. in mny heart of hearts i truly belive ppl aren't that toxic, the lack of communicartion on u guiding ur teammates to win con
[3:19:34] Lightpap: easier to lead
[3:19:39] DJ_Photik: What's the voice chat integrated in league right now then
[3:19:49] Social_Phobia: please dont give league VC... imagine beeing female on league
[3:19:57] Rodacon: @dj_photik duo/flex/party only
[3:20:03] eliotxshadowfrost21: I really gotta wonder, like its understandable why varus is a contended pick but why was senna so prominent in yesterdays matches? the performance of senna on both MDK and G2 was so BAD
[3:20:07] DJ_Photik: Oh ty
[3:20:22] Baker076: it can def go horribly, but sometimes i type a simple message and people think im fuming, if only they could hear my tone
[3:20:23] tori_midnight: @Social_Phobia please no valorant is already so bad
[3:20:37] Princess_Keenny: ^^
[3:20:51] Rodacon: Streaming with League voice chat would be risky as fuck
[3:20:58] Rodacon: Someone would spam slurs
[3:21:08] TobyDuck: i think they should have an option to join voicecoms every game but not force people to use it. Optional
[3:21:50] sl1ghtedk1ng: @Santorin do you think BB is playing much better on G2 than he did on TSM? I feel like hes much better now

[3:37:29] DJ_Photik: Do other abilities do different things in belveth r form?
[3:37:32] Rodacon: You get a specific form from baron/herald compared to regular kills

[3:46:35] xxsoldierboyy: @errawow coming from a otp stride is good now because of the buffs, Witt’s end against a heavy AP squad, BORK is still good against a tank squad bel is pretty situational champ based on builds
[3:48:10] DJ_Photik: Thoughts on Skill Capped or other resources like that for newbies?
[3:48:28] Rodacon: Bel'Veth feels like such a bait pick in pro sometimes

[3:48:55] DJ_Photik: No, one of those paid memberships for videos

[3:49:19] Rodacon: Just find free stuff elsewhere
[3:50:18] DJ_Photik: $6.99/mo knowledge seems worth it. Just all organized for noobs I guess. This is more general knowledge, basics, macro, etc
[3:51:09] larsit0: sort out a coaching please
[3:51:17] sl1ghtedk1ng: are you sponsored by a league companion app? if no then which one do you think is best for a newer player to use in order to get better?

[3:52:53] errawow: yeah vanguard might remove that
[3:52:54] DJ_Photik: Aren't they basically overlays
[3:53:10] moppin_de_ting_yeh: jg timers should be shown in the main client
[3:53:15] Social_Phobia: but it still has to get info from the game ^^
[3:53:20] DJ_Photik: Oh
[3:53:27] sl1ghtedk1ng: broxah said that porofessor will still be allowed after the vanguard starts
[3:53:27] Social_Phobia: im guessing at least
[3:53:30] DJ_Photik: By taking screenshots no?
[3:53:30] Rodacon: It's so weird that Curse Voice was blocked from use because it gave jungle timers when the League game didn't, then years later, apps that give way more info/advantage are usable without any issue from Riot
[3:53:35] cjcunn506: remember the times when u had to type in chat for all timers
