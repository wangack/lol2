[2:26:13] TorqueBandit: while I think you had enough mana for 1 qe, your choice gave your team a benefit... FOUR plates, 1st tower down shortly. so much of league is trade offs.

[3:08:26] thesundereddragon: how do I get god at this game
[3:08:27] via_trita: she's got enough skill to escape, no way she's not trolling
[3:08:36] via_trita: @thesundereddragon stay positive

[3:10:02] Ramex99: maokai has the cosmic rune, thats how he flashes every 4 minutes
[3:11:14] Darkcyter: @Angelyc @doralunaket kaypHello kaypHello
[3:11:18] feralios: Why pick lulu with MF so bad combo
[3:11:20] Ramex99: she is also extremely negative for no reason
[3:11:21] curelinzzi: I thought she had high ping at 1st but this is clear trolling lol
[3:11:21] Sammy_Sam_The_Great: i think lulu is just distracted from whats going on at home
[3:11:30] Sammy_Sam_The_Great: and is just going afk randomly
[3:11:31] Angelyc: @Sammy_Sam_The_Great def not
[3:11:37] Angelyc: @Sammy_Sam_The_Great shes flaming
[3:11:48] doralunaket: well it is what it is rough game for adc placement
[3:11:52] thesundereddragon: also @via_trita thx for the advice
[3:12:03] Jump_Steady: You're playing mf well for having a troll supp
[3:12:12] spoopydoobie: spoopydoobie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 3 months in the basement, it's cozy down here kaypComfy

[3:12:24] JudgeSteven: Classic autofill game
[3:12:44] Galetea: I thought Noc said jungle was easy?
[3:12:45] via_trita: now that i think back, she might've been trolling from the start of lobby, she straight up rejected the pick swap. if i every play sup i always swap with jng/adc for better countering
[3:12:55] Angelyc: when this game is done should look opgg and see the enemy teams main roles
[3:12:56] S17Master: Games like this are why players believe Losers' Queue exist
[3:12:59] Darkcyter: @JudgeSteven kaypHello

[3:16:49] Jump_Steady: What's worse, wet socks or troll teammates?
[3:17:01] via_trita: wet socks
[3:17:05] l4zyL3gz: Was busy for 30 min and now you're adc? How? Haha
[3:17:13] S17Master: @Jump_Steady Troll teammates. You can change out of wet socks pretty fast
[3:17:16] Jump_Steady: Agreed it could always be worse
[3:17:28] lewhitehd69: @KayPea my discover weekly is no longer german techno which is exciting kaypLUL
[3:17:35] spoopydoobie: wet socks is worse, troll team mates happen too often to be as bothersome as wet socks for sure
[3:18:05] via_trita: troll teammates only last a set amount of time, the feeling of wet socks linger in your brain...
[3:18:14] lewhitehd69: @spoopydoobie YES

[3:22:37] via_trita: most toxic trait of small indie companies: "We need money for dev so we can do something to reduce our player count"
[3:22:43] S17Master: League was number 1 game for a very long time
[3:22:49] Frostberg19: sadge :(
[3:22:52] Angelyc: ye
[3:23:10] TomNova: I guess its popular but could have been more if less toxic
[3:23:19] MaybeFunball: I'd get destroyed by the toxicity long before I ever actually learned how to play
