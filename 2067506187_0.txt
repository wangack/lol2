[1:19:54] ChaseShaco: ?
[1:19:54] Nightbot: ¿
[1:20:01] ChaseShaco: use r for clone
[1:20:04] ChaseShaco: if u want to ever be a good shaco
[1:20:09] ToStrife: @fbphilly how is this a hot take lol
[1:20:26] HydraaaCS: @Jiglojay8 we all do
[1:20:26] deltaa2801: ok, ty sm bcs i heard that u use it on alt
[1:20:29] Jiglojay8: i break ankles with leb clone using alt
[1:20:35] deltaa2801: and i was frustraited
[1:22:35] deltaa2801: your fingers are stretched too
[1:22:58] ChaseShaco: even if u prefer alt
[1:23:00] x_presso: sounds made up
[1:23:03] ChaseShaco: force urself to learn r
[1:23:05] Jiglojay8: makes sense. clone is different because you want to stop your char most of the time
[1:23:06] ChaseShaco: its just better
[1:23:10] Jiglojay8: to pretend it's not clone
[1:23:15] Jiglojay8: or clone mb
[1:23:22] Jiglojay8: lb clone
[1:23:22] ChaseShaco: nah theres a lot of different ways to use it
[1:23:25] ChaseShaco: ad is mostly for dps
[1:23:28] deltaa2801: i use r but i was gonna try forcing myself into learning alt if  needed
[1:23:32] ChaseShaco: u need to be able to move urself and clone
[1:23:34] x_presso: I was able to peak masters with ALT
[1:23:34] ChaseShaco: at the same time
[1:23:42] ChaseShaco: thats awesome
[1:23:45] ReignYSK: alt you have to hand stretch too, it’s not worth
[1:23:48] intocablezzzzz: GoldPLZ
[1:23:48] Ruflx: what about map changes what are your thoughts
[1:23:50] ChaseShaco: im not telling you u cant win
[1:23:52] ChaseShaco: with alt
[1:23:52] Lightpap: how u feel abourt voice comms being added to leaue? YAY OR NAY
[1:24:02] ChaseShaco: im saying if you ever want toi play shaco to the limits of the champion
[1:24:04] deltaa2801: y its just suboptimal
[1:24:06] ChaseShaco: r is better
[1:24:16] ChaseShaco: i used alt in the beginning too
[1:24:18] Trickyloll: if i want to play ap shaco what do i build?
[1:24:26] ChaseShaco: u can use alt if u want
[1:24:28] deltaa2801: @Trickyloll you dont play it
[1:24:28] ChaseShaco: i recommend r is all
[1:24:40] deadmoosemeat117: flash smite good?
[1:24:46] ChaseShaco: sure
[1:24:50] ChaseShaco: i cant run flash on shaco
[1:24:56] ChaseShaco: i willflash in place trying to ignite
[1:24:57] ReignYSK: @trickyloll only use ap in jung if they have heavy engage champs
[1:25:00] ChaseShaco: but if u rpefer flash take flash
[1:25:02] ChaseShaco: bothg good
[1:25:05] ReignYSK: otherwise not sorth
[1:25:09] ReignYSK: worth
[1:25:31] deltaa2801: would you still recommend going bork second item always
[1:25:38] ChaseShaco: ye i think its best
[1:25:51] ChaseShaco: i like voltaic when im snowballing and thery are squishy
[1:25:55] ChaseShaco: but 9/10 games
[1:25:57] ChaseShaco: botrk>
[1:26:02] ReignYSK: isn’t Bork only good if they’re tanks, voltaic if squishy?
[1:26:08] ReignYSK: tanky*
[1:26:09] ChaseShaco: nah botrk is best dmg
[1:26:10] ChaseShaco: to all
[1:26:21] ChaseShaco: and slows on first auto]
[1:26:22] ChaseShaco: its good
[1:26:36] ReignYSK: and it has attack speed too right?
[1:26:41] deltaa2801: it does
[1:26:45] harrowxz: do u like briar chase ?
[1:27:09] ReignYSK: do you take voltaic if you’ve got a lead? Is that why you’re building it second?

[1:42:32] Skyz_Ninjaz: @ChaseShaco if I remember correctly, 2-4 grubs is all the same buff so an option is to just take 1 from each spawn to save time
[1:42:34] waterjiggler6200: You need to escape this dog hating elo
[1:42:40] waterjiggler6200: disgusting mutt elo
[1:43:30] waterjiggler6200: he takes 1 grub because the first grub gives 150xp and the rest give 70xp so it’s better to just take 1 and dip and khazix sucks at taking grubs, 1 grub gives more xp than gromp
[1:43:57] duckygoesquaack: @waterjiggler6200 I honestly do that with shaco as well
[1:44:05] duckygoesquaack: I am confused why hes so shocked about that

[1:49:27] DeusExMachinist: @duckygoesquaack quit the game
[1:49:30] DeusExMachinist: xdd
[1:50:21] DeusExMachinist: playing this dogshit isnt worth the psychic damage it deals
[1:51:26] duckygoesquaack: but I got really got at the game.. and I just wanna climb high.. I just cant power through the 21984572 griefed matches like other people can
[1:51:34] DeusExMachinist: Aware
[1:52:12] Cabbage18: knowing that it happens in all elos to even pros makes it sting a little less for me personally
[1:52:16] MigSlayer: cass has the Raid
[1:52:39] Cabbage18: And I just do my best to play well personally and ignore the rest of the team as best I can
[1:53:21] Cabbage18: other option is to find a solid Que partner, I usually browse through ranked history in the elo that I am in and ask a few people to try a game
[1:53:40] Cabbage18: being in a game where you know at least one other lane is TRYING to win can be a huge mental boost
[1:55:14] DeusExMachinist: DIESOFCRINGE
[1:55:24] duckygoesquaack: @Cabbage18 I wish I could do that.. but when I play alone I get extremely tilted and chat restricted all the time.. honor level 0 kinda guy

[1:56:29] duckygoesquaack: @ZangetsuLoL24 have you been here 3 days ago when his teams literally all went 0 30
[1:56:44] duckygoesquaack: I still remember the game against doublelift
[1:56:49] Cabbage18: @duckygoesquaack try to find a good mid or top laner you can duo with and camp their lane
[1:56:57] duckygoesquaack: where he carried so fking hard but his team was just inting and doublelift won by doing nothing
[1:57:40] duckygoesquaack: @Cabbage18 that advice is useless bro.. I am ACE or MVP every game I have no problem carrying. Its just the 0 27 botlane the 2 afks or other troll shit that gets me hyper tilted
[1:58:23] Cabbage18: what's your game name?
