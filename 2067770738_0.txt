[2:45:13] K1SPUK: @FeltmaN and teleport*
[2:45:16] unhingedhatred: @FeltmaN it's fun to play champs that don't only do short trades all the time until ur low hp..
[2:45:27] FeltmaN: @FeltmaN so your a ranged top laner
[2:45:47] ES_Piggy: why is there goku on the floor

[2:47:05] FeltmaN: ww just presses q then leaves his desk
[2:47:08] K1SPUK: atleast you need to hit some skills with this chapms unhingedhatred
[2:47:10] FeltmaN: and still wins the trade
[2:47:19] unhingedhatred: @FeltmaN they all want to all in every chance they get and not do short trades riven 2.0 style
[2:47:31] unhingedhatred: @K1SPUK "skills"

[2:48:00] Seraxx2g: I try to learn aatrox but idk every matchup feels so hard i normaly play emerald but with aatrox i even strugle in silver XD its crazy  hope to learn something^^
[2:48:00] FeltmaN: naayil made my point for me
[2:48:19] ES_Piggy: warwick still has some kind of skill expression, but he hard counters aatrox so this lane is not rly playable
[2:48:20] globglob123123: i found a guts custom skin for aatrox
[2:48:32] pafrut: what are we thinking about aftershock aatrox?
[2:48:41] FeltmaN: @ES_Piggy aatrox counters ww but the champ is stronger than anything in a 1v1
[2:48:45] italianspongebob: XDDDD
[2:48:46] FeltmaN: at least in the laning
[2:48:48] 16kayto: XDD

[2:49:20] ES_Piggy: @FeltmaN for example with sett you just try to play with small trades and disengage
[2:49:22] FeltmaN: you dont feed ww and hope your team isnt dogpoo
[2:49:22] mizzy_h: @K1SPUK needs a brain if u can abuse him

[2:50:34] pafrut: when are you playing grasp aatrox?

[5:33:21] RandomLemonMan: sylas adc????????
[5:33:21] atladas123: If you buy hydra then you still can't fight him but you can perma clear waves
[5:33:23] raphael31410: its zed on roids xdd
[5:33:24] swisslion2806: an assasin/
[5:33:24] draco_silence: Isn’t the only redeeming factor about K’sante is he’s hard to pilot properly?
[5:33:25] swisslion2806: ?
[5:33:29] smart595: !elo
[5:33:30] LoLRankBot: NAAYIL is Challenger  762 LP (Solo/Duo)

[5:33:44] RandomLemonMan: y u have sylas adc lmao
[5:33:46] legend_ahmed: Do you think nerfing lethal tempo was too much because it was more like a Yone problem more than a lethal problem
[5:33:48] staineeer: why they play lethality? it sucks
[5:33:52] 3dopy4: @Komlin111 Profane Hydra works good with Aatrox's A combo
[5:33:53] mrkokos_hd: but the ksante changes are so good
[5:33:53] Zepplll: @Naayil just not get ulted by him ...

[5:35:21] OskarG88: i have mental block vs fiora lol
[5:35:25] MasterSartor: @randomlemonman Well Vayne is atleast easy to take down if caught, you dont want to fight Ksante
[5:35:31] draco_silence: I’m not arguing at all btw @naayil is just what I heard, but I’ve tried him and he’s very hard right now pilot for most people, especially in lower elo. I feel like riven and fiora are way easier to deal with and they actually take damage, unlike K’sante
[5:35:34] repIica02: buy krakenslayer
[5:35:35] Zlimeeee: isnt he a counter to aatrox then?

[5:39:57] w0xell_: see counter to ksante is the jgl gap
[5:39:57] OskarG88: MODS
[5:40:04] HunterBl4z3: why doesnt riot think about deleting champs
[5:40:06] draco_silence: I know it would upset people and what not. But they should remove champs they can’t balance and just people back the RP they spent on the skins
[5:40:22] 16kayto: @HunterBl4z3 some people will get mad
[5:40:28] draco_silence: @hunterbl4z3 lol get out of my head my guy

[5:41:21] atladas123: But you have comet, you can't see if swifts are good
[5:41:25] MasterSartor: Next champ: Ksante but he is immune to Magic/physical dmg and he has a passive like Evelynn 6, + his kit now
[5:41:27] orhannberkk: @swisslion2806 u r so true btw
[5:41:31] edojeje: has naayil said something bout podcast new episode?
[5:41:39] gabrielwasneverhere10: riot added an item that describes solo q called unending despair it heals a ton
[5:41:45] swisslion2806: like even hwei isnt right
[5:41:59] swisslion2806: her cds are too short in the early game for a mage that doesnt use almost any mana
[5:42:04] pan_con_chicharr0n: @edojeje they are releasing it weekly, all i heard
[5:42:12] cheezballz2lol: did he win last agame
[5:42:24] RandomLemonMan: @cheezballz2lol yes
[5:42:25] estluckyde20: Why comet against k'sante? Doesn't leaves you without damage?
[5:42:29] w0xell_: you need to try exhaust bro
[5:42:30] draco_silence: @tedduuu or do what they do with zed, make him extremely high skill cap and weak, except for in pro play. Cause the game is balanced more around pro play than it is anything else unfortunately

[5:42:57] orhannberkk: @Naayil ksante designer was not fired, he is head of the champ designer team lol xd
[5:42:59] MasterSartor: Nasus be like: Q Meanwhile every other champ released after 2022: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP

[5:43:18] inGameTRAGEDY: i mean u have lot of magic dmg and hes forced to buy armor
[5:43:28] PcLerdo: He land a Q on you and his "slow" root you in place
[5:43:29] raphael31410: scorch EZ
[5:43:37] dkx74: Maybe swifties conq
[5:43:38] ranged_v2: are they reverting back the build path for cleaver?
[5:43:46] colodos: need replay research
[5:43:51] mrkokos_hd: its the nullifying orb it blocked 31 dmg
[5:44:01] iiTzZoanx: Swifties it is
[5:44:20] draco_silence: @ranged_v2 it needs a buff, not a revert
[5:44:25] PILMOCO: after the all out Q nerf, i dont think youll need the swifties
[5:44:27] inGameTRAGEDY: and they are cheap too
[5:44:41] zeniacWalker: Might be Phage + Swifties
[5:44:45] ranged_v2: @draco_silence yeah i agree but current build path is insanely bad

[5:45:20] gabrielwasneverhere10: dead man's
[5:45:23] JerryPlayzGames: so that might have helped
[5:45:24] iiTzZoanx: Why a top paner when I can become pseudo ranged Ms abuser lol
[5:45:24] w0xell_: so why not go phase rush for even more ms
[5:45:27] gabrielwasneverhere10: only move speed
[5:45:33] RandomLemonMan: have you tried aftershock into ksante?
[5:45:36] gabrielwasneverhere10: he can't do anything if he can't hit you
[5:45:39] hasan7v7: so swifties is the savior for this matchup?
[5:45:42] PcLerdo: Face rush? maybe?
[5:45:43] berlinx03: comet into ksante????????
[5:45:44] inGameTRAGEDY: and W too
[5:45:58] mrkokos_hd: it was to be phaserush then

[5:46:12] gabrielwasneverhere10: who supports giving aatrox an actuall w ability
[5:46:17] w0xell_: so ksante is basically olaf lul

[5:46:39] colodos: all needed is just embrace ranged toplane features
[5:47:01] RotNroll: wait till he has gauntlet tho, it might change
[5:47:02] draco_silence: @ranged_v2 Meh, build paths don’t bother me much, but nerfing black cleaver and syrildas grudge hurt a lot of top laners to be able to do damage to tanks late game. Like last night I could deal any damage to this cho gath, my mid and adc had to kill him, I was just frontline

[7:08:58] darkrooster1: Yo naayil is ravenous hydra first item any good on aatrox?
[7:08:58] PcLerdo: @MasterSartor I think i will get ban
[7:09:00] inGameTRAGEDY: if they were to remove yorick only yorick players would me mad
[7:09:06] thedreadfulgamer64: Downloaded the movie
[7:09:08] inGameTRAGEDY: that explains a lot
[7:09:19] kawai_desu02: why does Zeus go it then
[7:09:36] pomorato1: Is ap aatrox a legit pick ?
[7:09:42] layka2g: When do i build profane first item?
[7:09:44] nomadovsky: @Naayil can you do a champion difficulty tier list for top lane wanted to see your opinion
[7:09:56] ShuIkin: idk why zeus goes lethality, i tried it many times and its almost in any case worse than sunderer
[7:09:58] darkrooster1: Do you think Sundered Sky should be nerfed?
[7:10:15] NightShado81: @naayil anychance BC is viable second after changes?
[7:10:17] kerreal1: dfhjkgdsfa
[7:10:17] layka2g: Hahaha
[7:10:35] MasterSartor: what about unending dispair?
[7:10:40] inGameTRAGEDY: they are buffing cleaver
[7:10:40] jackson122312: nah these people cant be saying "lethality better because zeus", zeus team is so good he can get away with AP aatrox probably
[7:10:42] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[7:10:46] darkrooster1: I mean I think the only reason aatrox is any good is because of sundered sky no?
[7:10:50] layka2g: is ga good ? Or i go for dd
[7:11:04] slk_thegodofbat: i swear i took 10 ads back to back
[7:11:09] therockcena99: You should check out the gator vid
[7:11:15] coztobi: biggest counter to aatrox?
[7:11:22] inGameTRAGEDY: do you think the black cleaver buff will make the match up playable?
[7:11:39] darkrooster1: I saw your short lol about twisted fate ghosting haha
[7:11:40] vedzoid: Have u tried voltaic cyclosword vs ranged matchups?
[7:11:47] RaffiChanLoL: murrica xD that gun
[7:11:48] mhrocha: Don't forget Master Yi
[7:11:54] PcLerdo: GA is bad. Naayil already say that on a video. The only bruisers that go GA, they are in pro play
[7:11:55] darkrooster1: Yeah ghost has to be nerfed
[7:11:57] jackson122312: bro what about the most fun matchup? the kind of matchup that you know gets you up in your chair a bit and looking forward to play it
[7:12:10] PcLerdo: When you need to respond or your team will respond to something
[7:12:13] pomorato1: Ye true
[7:12:24] pomorato1: I hate that riot nerfs champs because of Pro play
[7:12:24] layka2g: Skill matchups?
[7:12:25] smart595: When was the time that BC good?
[7:12:27] terorr1st: but pro play is nowhere close to solo q builds
[7:12:32] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[7:12:43] thedreadfulgamer64: Fr you guys shouldnt try to copy proplay
[7:12:56] kerreal1: once upon a time aatrox had 2 stacks of e... good times.
[7:12:57] darkrooster1: Well in pro play money is on the line so I assume they would be more conserative with their plays
[7:13:00] PcLerdo: True same thing you said that on the video haha
[7:13:02] therockcena99: That’s how I feel about zhonyas a lot of the time
[7:13:04] PcLerdo: Is so true
[7:13:09] pomorato1: Like they legit nerf champions because they are bad for pro play what does that even mean ?
[7:13:15] pan_con_chicharr0n: Yo...Proplay is a different game. You have 0 communication with your teammates, you dont farm 40 mins. Its not the same game
[7:13:26] cuonghydratech: @naayil what is your favourite matchup as aatrox?(for fun)
[7:13:29] alexrohirrim95: well sunder sky rush in jungle is 4ss in solo que .

[7:15:54] pan_con_chicharr0n: 800 lp coming soon
[7:16:01] darkrooster1: Honestly aatrox is only viable because of sundered sky
[7:16:21] 420HEX: gn
[7:16:27] darkrooster1: Like riven can do 5000 damage per auto and they would probably still nerf aatrox lol
[7:16:36] pomorato1: Nah it's because nayiil is too broken and they nerfed him with a aatrox ban
[7:16:45] pomorato1: I'm glazing too much
[7:16:46] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[7:17:08] jerome_diazzz: W STREAM
[7:17:08] darkrooster1: Yeah they will nerf aatrox not sundered sky which is actually what is keeping aatrox broken
[7:17:23] darkrooster1: W
