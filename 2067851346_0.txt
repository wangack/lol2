[1:45:39] EricC1001: yeah I was looking at that glare looking thing. Some new champion teaser?
[1:46:19] Lazynameross: i figured its glare or something from mordes skin displaying in the wrong place
[1:47:11] phunktional: @Lazynameross I think you're right, it was following morde's movements
[1:47:24] Lazynameross: iirc kalista had a problem like this
[1:47:40] metalwrath22222: its synced with morde movements, must be from the skin
[1:47:43] goffrie: what the hell

[3:38:18] cuscus9214: ptsd
[3:38:28] matheusgusmao00: i played this and i didn't like it
[3:38:41] matheusgusmao00: this set up
[3:44:15] SvG_Hokage: last stand is only good for shrooms when you are dead
[3:52:47] hashtagzongrips: Harder condition
[4:02:25] Lazynameross: is it realistic she lands all qs?
[4:03:49] Lazynameross: but you used a q on nothing just then
[4:12:47] Lazynameross: she adaptive over cdr shard?
[4:17:13] knowndepth: 2 potions with D-ring tho
[4:19:43] Lazynameross: i dont play either champ but im just making sure: dagger start is terrible idea?
[4:22:53] knowndepth: overheal gives 0.4 shield per auto at lvl 1, on teemo with D-blade
[4:23:32] LetTheScoutCook: just came,, whats going on
[4:23:53] Lazynameross: figuring how to handle riven out the gate
[4:24:36] 514484: LUL
[4:24:46] 514484: PogBones
[4:26:02] Lazynameross: revitalize with dblade+pots?
[4:27:28] Lazynameross: are you using the last stand during fight
[4:27:42] Lazynameross: it would be 10% around that time
[4:28:38] Lazynameross: increased revitazile overlapping with last stand activation
[4:28:50] Lazynameross: rip my spelling
[4:29:07] netherking128: more dmg = more healing
[4:29:24] netherking128: theoretically
[4:29:38] hashtagzongrips: It’s like 1 hp lol
[4:29:41] cuscus9214: 11% of 60 is 6 and 5% of that 6 is no healing
[4:30:09] netherking128: but last stand million times better than coup
[4:30:14] netherking128: especially in a scenario like htat
[4:30:16] netherking128: either way
[4:30:58] LetTheScoutCook: just go riftmaker
[4:31:51] netherking128: yes
[4:31:51] cuscus9214: overgrowth gives actual hp level 2 3 and on
[4:31:58] netherking128: main deal is level 1
[4:31:59] netherking128: tho
[4:32:00] LetTheScoutCook: riftmake beats nashor and liandry first item if u are able to poke
[4:32:04] cuscus9214: unflinching works only with cc
[4:32:22] cuscus9214: so riven can proc it
[4:32:42] cuscus9214: unless u wanna do shield bash overheal n the healing from green
[4:32:46] cuscus9214: which is troll
[4:32:51] cuscus9214: it's to be safe
[4:33:19] netherking128: probably won't lol
[4:33:24] netherking128: maybe like 1-3 healing
[4:33:28] cuscus9214: u better hv celerity n gathe4ing storm
[4:33:35] Lazynameross: its not to be much
[4:33:36] netherking128: would be nice if teemo e applied lifesteal
[4:33:38] netherking128: shame it doesn't
[4:33:40] EdRow: why not ms?
[4:33:43] cuscus9214: u zooming out of riven  is good to be alive
[4:33:50] Lazynameross: its the moments of like 3hp diff/1hit
[4:34:21] richieecoool: yorick gonna be annoyin
[4:34:32] cuscus9214: ah u mean lv1 not the whole lane
[4:34:39] Lazynameross: this smolder ign OMEGALUL
[4:34:49] netherking128: (ye thats what I said)
[4:34:50] avabbyy: is yorick scary?
[4:34:57] cuscus9214: in that case the qdaptive that gives 60hp could work
[4:35:07] netherking128: good yoricks can be a little bit
[4:35:16] netherking128: but most aren't
[4:36:04] Lazynameross: its to scrap level 1
[4:36:14] Lazynameross: they already gonna nerf tech
[4:38:33] Lazynameross: do yorick ghouls stack overgrowth
[4:38:53] richieecoool: hes missing his e alot
[4:39:11] netherking128: thats how the matchup goes
[4:39:27] netherking128: either he hits e or you dodge it
[4:39:30] richieecoool: LUL
[4:39:40] netherking128: if you get hit you lose
[4:39:42] netherking128: if you don't you win
[4:39:43] goffrie: stand still -> get speared
[4:39:44] richieecoool: good yorick rarely miss e
[4:39:51] netherking128: nah they do
[4:40:04] netherking128: they just make themselves more unpredictable
[4:40:05] lokken_tak: it's more on the opponent to dodge
[4:40:16] netherking128: and iPavs point is exactly the thing
[4:40:18] Lazynameross: cant you just deathwall people into the e
[4:40:26] netherking128: teemo shouldn't get hit to begin wiht
[4:40:27] netherking128: optimally
