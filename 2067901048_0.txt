[1:01:57] DirtyKimchi: imagine playing poe without stash tabs LuL
[1:01:59] Redfactor3: @Borarlos if you want to go beyond white/yellow u probably have to pay for stash

[1:02:33] rayldb: hi
[1:02:37] Kithlan: @PervySageCertified Yeah, but that's like a one time $20 thing, isn't it?
[1:02:37] nekroz2k: @SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI nah. its you pay once a league(season) if you really want to, which is usually 40-50. Then you can resell most stuff anyways, but for a bit less i assume
[1:02:40] Retsi21: maybe he didn't have cds?
[1:02:40] rockpopjazz: hello
[1:02:44] Redfactor3: @Kithlan correct
[1:02:47] AirTotten: PRObelter
[1:02:49] PervySageCertified: @Kithlan true

[1:03:06] davenotdavid7: redeemed?
[1:03:09] SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI: couldn't really get into it Cluegi
[1:03:21] Borarlos: @SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI bro i think you are thinking about diablo 3
[1:03:36] Borarlos: but path of exile is literally the most diverse game i have ever played
[1:03:40] PervySageCertified: @SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI not wrong
[1:03:43] kappa3600: xdd xdd
[1:03:52] AirTotten: Sylas is so good, but I feel like its so easy to get in to trouble with him too lol
[1:03:52] Redfactor3: @SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI its not pay 2 "play" like lost ark, but you will probably have to spend like 20-50 bucks on it once you beat the story and want to start doing max level content
[1:04:18] SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI: thanks peepoHappy
[1:04:33] Borarlos: @Redfactor3 you will probably WANT to spend it, but it is completely up to you
[1:04:41] Borarlos: stash tabs are SOOOO good but not mandatory at all
[1:04:48] PervySageCertified: @Borarlos you dont have acces to sell stuff unless you buy the tab
[1:04:56] Borarlos: @PervySageCertified yes you do? lol
[1:04:56] zeroofdark123: peepoHappy
[1:04:57] sncwy_g: 20€ max on stash tabs is all u need. its a one time buy
[1:04:59] Redfactor3: I think you can get like.... 15-30h? f2p from poe depending on how long you take on campaign and how many different classes you want to try out through the campaign
[1:05:12] Baggyyyyyyyyy: I got 1500 hours from poe on about $30, double price d4 got me about 40 hrs
[1:05:20] Borarlos: @PervySageCertified you can sell stuff with premium tabs, it is just very much harder
[1:05:26] tearagion: map tab keeps u sane, currency tab is big value, rest is gravy, traeding is for losers
[1:05:34] zeroofdark123: chat i've been procrastinating what should i do peepoSad
[1:05:50] SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI: whip it out Cluegi
[1:05:51] mrmikeT: do one task at a time
[1:05:51] PervySageCertified: @tearagion trading makes u mirrors
[1:05:58] sncwy_g: im actually playing every league without map tab.. playing endgame and doing challenges everytime
[1:06:06] tearagion: mirrors make you a loser
[1:06:07] vvartin: if ur thinking of playing poe take a look and last epoch
[1:06:07] ggDemeno: @zeroofdark123 What are you procrastinating on?
[1:06:07] nekroz2k: @tearagion Concerned
[1:06:10] sncwy_g: its not the best but it works. map tab expensive
[1:06:12] tearagion: just play the game and kill bosses
[1:06:13] Zweepers: @zeroofdark123 set a timer for 15 min, work for 15 min.
[1:06:18] ceylend: @zeroofdark123 set a timer on your phone and do 15 minutes of work on whatever you need to do, then take a break. Usually its just starting is the hard part for me
[1:06:26] Redfactor3: @tearagion dont yuck people's yum, trading made poe way more enjoyable for me. For people who have an idea of what build they want to play and dont really enjoy "playing out of what you get" trading is nice

[2:40:50] tonnyy4i: the jax was fill i guess
[2:40:53] theArambulance: @auzreal i think it works in pro because they want to stall playing a infinite scaler and the adc has better mechanics than the support player so they give it to them

[2:44:30] friendlyguy19: NotLikeThis TwitchConHYPE PopNemo
[2:44:37] FistShapedBumCorK: @Gods_Favorit3 her winrate is 54% without tahm as adc, not starving. idk why or how but that's what it says

[3:50:09] marios7ftw: ....
[3:50:13] marios7ftw: ..,
[3:50:15] Classic112: @Ludis_Shaed on damage supports you can go dorans ring too or even tanks can go dorans shield if you plan on hard all-in
[3:50:27] Redfactor3: @Ludis_Shaed he aint going ap wat?
[3:50:27] HalcyonDays: I swear you are never actually on Spicas team
[3:50:43] haorli: guma yussy KEKWait
[3:50:53] lightsza: Its blood bath god dam
[3:50:59] Ludis_Shaed: @Classic112 damn thats such an interesting strat... is this new patch or just in general and i never watch support streamers lmao
[3:51:03] wiima_dicfit: oner or boner xdd
[3:51:10] mcegginton: gg
[3:51:14] rawzool: wow that flick
[3:51:15] Ludis_Shaed: @Redfactor3 oh he isnt? idk man i just assume so since support, but yea i guess blade is weird then agree
[3:51:16] Cougar_Life: good evening gang daphSit
[3:51:32] Classic112: the support item doesn't start giving stacks until the middle of wave 2 now @Ludis_Shaed
[3:51:44] evolution249: flaming oner
[3:51:51] Ludis_Shaed: @Classic112 is this regardless of when you buy it? like its a fixed timer?
[3:51:58] Zweepers: @ludis_shaed any champs lately, I’ve seen Doran shield start for Naut, Doran ring start for karma, just the extra health in the early lane to sustain through til first back is what I’m seeing supps do
[3:52:11] mohamedtonpere: its t45 now
[3:52:27] Cougar_Life: the sound effect on that ezreal skins ult is insane
[3:52:28] grand_rizzard: grand_rizzard is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Pobelter's community! They've gifted a total of 21 in the channel! 
[3:52:29] grand_rizzard: grand_rizzard gifted a Tier 1 sub to cullinggameshibuyaarc! 
[3:52:38] felicosiano: kinda balanced they have cody sun spica and you have nunu KEKWait
[3:52:47] Zweepers: especially after the supp items got nerfed
[3:52:50] Classic112: yeah, fixed time. so if you get an early all in level 1/2 because of it you can insta back and buy it and have all 3 stacks.
[3:52:50] Redfactor3: @Ludis_Shaed the idea is that you want to fight them early and be able to pressure them enough to make up for not having support item gold. Hence doran blade lvl 1. The rest is the same as any support ashe build, which is usually just lethality
[3:52:59] BosMoQrl: Pog
[3:53:04] Milkshake_Dangerous: zay-us

[3:53:15] homelanderisatroll: tea 1 ?
[3:53:26] Ludis_Shaed: @Zweepers yea makes sense now, never saw it before. seems like because support item doesnt start giving stacks till later... but is that timer based on game time, or when you purchase item?
[3:53:39] Ludis_Shaed: @Redfactor3 yea cool strat honestly, makes sense now thanks homie
[3:54:43] Zweepers: @ludis_shaed I’m not entirely sure about the supp item stacking tbh
[3:55:04] Classic112: its timed

[5:18:27] jordanmon18: like wtf is all those shields and knock ups
[5:18:29] efirestorm: one of the changes is that his q doesnt slow anymore when he ulted @Pobelter
[5:18:31] Tooldealer: The ult has to go
[5:18:31] Myattathotep: He never gets nerfed, it's always reworks.
[5:18:32] pingkytwitch: he'll be weaker for sure

[5:18:46] SantiAckerman: next patch is another bugg guys
[5:18:47] iamnolan4: the adjustments are not just a buff, he's losing dash distance and his q wont slow thats a big difference
[5:18:47] NoxianSion: can't find a middle way he gets too weak after nerf or too strong after buff
[5:18:50] pingkytwitch: just insta solo kill in every pro game
[5:18:51] theArambulance: they are getting rid of his ult q slows at least
[5:18:53] Derek_NA: his kit is busted
[5:18:55] TalesNT: He can't have 2 patches in a row without being OP

[5:23:42] korenir: The level diff is huge to be fair
[5:23:42] Suplazin: why is he not played or banned every game
[5:23:50] CannonmanG: aoe cc :)
[5:23:54] xg32: @Pobelter whats the thought process when hes open in pro play
[5:23:57] Tooldealer: He becomes a drain tank with more damage
[5:23:57] niclasobrovac: The fact that Tanks are outdamaging others while being unkillable is just the complete opposite of what a tank is supposed to be
[5:23:59] Elpasoslife: he's literally just olaf 10x OMEGALUL
[5:23:59] fatpep: learn him :)
[5:24:00] Derp_sanity: ksante is so OP! bans senna

[5:28:15] pingkytwitch: dark harvest does more valuable damage though, electrocute procs at full HP but DH only procs at low hp, so higher chance to kill
[5:28:17] AphelionSnow: @Cougar_Life You can usually pop it a couple times in a fight if you're playing with your range.

[5:31:23] ashugru: don't drink pee bro
[5:31:32] Cougar_Life: well tyler1 was banned for a good chunk of time
[5:31:38] pingkytwitch: it's not really mental honestly, i think after enough games you become numb to everything

[5:33:08] Nachooup: a
[5:33:17] theArambulance: i'm guessing because it's a single digit number maybe
[5:33:20] pingkytwitch: because not small
[5:33:29] Cougar_Life: surely you and the jg can capitalize on this huge cs lead right
[5:33:29] takedown79: Bedge
