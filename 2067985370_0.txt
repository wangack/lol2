[4:07:31] yahster_: my top champ pool is aatrox vayne, anyone you think i should add?
[4:07:39] qmachine69: Whos gameplay is this
[4:07:44] heincken: ww is such a stupid a champ
[4:07:46] loddenfps: how do you beat nasus as fiora when he slows you for like 100%
[4:08:07] kylerarc: @loddenfps tenacity
[4:08:31] brsu: what about illaoi tho

[4:09:11] AlexBloomm: i feel like jax just takes to many items to be a champion
[4:09:17] kylerarc: i think fiora. maybe jax hes super meta resistant
[4:09:18] jaximus8: Jax not as good anymore. i was jax main for years but now i main fiora
[4:09:20] qmachine69: @rmsprowler u have to be good at her for her to be good

[6:28:54] gaurwashii: small trades into all in @ZombieMechanics  you have to bait the riposte with your third q, either hold it or use it in a weird direction close to her

[8:48:32] the1realslimshady: told you garen is broken
[8:48:42] Lemax222: Another question for the chat, could it be that now when you press E 3rd Q the Q comes out faster than before?
[8:48:46] the1realslimshady: look at his fucinh hp
[8:49:05] Yinkz1: thats fun
[8:49:15] G1Papas: @Lemax222 it's called animation cancelling

[10:23:55] squidmilk_: @viper have you noticed that renekton actually has a 51% with eclipse rush, people are just building him wrong , sundered sky doesn't even work with his w
[10:24:21] Voxtrik: how u doing
[10:24:38] Voxtrik: it used to not work on his W
[10:24:38] squidmilk_: Renekton w can't crit no matter what
[10:24:43] Voxtrik: i think that they made it work though
[10:24:45] squidmilk_: And you don't get the healing either
[10:24:54] squidmilk_: Maybe I haven't tried it this patch
[10:25:06] Voxtrik: it got fixed on illaoi W
[10:25:17] MpraWins: Is it bugged or that's how it should work tho
[10:25:19] Voxtrik: im so pumped to play him again
[10:25:21] Voxtrik: LETS GOO
[10:25:25] MpraWins: Yea they want it to be meta
[10:25:30] lolkotek: vipeCry
[10:25:32] MpraWins: Good for proplay
[10:25:33] Voxtrik: yeah it'll be me bucko
[10:25:36] Contractz: True
[10:25:50] ThirstyCanine: renekton getting some love tho finally
[10:25:54] vicoixyz: looks like the vayne will be meta too then :)
[10:25:55] shararr1: el contrato Pog
[10:26:02] Voxtrik: did you find out the vayne buidl btw?
[10:26:15] Contractz: AP JUNGLERS unleashed
[10:26:42] squidmilk_: Renekton surprisingly has a lot of auto cancels
[10:27:09] Voxtrik: yeah sundered works on his W now
[10:27:32] MpraWins: But you always see riven one tricks XD
[10:27:35] Voxtrik: get palco out of my games please!
[10:27:43] MpraWins: Bcs it's good in the meta Kappa
[10:28:00] barakiel_sama: COPIUM
[10:28:07] Voxtrik: stride first into gnar i like it picasso
[10:28:09] k1nggggggtop: nah it's you that can play her so fine
[10:28:25] Voxtrik: i think the changes are actually buffs for elos below like GM
[10:28:34] MpraWins: I mean his r form is nerfed the rest is just getting omegabuffed
[10:28:36] deathgold32: gragas om
[10:28:55] haxrnobb: is there any high elo singed players?
[10:29:03] besix98: irelia?
[10:29:05] k1nggggggtop: marvin1v9 @haxrnobb
[10:29:08] Voxtrik: E max second on this guy btw is interesting
[10:29:31] MpraWins: Is Marvin even high anymore?
[10:29:32] Voxtrik: against gnar i think good
[10:29:35] squidmilk_: Stridebreaker does give an insane 450 hl
[10:29:38] squidmilk_: Hp
[10:29:43] haxrnobb: they're both EU tho is there any good ones in NA?
[10:29:45] quacheck: karma gragas ksante NOTED
[10:29:45] Voxtrik: oh that's gryffin the ex NA rank 1
[10:29:47] Voxtrik: the leesin
[10:29:48] k1nggggggtop: i think marvin is gm now
[10:29:49] quacheck: climb
[10:29:53] MpraWins: I know he got chall early when every game was a fiesta bcs people were trying to learn the map but what about now?
[10:29:56] Voxtrik: it slows them and speeds u up
[10:30:01] Contractz: the stride breaker on this patch is bugged
[10:30:05] Contractz: but fixed next patch
[10:30:16] MpraWins: What's the bug
[10:30:21] Voxtrik: doesn't always slow, right?
[10:30:23] Contractz: the decaying ms wears off like 1.5s faster than its supposed to i think
[10:30:31] MpraWins: Ahh
[10:31:01] squidmilk_: It does give alot of stats
[10:31:04] MpraWins: We might see sett more no?
[10:31:07] Contractz: ya offday LMAO
[10:31:32] Contractz: i dont think itll be built a lot still kinda meh item
[10:31:32] Vesatile: How is Riven into Camille?
[10:31:33] squidmilk_: @mprawins it's a tiamat item, meaning sett can't build both Titanic hydra and stridebreaker so it kinda sucks
[10:31:41] Contractz: ya relaxing is nice
[10:31:44] Voxtrik: i think it's good for a lot of the melee vs ranged tops
[10:31:46] jtjm47: yone will be dead with lethal tempo nerfs
[10:31:48] Contractz: u know the feel
[10:31:49] Contractz: thx bro

[10:31:54] lolkotek: true
[10:31:59] Voxtrik: renekton vs quinn vayne gnar jayce etc
[10:32:04] MpraWins: @squidmilk_ yea but when stride was op sett was op too
[10:32:08] MpraWins: So who knows

[10:32:59] WheresMyVirginity: you used to be aatrox player
[10:33:03] squidmilk_: I hate the pantheon matchup on renekton
[10:33:35] gus_from_berk: is riven squishy or am i ass
[10:33:41] G1Papas: bro is on a script xd
[10:33:47] MpraWins: @squidmilk_ Shield bash/unflinching+ bone plating makes matchup better
[10:33:59] stevestovestuve: when jayce got buffed season 7 he was literally the best early game champ, I got two accs almost mid diamond so easily back then as a jayce main lol
[10:34:12] gus_from_berk: ok so just skill issue then
[10:34:15] ounceoffloof: he gamble ezreal greed movment

[10:34:21] MpraWins: @squidmilk_ but I prefer to believe I'm better than the panth and just dodge his red q and all in
[10:35:01] WheresMyVirginity: you got a darius
[10:35:02] WheresMyVirginity: lmao
[10:35:12] squidmilk_: @mprawins I agree that after 6 you beat him but it's just hard not to get behind pre 6 , he can save w for your e so you can't ever buffer your w into his w
[10:35:22] Maspian: huhh
[10:35:51] Clinwe: Does tenacity works against suppress?
[10:35:56] vicoixyz: ayo whats so wrong with a diamond player? vipeGG vipeGG vipeGG
[10:36:01] k1nggggggtop: nope @Clinwe
[10:36:06] Clinwe: I thought it didn't
[10:36:08] k_legendar: Hey Viper. Are you currently going Profane/Eclipse into Sundered sky every game?
[10:36:10] MpraWins: Suppress only gets countered by qss
[10:36:18] Clinwe: @k1nggggggtop oh, I see
