[6:58:58] DrunKev: I'd say ez should go FH but with the frontline he has and the garen threat, grudge or shojin prob better option
[6:59:06] DrunKev: especially vs garen threat
[6:59:44] DrunKev: yeah FH sucks against garen exactly

[7:55:23] fatguy925: smiteHmm
[7:55:37] LordAudacity: I think that Sona game was unwinnable- your adc solo ran it down 5 times in a row and blamed jungle
[7:55:59] fatguy925: Senna needs a lane dominator, true

[8:04:39] Onionknight47: @wigglepus it's probably good in lane vs ADC supports and good for the first grubs fight
[8:04:50] Onionknight47: I have no idea what the champ is meant to do after that point
[8:06:16] d3afhead: did he cancel his ult?
[8:06:20] Onionknight47: probably trying to run back into the cove would be better

[8:08:40] Onionknight47: idk felt like there wasn't much you could do
[8:08:45] Onionknight47: camille has an eclipse somehow
[8:09:03] LordAudacity: Camille is the best support
