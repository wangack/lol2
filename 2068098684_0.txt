[1:03:06] yanya7701: is this guy Australian
[1:03:11] PapaSmithy: yes
[1:03:53] SourEggs: Joseph and spookz are sitting awfully close together
[1:03:59] thee_mastergen: even though we are on the live patch LCS has yet to show any innovation and still shows little to no growth when it comes to drafts still seeming to follow LPL and LCK in their drafts NACL has more entertainment value being on live patch than the seniors on LCS main stage and the reason why some of the teams that ranked higher in preseason are at the bottom because they can't innovate and as someone said the frauds who copy homework are now being shown up
[1:04:06] Spawnthecaster: useless tbh
[1:04:14] numiiigoesrawrz: lol spawn
[1:04:15] enshero: I just wanna be between spooks and Joseph
[1:04:16] travisgafford: @thee_mastergen feel free to call in
[1:04:25] yanya7701: if anything NA is overvaluing coaches, they dont even have tryouts for coaches which LPL and LCK do
[1:04:27] BalloonHorses: @travisgafford profile says 1002 subs
[1:04:34] thee_mastergen: @travisgafford in the waiting room
[1:04:54] urgotabekidding: @thee_mastergen I agree.  We never seem to see innovation in LCS until week 2 of the patch after other regions have experimented so we can copy.
[1:05:00] scrapabidoopimpaff: @thee_mastergen you should call live w that take
[1:05:45] thee_mastergen: @scrapabidoopimpaff im waiting

[1:07:32] BalloonHorses: Jamaica queens new york?
[1:07:37] BluCrayons: Is the c word still banned
[1:07:43] trespasur: yep
[1:07:47] Revenge: goldenglue coach GAP
[1:07:48] BluCrayons: :(
[1:07:54] MomoMyoi: @razlol raz who is your favorite player on 100T now and then of all time
[1:07:57] timd6210: wagwan mi brethren
[1:07:59] goldenglue: chest gap @Revenge
[1:08:08] ThexCatmanx: So Sion mid didnt happen?
[1:08:09] Ikancast: yep LCK and LEC still seem to be leading innovation, guess live patch isnt enough
[1:08:09] Spawnthecaster: yeah especially the seraphine draft
[1:08:10] Lukecreator4: ehhhh idk i think there have been some cool picks from the younger teams
[1:08:12] ThexCatmanx: Keepo
[1:08:12] Spawnthecaster: that was straight out of lck
[1:08:19] Spawnthecaster: xDd
[1:08:28] timd6210: did piglet pick rammus on purpose?
[1:08:36] urgotabekidding: LEC was playing seraphine double support item the week prior to LCS tho
[1:08:39] numiiigoesrawrz: take: even tho LCS on live patch, there is no real innovation from LCS teams.
[1:08:39] razlol: @razlol river and closer
[1:08:45] sweh_t_balls: aye im listening from bahamas shout out carib fam
[1:08:56] goodguytim18: I thought half of this take was that NACL sees more innovation with fearless draft tbh
[1:08:59] Spawnthecaster: riven seraphine? Asol
[1:09:01] Spawnthecaster: cmon man
[1:09:03] Spawnthecaster: we playing new shit
[1:09:04] MomoMyoi: @razlol good picks
[1:09:13] razlol: also pretty sure there's more innovation in lcs than any other season
[1:09:14] BalloonHorses: LCS is slacking on innovating taric
[1:09:17] razlol: we just have like 10 games
[1:09:18] Ikancast: first to smolder when no one else could pick it, but LEC beat us to AD TF

[1:09:26] littleindianman12: sion vayne?
[1:09:29] thoughtfulcoconut: ezreal support or nothing
[1:09:33] BalloonHorses: Like yeah there are a lot of anti-taric angles but if you squint a little, every draft is a taric angle
[1:09:33] razlol: comparing lcs to nacl or lpl that have 1000000 games is really dumb imo
[1:09:33] urgotabekidding: we were giga late on TF
[1:09:36] mybeautifulbanana: mybeautifulbanana subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:09:36] littleindianman12: aatrox mid
[1:09:36] trespasur: imagine if we had more games 👀
[1:09:40] nfcpm: there is def a different meta in different regions, like udyr never is played in lec
[1:09:40] timothyalex: first few weeks were slow because LCS started later than most regions, but picked up the last couple of weeks
[1:10:08] razlol: riven, tf adc, asol, morde, garen, zac, sion mid ect
[1:10:12] Hack377: @razlol True, how much are you going to risk when losing a single game here costs a lot more than in other regions due to game amounts
[1:10:20] trespasur: smolder
[1:10:25] Maokwa: LCS is also slow at picking stuff up like the Zac and Hwei
[1:10:34] razlol: I'd be interested in an 'innovation per game' stat because we've had the most innovation with NEARLY ANY GAMES
[1:10:38] razlol: so I hard disagree
[1:10:46] urgotabekidding: @Maokwa technically LCS played zac first I think with insanity mid, we were late on zac top tho
[1:10:52] the1andonlycorbin: Not as much as it could
[1:10:58] BalloonHorses: i feel like "innovation" entails so-called off-meta picks
[1:11:00] Noreason_4: sorry but what korean team is going to watch NA for innovations when theyre the best region
[1:11:05] Ikancast: @Maokwa the zac mid from insanity was one of the ones i think we were faster on tbf

[1:11:08] rudetortoise: TF adc lol
[1:11:09] razlol: @the1andonlycorbin but we're currently comparing to other regions
[1:11:12] nfcpm: also i think LCS had a good amount of brand ahead of others
[1:11:18] razlol: @rudetortoise yea it was ass, but thats innovation
[1:11:25] goodguytim18: Yessir this is what I was waiting for
[1:11:28] goodguytim18: best part of this take
[1:11:30] gaidentv: gaidentv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[1:11:39] Ikancast: @rudetortoise as ADC you can say, but brokenblade played TF top before that game
[1:11:45] rudetortoise: trueeeee....but why not mid or top where it's much better
[1:12:10] nfcpm: fun? sion mid is just standing there
[1:12:12] Chia_Ba: @rudetortoise they were trying to checkmate draft i assume
[1:12:16] Ikancast: we need the days of keane hecarim and jarvan
[1:12:17] urgotabekidding: @Ikancast yeah and it was AD TF top so I don't really think TF ADC is really that 'unique"
[1:12:18] BalloonHorses: yeah i think this is more about wanting to see more off meta picks than anything lol
[1:12:20] Maokwa: @ikancast lck already played zac, top mind you, is still playing it mid once innovating if after its only played top.. Like its been in lck ?
[1:12:22] trespasur: and they vayne to counter it
[1:12:27] Lukecreator4: LCK also plays wayyyyy more games so you have more opportunities to see weird picks
[1:12:30] Revenge: @razlol :pig:
[1:12:33] Ikancast: @Maokwa ah thats fair i didnt catch it in LCK then
[1:12:38] razlol: 36 lcs games, 109 lpl games, 91 lck games
[1:12:41] Revenge: OhMyDog
[1:12:52] razlol: @Revenge  🐖
[1:12:59] Lukecreator4: @razlol ty
[1:13:09] MomoMyoi: revenge have u considered other careers in public health or just dr.
[1:13:14] the1andonlycorbin: I think there are a few teams and players being more innovative but the rest of the league seems like they are playing comfort
[1:13:15] Maokwa: @razlol blame mark sotlMarkz sotlMarkzz
[1:13:25] BalloonHorses: i was just really happy when c9 finally went off lucian milio
[1:13:26] BalloonHorses: LOL
[1:13:33] razlol: BINGO
[1:13:33] Hack377: So maybe a lot more new picks with these 2 weeks to try things out?
[1:13:38] BalloonHorses: but now they're just perma picking bard
[1:13:50] kerokerogrips: way fewwer games than major regions , just like how Travis likes it
[1:13:54] nfcpm: that zac mid was crazy
[1:14:04] razlol: ty junglejuice
[1:14:05] shinwinter: @kerokerogrips sktt1fZ sktt1fZ sktt1fZ sktt1fZ sktt1fZ sktt1fZ
[1:14:08] travisgafford: @kerokerogrips stick around after the show, gonna debut a video about this
[1:14:10] gerhardtx: i feel like this split has had more spicy picks than previous lol
[1:14:20] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips dope , excited to see it mate !
[1:14:22] peepeedoc: if you aren't playing teemo top, you aren't innovating
[1:14:29] peepeedoc: need more teemo and shaco
[1:14:34] Prophet181: i want to see azir bot
[1:14:40] mikejanderson: how come picking up smoulder seems so seamless though? is it just because he is that op that people can pick him up on not a lot of practise?
[1:14:49] shinwinter: @Prophet181 tell that to busio
[1:15:02] Ikancast: if we are only trying to win in a small set of methods is that league even worth watching though? i can tune in to T1 and have a high chance Keria is going to pull out something fun
[1:15:10] urgotabekidding: @mikejanderson kinda becomes insta win at stacks and LCS pros are good at doing things like getting stacks
[1:15:15] Maokwa: If only flyquest played pyke bot @papasmithy
[1:15:16] BalloonHorses: So basically c9 perma picking bard for vulcan
[1:15:21] yanya7701: Mark would never change anything, all he does is doing PR videos and tweets which he thinks hes good at as a content creator. Hes basically turned the job of commissioner into a content creator lol
[1:15:27] ZoroHero: win what? lcs? I know orgs care but I think fans in general don’t anymore. we want to lead for once at Internarional
[1:15:47] numiiigoesrawrz: @Maokwa you missed the FLY showmatch ssh
[1:16:06] shinwinter: insanity Based
[1:16:08] ZoroHero: like I don’t care, who wins LCS now to be honest. Who’s going to be innovative and fun enough to watch go international pull something new out and win
[1:16:09] Maokwa: @numiiigoesrawrz i didnt, it just didnt matter which is pointless
[1:16:21] travisgafford: @yanya7701 live patch is literally Mark
[1:16:22] BeepImaJeep2015: LUL forgot the name of the team you are about to flame
[1:16:22] travisgafford: lol
[1:16:29] rudetortoise: i miss licorice yone top
[1:16:34] razlol: 36 lcs games, 109 lpl games. LPL has 83 contested champion picks, LCS has 78 contested picks. 4 PICK DIFFERENCE WITH 70~ MORE GAMES
[1:16:39] MomoMyoi: callers have been so wholesome today
[1:16:47] the1andonlycorbin: Mostly I've been mad that C9's drafts have been so lackluster
[1:16:49] Hammersmith__: Hammersmith__ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:16:53] razlol: im gonna stop yapping now
[1:16:53] Hack377: With Insanity saying he didn't like being labeled as a crazy champ picker do you think that is a reason some pros won't show new picks on stage?
[1:17:04] ThexCatmanx: @razlol No keep yapping
[1:17:06] jarryd999: Well put!
[1:17:09] Maokwa: @zorohero and nobody cares that you dont cares. Its fine for team and fan to focus on their own league first and foremost.
[1:17:12] Cubbyxx: For me innovating implies other folks copy/paste it elsewhere
[1:17:13] scrapabidoopimpaff: @razlol thx for the stats
[1:17:18] VinheGG: @razlol this is a interesting take
[1:17:20] Revenge: @razlol raz has phd in yapping
[1:17:25] Ikancast: i want camille support
[1:17:27] Krepo: Can we get goldenglue a jersey
[1:17:30] Cubbyxx: Think new stuff has been played and tried but I don't see it being adapted or changing how the game is played
[1:17:33] Krepo: man looks cold
[1:17:35] yanya7701: @travisgafford Oh come on even you can do that with a snap of finger. And its not rly that it makes LCS better or better to watch
[1:17:36] Cubbyxx: Globally or elsewhere
[1:17:38] razlol: @Revenge ironiccccccc
[1:17:46] goodguytim18: @razlol Any idea what that number is for NACL?
[1:17:47] ThexCatmanx: 100T needs to make a sleevless jersey
[1:17:54] NStoerz: NStoerz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Thanks for having 100T on!
[1:17:55] MomoMyoi: @Revenge do u want an MD or PhD
[1:17:57] aVarious: I disagree. we need to team fight better. we will never win if we cannot teamfiggt
[1:17:58] Maokwa: @cubbyxx I agree, thats why its hard to call sion and zac mid inovation when no else else picked it up
[1:18:08] travisgafford: @yanya7701 moving the goal post. You said Mark only does content creator stuff, but he literally changed the league to do something no other league has done in 10 years
[1:18:09] ZoroHero: it is true remember that C1 team that couldn’t play anything but innovated the first three wins until they caught on and couldn’t do anything else at world? Siege the tower comp and don’t fight game.
[1:18:20] travisgafford: @yanya7701 feel free to call in, happy to chat with you about this
[1:18:41] jacket__slow: @travisgafford there are only 2 ways that the LCS (who is already behind) can sustainably afford the luxury of innovation is: 1. if a player does it on their own time or 2. if a team invests in an "innovation department" LUL
[1:18:55] aVarious: Yessir. NRG last year is a good example
[1:19:03] ThexCatmanx: Chats fiesty today
[1:19:07] OG_Plumwick: fairweather fan
[1:19:07] bizdgil: GoldenSWOLE
[1:19:10] goodguytim18: @travisgafford agreed
[1:19:14] jesustakethewheels: there are a lot of guests it is a bit chaotic
[1:19:15] razlol: <3 jamaica
[1:19:26] captaintn1: spring finals in Jamaica modcheck
[1:19:29] yanya7701: @travisgafford which is trivial and does not change anything. And exactly as I said, its the sort of PR stuff that you put in a video to brag about but is useless in fact
[1:19:32] wexsyn: I know G2 is an example of a team that leans on flex picks to get advantage out off draft
[1:19:45] Spawnthecaster: raz call in and ask about nunu Vladimir drafts.

[1:22:49] ixbx: @Ikancast yeah love watching BB run him over was a blast
[1:22:49] numiiigoesrawrz: take: 100T thoughts on sniper and his champ pool? strength or weakness?
[1:22:52] yanya7701: hes OK, but not proven yet without enough games played
[1:22:52] lazink: it was just bwipo who said that
[1:22:55] ThexCatmanx: @Ikancast Myrwn is HIM
[1:23:00] dropsofliquid: @BalloonAnimalsandHorses me in every chatroom as a child
[1:23:05] Maokwa: @mikedanewb baffling that anybody still listen to that drama magnet lol
[1:23:08] Ikancast: @ixbx the yasuo game though
[1:23:09] BalloonHorses: @BalloonAnimalsandHorses lollll
[1:23:16] ixbx: @Ikancast true he did well there for sure
[1:23:29] yanya7701: hes like YSKM, and can also go into the exact direction of YSKM
[1:23:36] drbro1228: other top laners are jealous
[1:23:45] trespasur: LOL
[1:23:52] poe_viewer: YSKM is the best pro name i've ever seen
[1:24:14] Lukecreator4: his two most played champs are three of the most popular LCS top laners...
[1:24:20] dropsofliquid: Did you guys get him a jersey that fits for 100T media day tho
[1:24:26] yanya7701: @baxeson too bad hes not good enough to back up that name
[1:24:47] kud0slol: Some ppl been playing lcs while snipers in elementary school just stings the ego if u lose to him
[1:25:02] ThexCatmanx: Sniper said on his stream he perma runs it down in scrims so maybe thats why some say that lol
[1:25:02] Spawnthecaster: quid should be mvp thats my take
[1:25:14] ThexCatmanx: @Spawnthecaster based and true
[1:25:19] PapaSmithy: @Spawnthecaster i think he's frontrunning rn
[1:25:22] PapaSmithy: but 5 games to go
[1:25:29] Maokwa: @kud0slol sniper being 7 or 8 years old when impact won world lol
[1:25:42] Obsirver: @Spawnthecaster No flyquest player?
[1:25:47] ixbx: @Spawnthecaster idk i hear so much of Quid is only looking decent casue River exists so I gotta vote for River
[1:25:51] Lukecreator4: Aatrox has felt like the most skill dependent top laner this split
[1:25:51] nfcpm: to be fair, if they think he can only play Atrox, they can ban him
[1:25:54] Revenge: i dont think most people would have thought sniper could pull of ksante, but he did so that should be a rly good sign
[1:26:00] Revenge: for future metas
[1:26:11] trespasur: good call out
[1:26:33] MomoMyoi: "hes growing everywhere" AYO?
[1:26:38] Maokwa: @revenge but bwipo said sniper doesnt even know how to play him LUL

[1:26:51] Lukecreator4: his ksante has been very solid
[1:27:20] pizzachanlol: @travisgafford did you see the MTG controversy on twitter? Whats your opinion on it
[1:27:27] travisgafford: @pizzachanlol ?

[1:38:19] urgotabekidding: My take: LCS is an entertainment product and watching the 900th game of corki azir isn't "entertaining". LCS should do a modified fearless where the two highest presence champs from each role are not available the following weekend.

[2:13:58] PapaSmithy: LowBudgetLCS lived long enough to see himself become the LCS
[2:13:59] thee_mastergen: I forgot to ask what do teams without an academy team do are there like subs they have not announced or there are no subs
[2:14:00] PapaSmithy: you love to see it
[2:14:17] numiiigoesrawrz: take: for 100T coaches, who are the most formidable opponents for the rest of the split?
[2:14:26] THEcodybauman: @ixbx Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:14:32] Badvertisement: @urgotabekidding i think when connected to windows they sound especially bad? i dont think they sound that bad connected to iphones
[2:14:37] MattScoot2: @goldenglue big shout out to quid and busio, some of the most consistent pros at streaming. definitely think its important for the scene as a whole for pros to consistently stream
[2:14:40] Badvertisement: not 100% tho
[2:14:41] yanya7701: yeah closely bad
[2:15:00] OhHaiVegA: @PapaSmithy its important to have goals :)
[2:15:03] Maokwa: @yanya7701 you shouls call in about that take SeemsGood
[2:15:08] LowBudgetLCS: @PapaSmithy Hahaha you can't fight destiny
[2:15:12] Deuxblem: i still think c9 will sucks
[2:15:13] nfcpm: or TL
[2:15:15] Ikancast: flyquestFQcheer
[2:15:25] urgotabekidding: IMT is good but make throw plays and toss games
[2:15:55] yanya7701: they have a KR top and mid coming fresh off KR, ofc they would seem strong at the start
[2:16:24] trespasur: sion mid is bussin
[2:16:31] scaf6: @yanya7701 What an interesting take. You should call in
[2:16:39] urgotabekidding: Careful 100T, there's a chance you could be rank 1 by the time you play SR...they gunnin for them #1s
[2:16:48] Maokwa: @scaf6 LUL
[2:17:05] razlol: also SR got wins off teams fucking up dives bot
[2:17:15] razlol: not really something they can control
[2:17:25] urgotabekidding: Insanity talked about it on Pros. He picks champs he feels are strong for the draft not picks for the sake of 'whacky picks' and he doesn't really like that perception
[2:17:54] ixbx: as long as ya keep River off of J4, EZ dubs
[2:18:03] Maokwa: @razlol if you're an actual good team shouldnt you be able to recover from one bad dive ?
[2:18:22] yanya7701: again, how good an NA team will never be how good the imports on those teams are, it will always come down how good the non-import slot filling players are because the quality of the imports you can get will always be kinda similar bc no one rly wants to go to NA
[2:18:24] timd6210: 100t and fly at finals
[2:18:40] scaf6: @yanya7701 Good take. Call in with that
[2:18:42] nfcpm: jojo is inting too much
[2:18:42] nerfcapitalism: everyone’s super strong huh
[2:18:46] Maokwa: @yanya7701 so much typing when you could just call in !
[2:19:02] Niting97: @yanya7701 have you tried calling into a call in show?
[2:19:05] leagueofemily: when will we see River Talon again? :3
[2:19:06] urgotabekidding: bweeepo
[2:19:13] bussy_bopper: love me some bweepo
[2:19:15] razlol: @Maokwa NRG's comp was off of bot, and they died, lost sums and SR is not bad enough to completely give up that lead. vs C9 I think was hard to stabilize off that too
[2:19:21] steph_curry_no1_fan: c9 missing playoffs 🙏🙏
[2:19:23] blyve: when will we see C9 Licorice? fudge is washed
[2:19:28] BeepImaJeep2015: Bah weeeee po
[2:19:36] jacket__slow: wideBweepo
[2:19:57] the1andonlycorbin: I'd like to see Licorice as C9 coach
[2:20:04] Ikancast: bvoy looks good though
[2:20:06] MikeDaNewb: i'd put the house on c9 not missing playoffs lol
[2:20:09] jacket__slow: wait, hands are required?
[2:20:10] nfcpm: i think jensen is solid in any meta
[2:20:14] urgotabekidding: Bvoy probably best ADC in the league IMO
[2:20:16] trespasur: id like to see svenskeren and darshan as c9 coaches
[2:20:34] littleindianman12: @MikeDaNewb they literally need two more wins to gurantee playoffs huh?
[2:20:35] poe_viewer: @the1andonlycorbin forget about coach, bro should be playing for them instead of sludge LUL
[2:20:38] blyve: I'd like to see LS as C9 Coach Kappa
[2:20:39] 100tjunglejuice: yes bvoy does look very good probably the highlight of the roster currently.
[2:20:45] 1DeepBlue: @numiiigoesrawrz would it be BM to gift subs to Travis because i'm not spending money on Alienware anymore?
[2:20:52] littleindianman12: @MikeDaNewb I am willing to bet 100 bucks if you are down
[2:20:59] ProteusWest: legend
[2:21:00] urgotabekidding: urology joke FTW
[2:21:01] itsDiscoCisco: hell yeah that dude was dope
[2:21:02] Maokwa: @razlol I agree nrg comp was rough, but c9 just dying back to back bot was just so bad and odd from a suposed good team
[2:21:09] numiiigoesrawrz: @1DeepBlue if you would like to gift subs you can ! it helps travis

[2:22:32] ur_a_rock: how did people even get tickets??? they insta sold out lmao
[2:22:36] steph_curry_no1_fan: flyquest vs TL finals
[2:22:37] urgotabekidding: This is Jack with a voice changer trying to get free advice for fixing his team
[2:22:42] Cubbyxx: @nfcpm This hit home...
[2:22:44] numiiigoesrawrz: take: what changes should c9 make if they don't make MSI? zven is a free agent, which teams should sign him?
[2:22:49] goldenglue: @urgotabekidding LMAO
[2:22:56] razlol: remember Unforgiven is also a free agent!
[2:22:58] PapaSmithy: give them the free consulting joe
[2:23:02] Maokwa: @ur_a_rock ask @numiiigoesrawrz she loves the ticketing Kappa
[2:23:05] blyve: drop fudge
[2:23:12] bussy_bopper: zven vulcan again?
[2:23:22] BeepImaJeep2015: TL can benefit for LS bootcamp. He'd make APA learn how to play Annie and Ivern within a week.
[2:23:23] yanya7701: I mean they only changed their roster so you can def point the fingers lmao
[2:23:24] numiiigoesrawrz: there was a second round of ticketing earlier today 🤷‍♂️
[2:23:30] ur_a_rock: @Maokwa Will Do Buckaroo Kappa
[2:23:43] peepeedoc: Xeri + Wukong buffs will help C9 as much if not more than any other team
[2:24:08] the1andonlycorbin: Mithy said in a recent interview that they are trying out a new drafting strategy. It's possible that this has been hurting them.
[2:24:11] urgotabekidding: It seems like the general consensus from insiders is that C9 needs to add coaches more than anything else
[2:24:16] sw1tchbox: ls said that
[2:24:20] razlol: bwipo did
[2:24:25] scrapabidoopimpaff: bussio on  the lcs podcast
[2:24:25] hunterwinger: I think that was Bwipo on Pros. Thats whwere I heard it
[2:24:26] OUTLANDERau: Bwipo on PROs said that @travisgafford
[2:24:31] PapaSmithy: i believe spookz said that originally
[2:24:31] nfcpm: but zven is an adc now right?
[2:24:34] scrapabidoopimpaff: Bwipo******
[2:24:35] sw1tchbox: @razlol i think both have actually
[2:24:35] bussy_bopper: ya it was bwipo
[2:24:37] ixbx: @the1andonlycorbin yeah like not knowing his mid laners champion pool KEKW
[2:24:43] thoughtfulcoconut: he's open to adc/support i think
[2:24:45] Ikancast: he has a lot of personality too which is nice. his streams are fun to watch
[2:24:45] urgotabekidding: Any team that picks up Zven gets a GIGANTIC content boost. Dude is a content genius
[2:24:56] yanya7701: he meant support
[2:24:58] littleindianman12: TL can get rid of yeon
[2:25:00] sw1tchbox: zven>tactial
[2:25:03] Andyyybarton: it would be insightful tho
[2:25:05] blyve: immortals or dig?

[2:25:15] urgotabekidding: LUUUUL travis
[2:25:21] bussy_bopper: good shot
[2:25:22] BeepImaJeep2015: LUL
[2:25:24] itsDiscoCisco: LUL
[2:25:24] OG_Plumwick: yeah uh...
[2:25:25] kerokerogrips: KEKW
[2:25:31] Fudgenator: LUK
[2:25:33] Fudgenator: LUL
[2:25:37] yanya7701: I dont think you would want him as adc when he stopped playing for like 2 yrs...
[2:25:38] ur_a_rock: *please clap* vibes
[2:25:45] Niting97: damn travis got cooked real time
[2:25:45] nfcpm: maybe zven should go to LEC
[2:25:49] razlol: add 2 more teams, there's a lot of talent available right now :)
[2:25:54] the1andonlycorbin: Zven streamed last week, it was a fun stream
[2:26:07] spookz2: raz you make a team
[2:26:10] bussy_bopper: what coaching staff
[2:26:12] spookz2: take matters in your own hands
[2:26:12] Prophet181: Zven has been streaming like every day
[2:26:18] razlol: @spookz2 what should i call it
[2:26:19] blyve: i could see zven on Team liquid
[2:26:22] lilelf29: @the1andonlycorbin He's been streaming every day
[2:26:24] razlol: Chiefs Rowing Club
[2:26:31] spookz2: razmos plams
[2:26:32] thoughtfulcoconut: He'd be an instant upgrade for some LEC orgs. KC, Rogue, maybe TH
[2:26:34] spookz2: plasms*
[2:26:45] BeepImaJeep2015: Jojo should be replaced if C9 fails, simply because of his rumored contract.
[2:26:46] razlol: writing it down for a new llc
[2:26:50] spookz2: Chiefs Rowing Club rip
[2:27:04] Nazhjin: hai is a sub spot fill
[2:27:06] Ikancast: that would be interesting and C9 has brought in other player coaches before in armao and zeyzal
[2:27:09] spiffco: zven as positional coach?
[2:27:09] bussy_bopper: didnt they slash their coaching staff
[2:27:09] yanya7701: @thoughtfulcoconut you mean as support?
[2:27:18] thoughtfulcoconut: @yanya7701 no as adc
[2:27:20] Nazhjin: c9 required to have sub, hai fills that
[2:27:29] xadamxk: Where tf is Nathan
[2:27:31] yanya7701: @thoughtfulcoconut adc hes def better than those ones
[2:27:37] the1andonlycorbin: @lilelf29 ohh, cool, I only saw him once and it seemed like his first stream
[2:27:44] yanya7701: @thoughtfulcoconut *not better
[2:28:16] meloview: add coaches!? wtf 😂
[2:28:16] peepeedoc: just need more time to develop the hive mind
[2:28:24] urgotabekidding: Zven and Mithy fights again :D
[2:28:39] meloview: OVER indexing on regular split.
[2:28:39] thoughtfulcoconut: @yanya7701 he's better than comp, flakked, upset. I'd even argue he's better than Supa
[2:28:58] scrapabidoopimpaff: Berseker needs to wake up, and either force vulcan to go full enchanter supp for berseker or unleash him and put him back into roam/engage support.
[2:29:01] meloview: c9 will still make finals, 100t most likely slumps out of playoffs early. regular split doesn’t say much
[2:29:05] ixbx: @thoughtfulcoconut put Supa on there but not Ice, sus list
[2:29:05] blyve: Why are they dodging talking about fudge? Susge
[2:29:16] yanya7701: @thoughtfulcoconut how? He hasnt been playing for 2 yrs
[2:29:20] thoughtfulcoconut: Ice is really good imo
[2:29:26] urgotabekidding: fudge not even close to the weak point for c9 this split
[2:29:58] Ikancast: you need a mourinho mindset
[2:30:02] ProteusWest: C9 doesn't have a really defined weak point right now, they're just struggling to play together
[2:30:11] peepeedoc: ^^
[2:30:25] meloview: like England with lampard and Gerrard
[2:30:30] trespasur: @urgotabekidding i dont think fudge has generated a lead on his own this split
[2:30:42] SunnyDavidRS: League esports is all about summer/worlds season anyways
[2:30:52] nfcpm: they are also struggling to exploit their comps. like not being able to win with lucian but keep picking him
[2:30:58] ProteusWest: Fudge won a player of the game this split
[2:30:59] thoughtfulcoconut: I think their issue has been what their issue has been historically. drafting hands diff comps they dont actually have the macro to execute with

[2:31:28] the1andonlycorbin: they have to make it first
[2:31:41] gurg7: whoopl2Hmmm
[2:31:44] SunnyDavidRS: @yanya7701 HAHAHAHAHAHA don't disrespect the scrim world champions
[2:31:49] peepeedoc: whats the avengers endgame dr strange meme? one world...
[2:31:50] Avvura: scripted?
[2:31:51] goldenglue: @gurg7 LOL
[2:32:11] urgotabekidding: @trespasur fudge is mid to top in laning stats this split. I can't speak to "on his own" but he's gotten way less jungle presence this split than last split
[2:32:19] yanya7701: @SunnyDavidRS I mean at least they won one
[2:32:21] Prophet181: exposed at last
[2:32:28] littleindianman12: @thoughtfulcoconut my dude they hands diff draft is a dumb excuse. They pick winning lanes predicated on winning lane = hands diff, late game team fighting comp draft = hands diff.
[2:32:38] nfcpm: they had to go from Kraft Mac & Cheese to store brand.
[2:33:03] the1andonlycorbin: Mithy basically said that in a recent interview. They have to pay players and have to cut in other areas.

[2:34:12] Jeankof: fearx too
[2:34:13] ixbx: he did until LCK came in with offers
[2:34:14] lilelf29: LSB (FearX) wanted him too
[2:34:22] hide_on_her_bush: He had an lck offer @travisgafford

[2:34:53] urgotabekidding: @blyve not this split
[2:34:59] DoubleUone: 1 Jojo so low supply
[2:35:03] bussy_bopper: and yet tthey got jensen
[2:35:04] PapaSmithy: we were priced out of jojo
[2:35:13] PapaSmithy: good player tho
[2:35:39] nfcpm: @PapaSmithy I'm glad you ended up with Jensen instead
[2:35:41] yanya7701: @PapaSmithy good for you
[2:35:48] hide_on_her_bush: Jojo said if not c9 he would've accepted Lck

[2:38:48] blyve: @ProteusWest yup
[2:38:53] Andyyybarton: they can be pretty misleading

[2:51:59] nfcpm: i hated duel stream
[2:52:06] karlheinzstockfootage: the very fact two teams bailed makes b03 fine
[2:52:24] yanya7701: but dont you only have 8 teams now?
[2:52:26] lilelf29: Dual stream times LUL
[2:52:33] travisgafford: I address that
[2:52:45] scrapabidoopimpaff: omg young kobe
[2:53:00] dropsofliquid: When is this video
[2:53:16] ProteusWest: 2018
[2:53:16] shinwinter: @dropsofliquid 7 years ago right?
[2:53:24] shinwinter: 6 then
[2:53:24] dropsofliquid: no clue
[2:53:27] isaiah_aw: TSM in 2024 LUL
[2:53:38] karlheinzstockfootage: 2 best of 3's (4 teams) saturday, same thing sunday.    holding out against b03's at the point is stupid
[2:53:40] ProteusWest: because they went back to best of 1 after 2017
[2:53:46] iBlazze: what happened to those two rioters that used to talk about the league when franchising first started lol
[2:53:53] dropsofliquid: I started watching in 2017 so makes sense 😂
[2:53:54] yanya7701: what...
[2:54:00] jacket__slow: the good ol' days when riot people weren't corporate drones peepoHappy
[2:54:17] HzHammy: have they ever talked about doing similar schedule to lck
[2:54:27] karlheinzstockfootage: it is an 8 team league.  and no teams learn to adjust
[2:54:31] dropsofliquid: Most of those fans probably aren’t around though doesnt league have decent fan turnover?
[2:54:48] peepeedoc: how about collated Bo3s? that way you could get all game 1s of a series in a row for those who want some team diversity but then still play the G2s and G3s if necessary after?
[2:54:49] shinwinter: hey 6 year info is updated enough
[2:54:53] ixbx: turnover no, fall off yes @dropsofliquid
[2:54:57] jdc009: best of 1s are fine
[2:55:07] goblilno: 6 years is a longtime
[2:55:10] enshero: Bo2
[2:55:11] isaiah_aw: jesus travis, that camera is premium.
[2:55:30] Rum_in_a_Bottle: As someone that just tunes in for 1 game a weekend, a bo3 outside playoffs isn't really appealing to me. Is it better for the teams tho? Probably
[2:55:42] yanya7701: duel stream is bad
[2:55:50] yanya7701: but best of 3 is not
[2:55:59] IAmMurdr: lcs redzone :P
[2:56:02] dropsofliquid: Monday through Thursday baby
[2:56:13] goblilno: does travis look at any other regions?
[2:56:16] womboboys: Having asymmetric league formats is hokey. Fake sports flag.
[2:56:29] Maokwa: @rum_in_a_bottle no its not.
[2:56:29] dropsofliquid: The viewership hasn’t changed much from weekdays though right?
[2:56:34] ProteusWest: right now, they have a tight 3 or so hours if you don't watch pregame, that's actually somewhat valuable
[2:56:36] GTurtle99: Fri-Mon
[2:56:41] rvollert: Best of 2 is far better than best of 3
[2:56:42] yanya7701: @dropsofliquid exactly lol
[2:56:56] peepeedoc: triple Bo1 round robin
[2:57:01] peepeedoc: instead of double
[2:57:03] shewasabulldozer: nobody talking about the best of 5 regular season potential
[2:57:09] shewasabulldozer: best of 5 triple round robin
[2:57:11] MestasGames: travis, with 8 teams dont you lose a number of games? what about bo3 single round robin like vct?
[2:57:11] ProteusWest: if I want to watch the entire LCS, then it's not maniacal to do it
[2:57:14] dropsofliquid: bo7
[2:57:16] yanya7701: @dropsofliquid they just will never admit that NA's international results is what drove the viewership down
[2:57:16] nfcpm: then some teams dont play each week

[2:57:21] MacDaAce: you gotta spend money to make money baby
[2:57:22] jdc009: instead of 2 bo1 then just 1 bo3 for the entire split and 3 splits? idk
[2:57:22] rvollert: Should just do bo1 but more weeks
[2:57:25] nfcpm: so your team might not play for weeks
[2:57:42] the1andonlycorbin: I like Bo1s, but Bo2s would be interesting with the shorter wait between games
[2:57:54] Maokwa: @yanya7701 just like youll never admit that you're completly clueless
[2:57:55] karlheinzstockfootage: man travis, the lcs and markz commisionership are gonna die on this hill
[2:57:56] dropsofliquid: @the1andonlycorbin same
[2:58:01] womboboys: Delete EU and NA and combine them into a Super Suck League
[2:58:11] SunnyDavidRS: @womboboys hahahahaahahaha
[2:58:17] karlheinzstockfootage: @womboboys not wrong
[2:58:24] dropsofliquid: I might prefer one bo3 a week
[2:58:28] Rum_in_a_Bottle: Adapt LEC schedule and add a whole split
[2:58:35] yanya7701: @Maokwa saying someone is clueless doesnt make you not clueless lol
[2:58:35] dropsofliquid: It would be one less day to watch
[2:58:43] Maokwa: @dropsofliquid you're in minority
[2:58:55] shinwinter: yeah LCS us just entertainnign region so deal with it
[2:58:58] karlheinzstockfootage: it's not a ten team league
[2:59:00] dropsofliquid: @maokwa based on what data 😂
[2:59:07] ProteusWest: people who watch HLL live and are watching this are in the minority
[2:59:11] enshero: Bo2 dbl round robin..blue n red side
[2:59:16] travisgafford: @dalimccubist I wish you would have watched the video instead of arguing in the chat, because I literally addressed this
[2:59:19] ProteusWest: as opposed to casual viewers
[2:59:22] karlheinzstockfootage: it's 8. so easily doable on the weekend cause 2-0s
[2:59:25] xadamxk: @travisgafford I've liked your openings and Mr Beast parody... hope to see more creativity in videos
[2:59:38] TheBrutalBeans: what a scam

[2:59:40] yanya7701: @dropsofliquid dont bother with that guy, all he got is called ppl names like "you are clueless""you are in minority"
[2:59:44] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford i apologized tuned in late
[2:59:49] isaiah_aw: Lmfao

[3:00:03] HzHammy: I would 100% buy whatever shit you cookin in an alley
[3:00:03] Niting97: make it bo5, that'll fix it
[3:00:03] nfcpm: @travisgafford i would have liked if you could have suggested some other way to get more games
[3:00:06] MestasGames: sotlHang
[3:00:06] dropsofliquid: bring in the Brazilian teams
[3:00:06] TheBrutalBeans: that was golden
[3:00:07] enshero: Opening n closing OP

[3:00:20] Autoriot: muted
[3:00:22] iBlazze: Americas league is better than bo3s
[3:00:23] jdc009: very immersive video
[3:00:24] goblilno: i like the video
[3:00:25] MacDaAce: LUL pretty solid
[3:00:28] goblilno: some good points
[3:00:29] the1andonlycorbin: sotlClap1 sotlClap2 sotlClap1
[3:00:31] ProteusWest: anything that craps on best of 3 is A+ in my book
[3:00:32] sonofone: Travis how do you keep yourself so effortlessly handsome man
[3:00:34] MestasGames: GIVE US ANOTHER BOUNTY
[3:00:35] dropsofliquid: Good video. I still want bo3 but good content
[3:00:35] sonofone: GG
[3:00:35] SkyeTheX: Why not split orgs into 2 divisions. Have 2 bo3s on Saturday and 2 bo3s on Sunday. And only require teams to play a total of 8 bo3s (play less out of division games) for an 8 week LCS?
[3:00:36] isaiah_aw: @travisgafford How much was the camera you used for that video?
[3:00:38] bii_bella: really love seeing you have more fun with the vids
[3:00:39] karlheinzstockfootage: came in late, came in too hor @travisgafford SORRY
[3:00:41] jarryd999: add in clips of meat
[3:00:44] SunnyDavidRS: MarkZ is doomed lol
[3:00:50] thoughtfulcoconut: why is 2 days of 2 matches of Bo3s a week a bad thing? the lights are only on for 2 days and  you're getting all 8 teams. You can double round robin in a split still and you're not at risk of losing viewers
[3:00:58] yanya7701: Markz will lose job after this year lol
[3:00:58] MacDaAce: is HLL going to have ARG elements now?
[3:01:03] jacket__slow: D:
[3:01:06] jacket__slow: in game right?
[3:01:14] MestasGames: What do you think from looking at vct as a case study for bo3 single round robin
[3:01:16] ProteusWest: a hill is too expensive, we'd die on a mound

[3:01:23] jacket__slow: say in game monkaS
[3:01:36] dropsofliquid: An anthill @proteuswest
[3:01:38] thoughtfulcoconut: You can literally just copy the LCK schedule but axe the games in half
[3:01:45] Maokwa: @yanya7701 you're just so full of bad take as usual and was too of a coward to even call in about any of them lol
[3:02:12] JoGOAT_Bahh: We can't compart ourselves to the Asian leagues.
[3:02:24] kerokerogrips: i like Bo3 , because it reduces variance in team performance, so tired of seeing takes on teams based off 2 games over one weekend  , especially when fluke drafts or plays can ruin one whole game
[3:02:32] DrProfSgtMrJ: tarvis, if they move to best of 3s and it is successful, will you eat a shoe?
[3:02:39] poisonyvie: Missed most of the video, but what about longer days?
[3:02:40] yanya7701: @Maokwa again you are just proving my point "you are this you are that" what takes and points do you have? none, you are just a brainless bozo that have nothing in your head other than calling ppl stuff
[3:02:46] jacket__slow: @Maokwa and they keep going because some people can't help but feed the trolls LUL
[3:02:57] thoughtfulcoconut: you dont need 4 days though. You can do Fri/Sat or Sat/sun. Every team plays 2 Bo3s over the weekend.
[3:03:01] lilelf29: Couldn't we have less weeks off and not finish a full round each week?
[3:03:03] MattScoot2: Give me 2 Bo3 on saturday 2 bo3 on sunday, and remote bo1 on thur fri
[3:03:06] dropsofliquid: That still sounds better to me. I’d watch less for sure but probably would be more sustainable for most fans.
[3:03:12] ProteusWest: if you look at Friday Night League, or Monday Night League, let me ask you if you think that expanding past two days is good
[3:03:28] dropsofliquid: Giving up the middle of both weekends is a tough ask
[3:03:53] MacDaAce: c9
[3:03:53] bondance: Can Travis go back to making a living taking boudoir photos for a living?
[3:03:54] goblilno: SHOPIFY IS FUN TO WATCH
[3:03:59] goblilno: caps*
[3:04:02] DrProfSgtMrJ: what if you only did one best of 5 per team?
[3:04:03] thoughtfulcoconut: I'd argue that the real argument in favor of bo3 isn't more aggregate games, it's better practice for international play with actual drafts and adaptations
[3:04:05] MestasGames: how did it work for vct?
[3:04:09] karlheinzstockfootage: nrg are champs
[3:04:15] nfcpm: @travisgafford so how do you add more games
[3:04:18] womboboys: What if you do best of's over a few days like a Baseball series
[3:04:20] poisonyvie: Upside is I get to watch more of the team I want to watch
[3:04:24] karlheinzstockfootage: c9 lost 5 strainght
[3:04:27] dropsofliquid: @thoughtfulcoconut we usually don’t get past the bo1 portion though
[3:04:33] ixbx: @dalimccubist and still no one cares about them, maybe if they win again.. maybe
[3:04:42] goblilno: , that happends every reagions
[3:04:45] Maokwa: @thoughtfulcoconut NA did best at world while on bo1. Worst on bo3.
[3:04:49] jacket__slow: shopify LUL immortals LUL
[3:05:01] ProteusWest: @womboboys baseball can do that because they play 162 games a year in their regular season and play almost every day
[3:05:14] goblilno: thats a really good point
[3:05:21] dropsofliquid: I don’t watch other regions screw those good at league worlds winning regions. NA forever 😂
[3:05:25] goblilno: diffrent regions diffrent prices
[3:05:26] ProteusWest: people are making some wild comparisons to try to push best of 3's
[3:05:30] karlheinzstockfootage: lck and lpl are every night
[3:05:32] thoughtfulcoconut: @Maokwa that was an entirely different league with entirely different context around it. bo3s saves money, gives a potential for more games, and is better practice for the teams that take their presence in the league seriously
[3:05:34] karlheinzstockfootage: mostly
[3:05:40] itsDiscoCisco: its more anti Bo3 than it is SUPER pro Bo1
[3:05:45] yanya7701: @Maokwa NA did best bc Korea sht their bed that year and the West got lucky
[3:05:51] dropsofliquid: Bo2’s 🙏
[3:05:58] spiffco: as someone else said, what is your take on 2 studio days and 2 remote days?
[3:05:58] Maokwa: Majority of team hated doing 3 days a week last split. And "fan" ask for 4-5 days a week lol
[3:06:04] MestasGames: lets go quad stream and have 4 bo5s at the same time with the fearless rules
[3:06:13] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[3:06:15] peepeedoc: @travisgafford honest question about viewership that I'm not sure how works: how are VODs views factored into "viewership" numbers that people generally talk about? I imagine VOD views go up if Bo3 while live views may decrease some, but maybe total would be similar or slightly up bc of VOD counts?
[3:06:24] jacket__slow: @travisgafford what is your honest opinion on best of 4's? 🤔
[3:06:29] Maokwa: @yanya7701 another bad take SeemsGood
[3:06:30] MattScoot2: 2 days Remote Bo1, 2 days In Person bo3
[3:06:32] Niting97: I agree, bo1 is much better in terms of pure entertainment. Bo3 is NOT the reason we don't perform internationally, wish people would stop parroting that
[3:06:38] dropsofliquid: @maokwa I didn’t like the 3 days a week as a fan either. I kept missing Wednesdays forgetting they existed
[3:06:42] ProteusWest: I think triple round robin isn't terrible now because it'd be 21 games instead of the normal 18
[3:06:49] DrProfSgtMrJ: @travisgafford what if only the top half did best of threes?
[3:06:54] crisafad: Is there a reason they can't just not do a full broadcast of every game?
[3:06:55] thoughtfulcoconut: You cant tell me that bo1 is objectively better practice for international results when the crux of what makes worlds teams good is their ability to play in series
[3:06:56] yanya7701: @Maokwa again calling something a "bad take" doesnt rly make those takes bad lol
[3:07:09] nfcpm: yeah remote sucks
[3:07:11] itsDiscoCisco: yeah dude covid was really rough
[3:07:28] nfcpm: NACL broadcast is not anywhere near as good
[3:07:34] thoughtfulcoconut: Ok but we've learned from the covid broadcasts and had a lot of restrictions during that time too. it's not the same situation now that it was then. Remote is entirely possible
[3:07:43] abovedaocean: isn't it just because everyone was TSM fan and they only tuned in to TSM series bo3's?
[3:07:59] dropsofliquid: Did lock in just die I forgot about that
[3:08:04] karlheinzstockfootage: bo3's will make teams git gud. would c9 lose 5 bo3's in a row?
[3:08:17] ProteusWest: @abovedaocean it's kind of like that now, just with C9
[3:08:23] jdc009: HARD SwiftRage CORE o7
[3:08:26] MestasGames: have you looked into how the bo3 srr format worked for vct?
[3:08:29] dropsofliquid: 11:47 arguing about shady alley deals 😂
[3:08:31] bii_bella: 💅🏼
[3:08:31] itsDiscoCisco: its true, im a league goblin
[3:08:34] MacDaAce: yeah what am I doing with my life ....
[3:08:41] yanya7701: idk your voice is just soothing and puts me to sleep thats the main reason why im here lol
[3:08:41] lilelf29: Travis could it not work out if the LCS took less weeks off and not complete a full round each week instead of increasing the amount of days, as well as maybe an extra super week? Like right now there's a 3 week gap, it would alleviate the time problem quite a lot without that
[3:08:47] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford there is no casual fan left :)
[3:08:47] abovedaocean: yeah maybe lol
[3:08:48] dropsofliquid: Every casual fan I know doesn’t watch anymore tbh
[3:08:49] MattScoot2: @travisgafford thats why i suggest 2 days of remote bo1 and bo3 on weekends. weigh the bo3 higher
[3:09:01] jarryd999: Riot should release League Of Legends 2 where it's basically the same but its 6v6
[3:09:03] ProteusWest: the gap we have now is basically to get the LCS back on weekends
[3:09:08] jarryd999: and they add a few new champs
[3:09:11] Maokwa: @mattscoot2 thats just so bad
[3:09:12] karlheinzstockfootage: bo1s ran off the casual fan

[3:09:25] jdc009: I want a weekly 8 team bo1 tournament bracket with all ro8 and upper bracket 3/4 games on stage, and then a 2nd stream for lower bracket, and then all 8 places give points towards bo5 playoff seeding
[3:09:25] trespasur: is this the video or live?
[3:09:30] IAmMurdr: Stop hitting me with your facts and logic Travis >:T
[3:09:36] dropsofliquid: I just like watching bo3’s more. we’re doomed internationally already
[3:09:39] jarryd999: @trespasur Live
[3:09:39] Maokwa: @mattscoot2 remote play just suck. And team are better scrimming than doing this
[3:09:41] itsDiscoCisco: @MattScoot2 that's literally two formats just blended together. theyre pretty much different games altogether
[3:09:45] wezzeonlol: good morning from Sweden mr. Gafford
[3:09:55] ProteusWest: our competitive results internationally during best of threes were really bad
[3:09:58] MacDaAce: Do you think there is a chance that we actually get 2 more teams?
[3:10:02] MestasGames: 14 games doesnt feel enough I have to say
[3:10:09] nfcpm: they could do 6 games a day. so everyone plays 3 games a weekend.
[3:10:12] goblilno: i really like watching shopify
[3:10:27] yanya7701: @ProteusWest and during bo1 it was so good lmao
[3:10:38] ProteusWest: honestly, I'd like triple round robin with 8 teams, or I'd like to see Valorant style promotion
[3:10:46] Maokwa: 14 games isnt enough. But just "switching to bo3" just isnt it. And most reason for bo3 is just huge copium
[3:10:52] jarryd999: Riot should refund all the franchise fees and go back to promo/demo system
[3:10:53] Jagshockey: NA is doomed until we are viable at worlds. the US is too accustomed to winning leagues and the "average" viewer doesnt want to root for a mid team. thats why cancer teams like the Yankees have so many fans. 27 championships

[3:11:19] karlheinzstockfootage: anyway, you haven't convinced me.  i respect your effort.  riot NA has not grown the audience in 6 years.
[3:11:21] smokepacks: bro i got 0 clue about this scene but youre really passionate about it, love the energy
[3:11:23] ProteusWest: or because they're from New York
[3:11:28] jarryd999: @Jagshockey 100
[3:11:34] bii_bella: as a hardcore casual fan doing live patch is the one thing that has pulled me in more. tbh I could care less if they changed to bo3s, I’d get so tired much faster of seeing the same comps over and over
[3:11:37] ProteusWest: which is super populous
[3:11:41] peepeedoc: if "viewership" numbers don't include VOD views, then unpopular take: they should charge a subscription fee for access to VODs; i would personally watch live more if I knew it would cost me $ to watch VODs instead
[3:11:43] Maokwa: @goblilno Even if SR are really fun to watch, of the viewership # still disagree its still what matter
[3:11:49] IAmMurdr: NA doomed?
[3:11:56] karlheinzstockfootage: riot's data is bad
[3:12:05] trespasur: so how do we fix the problem of we need more games/ like the APA tweet?
[3:12:06] timd6210: @travisgafford What really happen to jatt?>
[3:12:13] dropsofliquid: That was 6 years ago though is that still who watches league?
[3:12:15] goblilno: thats vaild, that audineces are diffrent in diffrent regions, but 6 years alot changes, i didnt play leauge 6 years ago
[3:12:21] Fr0z3nph03n1x: They asked the wrong fans.
[3:12:22] jarryd999: Riot should bring back dominion and make pros play that instead
[3:12:25] ProteusWest: if VOD views cost money, then I probably couldn't follow the League anymore
[3:12:30] goblilno: @Maokwa thats fair, viewship is important
[3:12:34] thoughtfulcoconut: @travisgafford what about 2 days of 2 matches of bo3's a week. Even if both series only go 2 games each, you're getting about 5 hours of content a day, cutting out a whole day of cost for broadcasts, and still seeing all 8 teams
[3:12:37] MacDaAce: it was also data that showed them that weekdays was a good idea LUL
[3:12:38] Maokwa: @jarryd999 you just want lcs to fail at this point for suggesting this lmao
[3:12:42] itsDiscoCisco: LUL
[3:12:48] peepeedoc: then they shouldn't count "viewership" as only live viewers
[3:12:49] ProteusWest: the truth is we all get this for free
[3:12:50] rvollert: While I agree bo3 is a bad idea, Riot also thought going to weekdays at noon was a great idea.
[3:12:56] itsDiscoCisco: i love when chat gets the reality check from papa travis
[3:12:56] dropsofliquid: @macdaace tbf that wasn’t that bad. they might have been right
[3:13:00] peepeedoc: the VOD viewer are still seeing the sponsor shit
[3:13:05] lilelf29: Genuinely how is it possible for them to distinguish that was the specific issue when the variable of dual streams was present the entire time? You can't just ignore variables in you analysis
[3:13:14] MacDaAce: @dropsofliquid true
[3:13:17] MestasGames: zoomers dont have attention span for bo3, lets skip the bo1 games to 15 min to get to the team fights instead
[3:13:20] ProteusWest: the most popular VOD's are third party, I would assume
[3:13:40] jacket__slow: LCK can pull off Bo3 because they're giving more games of ACTUAL quality LUL
[3:13:42] jarryd999: Yea zoomers dont want long games, pro scene plays URF now
[3:13:44] trespasur: @travisgafford I'm just so mad that the guys who ran LCS got promoted when they literally did nothing to help the LCS
[3:13:51] karlheinzstockfootage: riot's data drives down viewership, year-on-year.  in the best of 1 era
[3:13:56] Jagshockey: hardcore fans will appreciate it. isnt that enough?
[3:14:01] Pita26: Do vod numbers count for viewership?
[3:14:02] nfcpm: no
[3:14:05] dropsofliquid: Do people dm you crazy stuff or who says you’re a heretic 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
[3:14:12] iBlazze: @travisgafford how does this sound: Americas league; combine the top teams from NA, CBLOL, LLA as the main league. Then get rid of NACL and make AmericasCL. Where all the remaining teams that didnt get into the main league can compete. And maybe you do a valorant type relegation / promotion.
[3:14:13] peepeedoc: i'd bet that the total of VOD views and live views would not change much between Bo1s and Bo3s, but my go up because VOD views would have better potential to go up with time
[3:14:18] jdc009: bo3 better for hardcore viewer since they like seeing draft changes ... which doesn't matter to a casual fan who doesn't watch the first/second game
[3:14:20] MacDaAce: idk LEC does BO3s right? and NA > EU so why would we stoop down to their level?
[3:14:21] MestasGames: you moved my needle from dont care to dont do bo3
[3:14:22] thoughtfulcoconut: why do we care about data when riot has ignored it every step of the way?
[3:14:24] dropsofliquid: I would love that
[3:14:27] yanya7701: @jacket__slow ah I thought NA fans got used to bad quality long time again, if not whats the point of you watching at all
[3:14:27] kaboos101: RIOOOOT
[3:14:27] rvollert: Bo1 with 8 teams has been great. LCS just doesn't need a long random break in the middle.
[3:14:33] bii_bella: getting rid of Lucian Nami will increase viewership by 400%
[3:14:38] bondance: @MestasGames instead of playing to 15mins, we should just add winrates for drafted champs together to determine who wins and loses
[3:14:42] kerokerogrips: welcome to being any fan of a team in the eastern leagues
[3:14:49] dropsofliquid: Lucian Nami keep things spicy
[3:14:55] SunnyDavidRS: all of this is moot until LCS starts being consistently at least not embarrassing at worlds (thanks NRG)
[3:14:59] itsDiscoCisco: Bo1 have been fun, i want more games but i feel like if those other 2 teams were there it would be nice
[3:15:10] poisonyvie: I would hope Mark is smart enough to know when we say Bo3, we don't mean just 1 Bo3 per week
[3:15:12] bigdigbanditto: classic chatter
[3:15:36] ProteusWest: @poisonyvie you'll need more than 2 broadcast days a week to pull that off, a lot more
[3:15:39] OUTLANDERau: It clearly going to be a controversial video with lots of commentary!
[3:15:48] bondance: @poisonyvie 1 bo3 per week would just be malicious compliance
[3:15:53] trespasur: do you think this break will hurt viewership? killing the momentum and such
[3:15:59] Niting97: I agree, the people arguing for bo3 saying it'll make us better internationally are delusional.
[3:16:01] jacket__slow: imagine riot broadcasting a clash tournament that is only open to bronze, and then imagine that same tournament... but in best of 3 format LUL
[3:16:01] Maokwa: @poisonyvie but thats what they can afford, 1 bo3 per team max per week. So if you dont want that then you dont want bo3
[3:16:03] peepeedoc: @travisgafford can you clarify how Riot defines "viewership"? Live views only, VODs also? Sry if dumb Q
[3:16:13] Fr0z3nph03n1x: Riot over indexes on random pieces of data.
[3:16:18] ixbx: so after all of this what i'm taking away is Travis likes Bo3 and i should to
[3:16:19] goblilno: breaks are always rough
[3:16:19] kaboos101: sometimes less is more and right now i think they'd attract more viewers who are consistent that way, like dreanor retained more players after the expansion peak compared to other expacs cos there was less content so it was easier for everyone to keep up
[3:16:22] ProteusWest: they wanted to get the LCS back on weekends
[3:16:37] karlheinzstockfootage: @Niting97 better, as in not being swept.
[3:16:38] Maokwa: @niting97 its just huge copium. After a full year of bo3 and we dont so better theyll find some other random bullshit
[3:16:40] dropsofliquid: This break is wild I genuinely thought it was just one weekend until APA said on stream no LCS until freaking March
[3:16:55] thoughtfulcoconut: teams are currently only playing 2 matches a weekend anyway. why not increase your chance at more games with bo3, save money on production and better prepare teams for international? the data is irrelevant when it's consistently ignored lol
[3:17:10] trespasur: valorant makes enough moolah to build its own arena
[3:17:15] SkyeTheX: !discord
[3:17:15] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[3:17:25] kopaka7: where are they saving money on production?
[3:17:28] ProteusWest: when they share arenas nowadays, it's mostly invisible
[3:17:31] jdc009: I like that large break. it helps prevent viewer burnout
[3:17:32] Hack377: Ibai had great numbers when costreaming LEC, has costreaming helped LCS too?
[3:17:32] mithrilblue: i just think Bo3 make way more opportunities for storylines and rivalries to for form going into playoffs. if this is as many matches we get in a split, we should go to LEC format
[3:17:42] MacDaAce: IDK Phoenix Coyotes felt that for decades playing out of the Suns venue
[3:17:44] kopaka7: how do they save it, when travis has explained that keeping the lights on for longer increases costs
[3:18:01] kaboos101: i think it would be cool if they did all the steams on the same day so you could just have lan day with the boys and lcs,lck...
[3:18:02] jacket__slow: "the lesser of 2 evils"
[3:18:13] trespasur: IM  SOOOOOOO BORED OF NO GAMES
[3:18:14] jarryd999: Isn't that two bad decisions because of a planning failure?
[3:18:16] dropsofliquid: People are going to forget it exists
[3:18:18] Maokwa: @thoughtfulcoconut majority of fans would prefer to watch their team play their 2 games on 2 different days than on 1 day back to back
[3:18:29] wiggles10: I went to watch sunday and then remembered there was a break
[3:18:30] dropsofliquid: Ya this weekend people will assume LCS ended or something
[3:18:31] goblilno: =yeah
[3:18:36] goblilno: thats how my buddys see it
[3:18:41] trespasur: like flyquest tried but i dont think it was enough
[3:18:46] nfcpm: @travisgafford the bigger issue is their communications and marketing to the public sucks a ton
[3:18:53] goblilno: causla leaug efans but they still work 9 to 5
[3:18:55] bondance: but Travis, surely the LCS made a point of announcing and explaining what this 2 week void is all about right??
[3:19:00] MacDaAce: 5head plays
[3:19:06] jdc009: at least LCS was left on a fun cliffhanger
[3:19:10] iBlazze: travis thoughts on an Americas League?
[3:19:10] jacket__slow: that doesn't change reality LUL
[3:19:14] mithrilblue: @travisgafford do u think LCS would do better if they tracked with a VCT style league and mid/off season tournies
[3:19:15] itsDiscoCisco: you would think they could at least have LCS stream like old highlights or other types of content to keep up with the viewership time habit that you're talking about
[3:19:16] karlheinzstockfootage: yeah well, cool thing lcs is over way sooner than you think.  riot na is run by boneheads.  glad i have no economic investment.  :)
[3:19:23] Niting97: Well that's what I expect out of an LCS commissioner
[3:19:27] Zerotu14: they def have the money to build another arena no?
[3:19:28] smokepacks: gonna have to regroup and move forward
[3:19:28] dropsofliquid: If mark can time travel he should go save TSM
[3:19:35] ProteusWest: the LCS did explain it pretty well if you watch their content, but casual fans don't really do that
[3:19:43] Maokwa: @zerotu14 no
[3:19:46] thoughtfulcoconut: @Maokwa fans also only care mostly about instant gratification and rarely project the long term
[3:19:47] trespasur: @travisgafford are you gonna be at grand finals?
[3:19:58] Aeldoar: Maybe it's time riot finally do the right thing. Like the multi dollar company blizzard, we need an expansion.. we need LoL 2.. kap
[3:20:03] currymutton: Are you still staying with the Markz?
[3:20:10] Pita26: Mark can't time travel? Why did he get the job then?
[3:20:14] Mushroommeister: Does anyone know if the na server population is growing?
[3:20:15] Pita26: Poor hiring practices
[3:20:27] Maokwa: @currymutton he never was lol
[3:20:28] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford whistling past the graveyard
[3:20:33] grover2734: @currymutton hes roommates with kobe
[3:20:33] MattScoot2: i think the lack of a plan for content during the extended break is an abject failure
[3:20:46] currymutton: Ohhh  my bad
[3:20:46] bigdigbanditto: LUL
[3:20:54] dropsofliquid: Time for ARAM on stage to see how that foes
[3:20:54] Mushroommeister: Yeah I dont think b01 or b03 has anything to do with viewership
[3:21:02] mithrilblue: @travisgafford do you think Riot should have Riot games events like old MLG where Val, League, and TFT have big events same time, same venues
