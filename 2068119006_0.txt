[2:05:25] kkrazy1: @shashuh On hit” refers to every time your champion's auto-attacks land against an enemy target (this may also apply to towers). This means that some effects from items and abilities also apply. For instance, Sheen's effect boosts the damage of the next attack, but this can also be applied to, say, Ezreal's Q ability
