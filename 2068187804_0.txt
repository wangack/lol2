[0:14:22] MrOatmealTV: my sister has that lamp jydnPray
[0:18:01] Skever_: yone moment
[0:20:43] ThomasTheTwink: hiii chatters hiii stunt
[0:21:29] Aerothal: is camille support a new thing?
[0:22:49] BaneBladeV: @ThomasTheTwink  spudsHeart
[0:23:04] ThomasTheTwink: stuntVibe2
[0:25:56] Chrosa: okay stunt i got my keychron keyboard in today. prepare for insane mechanics coming from me now
[0:25:59] kallista27: kallista27 watched 60 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 60 streams!!
[0:27:15] ThomasTheTwink: 60 Pog
[0:28:37] ThomasTheTwink: nerf Zilean kaceyFist
[0:28:39] Chrosa: yea
[0:28:56] Chrosa: I know I am being silly
[0:29:02] Skever_: but do u have good mechanics ?
[0:29:13] Aerothal: i still have my razer blackwiddow ultimate 2013. works like a charm
[0:29:24] jannablowsu: hi cuties
[0:29:26] jannablowsu: AYAYA
[0:29:33] Chrosa: Razer was built diff back ine the day
[0:29:47] Chrosa: my old blackwidow lasted for years
[0:29:58] ThomasTheTwink: hi Janna AYAYA
[0:30:07] marcellui: is this a-z?
[0:30:28] Chrosa: no he finished i believe
[0:30:32] ThomasTheTwink: no he’s just playing Camille
[0:30:47] OmegaMonsoon: I use the Kinesis Gaming FreeStyle Edge RGB with the MX Silver switches
[0:31:02] Chrosa: how do you like the silvers?
[0:31:06] marcellui: i heard this camille shit is good
[0:31:07] crashassh: is camille supp good or troll??
[0:31:23] Aerothal: its our politicians fault really. Germany has a mandated minimum 2 year warranty for any electronic device. that means everything is built better and therefore lasts longer
[0:31:38] OmegaMonsoon: @Chrosa I like them, I feel like they have a great speed to them and great feedback
[0:32:04] Chrosa: they are primarily made for fps right?
[0:33:03] loonaa: some products do last long, but you have to do research to find them. r/buyitforlife is helpful
[0:33:35] Aerothal: well the issue is that 90day warranties are even allowed
[0:33:36] OmegaMonsoon: @Chrosa yea you could say that, they have a shorter distance to go compared to the reds
[0:33:42] ThomasTheTwink: known troll 5tunt
[0:33:49] MrKafay: rooLurk
[0:34:00] MossAlbatross: wooting board is crazy if you really want fast feedback
[0:34:07] crashassh: ty stunt for expressing your conviction to the camille supp
[0:34:11] OmegaMonsoon: @OmegaMonsoon they are supposedly the fastest switches that the cherry mx makes
[0:34:29] Chrosa: @OmegaMonsoon I could never get used to reds. my favs are brown
[0:34:48] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis

[0:36:31] ThomasTheTwink: @voidmoons aloo
[0:36:45] voidmoons: hi thomas owoSpin
[0:36:48] BaneBladeV: aloowo
[0:36:58] Plahbie: alooo
[0:36:58] OmegaMonsoon: @Chrosa Is it because of the the feeling? I know the reds feel lighter even though they are supposedly the same weight or is it the tactile vs linear aspect?
[0:37:00] Aerothal: ff worthy game
[0:37:18] Chrosa: yea reds feel like mush to me
[0:37:21] MossAlbatross: sion is actually bausening correctly wtf
[0:37:43] cloudydaisies: dejj
[0:37:45] voidmoons: PEW PEW PEW
[0:37:46] OmegaMonsoon: @Chrosa you probably wouldnt like silvers than since its basically just red with a shorter distance lol
[0:37:48] Chrosa: like i had no feedback and would always hit the wrong keys
[0:37:59] ThomasTheTwink: death by snowball NotLikeThis
[0:38:17] BaneBladeV: who has healcut
[0:38:33] BaneBladeV: not that it matters much
[0:39:29] Chrosa: I like browns, they are slightly lighter force than blues and they are quieter
[0:39:43] cloudydaisies: alivejj
[0:39:45] Chrosa: blues are also fine though, they feel good to use, they are just loud as shit
[0:40:03] Chrosa: and would likely piss off anyone nearby
[0:40:05] BaneBladeV: @Chrosa I had blues with dampeners on my old keyboard. I can't do them without the dampeners lol
[0:40:24] Chrosa: blues feel great to type with honestly
[0:40:28] OmegaMonsoon: I've never used the blues before, this is my first keyboard with the silvers. I would def get this keyboard again since I love it so much
[0:40:54] Chrosa: reds were a nightmare for typing
[0:41:00] Chrosa: forget a bout it
[0:41:05] MossAlbatross: classic
[0:41:05] enchantixstella: Oops
[0:41:08] BaneBladeV: oopsie

[0:45:03] xaqted1: remember to sat gj
[0:45:29] Cheeseborger1: So dorans blade start is it kinda relying on you getting a kill early?
[0:45:56] Chrosa: i think you go dorans blade/shield if you are planning for early skirmishing levels 1-4
[0:46:06] Chrosa: otherwise sup item is better
[0:46:12] Cheeseborger1: gotcha
[0:46:15] Chrosa: to start anyway
[0:46:33] BaneBladeV: it won't matter in 2 days
[0:46:53] Chrosa: are they nerfing dorans?
[0:47:06] BaneBladeV: no just punishing late supp item
[0:47:07] Bornstellar_Makes: He's back already
[0:47:32] leagueofsuppo: they should make prime sub accessible on twitch mobile
[0:47:41] r3nt0n7: hey stunt hope you're doing well

[0:52:47] Stitch_suplol: TRUE
[0:52:51] Stitch_suplol: only sylas uses it well LMAO
[0:52:53] Chrosa: yeah true that his ult is trash

[0:53:07] TheCoffeeCurator: i fucking hate tresh r idk
[0:53:13] Stitch_suplol: TBH they should nerf his w and buff his e and q
[0:53:17] Stitch_suplol: AND R
[0:53:30] BaneBladeV: I like someone's idea of making it larger with points of R
[0:53:54] Hokego: i want it to be smaller, less play area for them
[0:53:59] ThomasTheTwink: thresh ult should come out around the lantern so u can throw it at people ok
[0:54:13] Aerothal: yone needs a nerf, lol

[1:12:43] lugubrieuzz: banebladeuwu idk what that means
[1:12:47] ArmadylOCE: LS strat :)
[1:13:57] BaneBladeV: @lugubrieuzz it means top lane is wider with less walls, so riot buffed her base stats to compensate. botlane has more walls so support is better now
[1:14:10] lugubrieuzz: ah
[1:18:40] kufuhu: HUH kayle
[1:18:43] Apostolique: Kayle is too OP!
[1:18:49] vrgambit: Kayle getting a double is huge

[1:21:20] ThomasTheTwink: her fear range was huge!
[1:21:43] Apostolique: Maybe Riot likes to see Cam support
[1:21:52] bluegazer1: opprotunity seems good
[1:21:54] leagueofsuppo: how would they even nerf her support stats?
[1:22:32] kuroyami_TV: yasuo totally afk
[1:22:34] Apostolique: Still no type
[1:22:37] Apostolique: Kreygasm

[1:22:58] ThomasTheTwink: hes just on his pve arc
[1:22:59] ThomasTheTwink: its fine
[1:23:29] Apostolique: That would nerf supp Sion BibleThump
[1:23:38] vogue_hommes: make camille ranged hehe
[1:23:43] leagueofsuppo: but that will also nerf her toplane impact
[1:23:54] leagueofsuppo: bloodsong is getting nerfed next patch
[1:24:00] vogue_hommes: vex pepeLost
[1:24:10] Apostolique: @leagueofsuppo On melee too?
[1:24:12] vogue_hommes: @leagueofsuppo only for ranged isn't it?
[1:24:12] ThomasTheTwink: arent they just nerfing ranged blood song
[1:24:16] Apostolique: Last time I checked, it was ranged
[1:24:17] BaneBladeV: @leagueofsuppo just 1% for ranged and that's it. unless there's more they added
[1:24:17] OmegaMonsoon: just ranged
[1:24:27] OmegaMonsoon: and its just going from 6% to 5%
[1:24:31] leagueofsuppo: oh no its just ranged
[1:24:33] BaneBladeV: I think it does nothing
[1:24:42] BaneBladeV: it will still be op on ranged too
[1:24:42] Apostolique: @leagueofsuppo Yo don't scare me like that
[1:25:09] lugubrieuzz: bloodsong is the best supp item imo
[1:25:19] OmegaMonsoon: if they removed bloodsong they better bring back evenshroud
[1:25:20] BlueSNS: so theyre edging?
[1:25:28] leagueofsuppo: dream maker and celestial still my fav out of the batch
