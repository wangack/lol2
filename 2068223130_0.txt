[6:42:23] AbyssionsLoL: u can
[6:42:23] jellifish34: @AbyssionsLoL trailblazer is such a bait item on bard, you dont need the extra ms, and the base stats are extrely gold inefficient
[6:42:47] abel_k9: Deadmans yes
[6:42:47] AbyssionsLoL: ISNT DEADMANS
[6:42:48] AbyssionsLoL: WORSE?
[6:42:50] jellifish34: deadman's is bigger bait Aaaaa

[6:43:13] abyssalskull: who dosnt go ludens on bard?
[6:43:19] AbyssionsLoL: mandate has highest wr
[6:43:20] eggwhiters: but it depends on the match mostly its juzt better to skip it
[6:43:23] AbyssionsLoL: its bis
[6:43:33] CelestlaI: aaaha ha ha..
[6:43:42] jellifish34: @eggwhiters the only reason bard built deadman's was because of the interaction with deadman's and RFC which was removed a few seasons ago; the stats are all bad for bard, passive auto is worse
[6:43:44] abel_k9: Nah
[6:43:44] AbyssionsLoL: wtf?

[6:45:18] Nightbot: KEKW
[6:45:19] AbyssionsLoL: what the fuck is this aatrox build
[6:45:21] jellifish34: @eggwhiters problem is that deadman's offer too little tank stats for it to compete with other armor items; it's bad even for a mere flanking item
[6:45:24] AbyssionsLoL: some people might need band
[6:45:24] CelestlaI: tell waldo to close out of league
[6:45:27] CelestlaI: so we can load in

[6:48:54] SavageSimba: he standing on bidness
[6:48:57] jellifish34: @AbyssionsLoL i asked him, he said repeatedly that it's a bait item; because of the stat; and the ms is gone in combat, which you want because bard wants the ms in battle to find q stun angles

[8:04:54] softymyu: wth , mine was   80 dollars 6 sessions in total
[8:04:59] HoldUpEyy: I mean if you just want something simple to start just do basic bodyweight squats until it feels easy
[8:04:59] bananabread0821: Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[8:05:07] lymia__: thighs basically
[8:05:10] hyooks: its like the front part of ur thigh
[8:05:11] 22nowoman: hyperextension is op
[8:05:11] genio____: quadriceps is the front muscle in your thigh
[8:05:11] abel_k9: It's 4 kills
[8:05:15] abel_k9: :3
[8:05:24] waldodogg: trin you can look like me,...a buff girl (i cant gain weight so i dont look massive):
[8:05:27] abel_k9: Pushups and situps then
[8:05:29] johnn_boyy: I awlays say getting to the gym is the hardest part, but once you put it in the routine of driving and putting aside an hour of your day it will get easier
[8:05:29] genio____: comprised of 4 muscles (rectus and the 3 vastii) = quad
[8:05:30] lilGoobii: And ass?
[8:05:33] gunshii_: you need to be low in body fat for abs and be lean
[8:05:34] hyooks: if you just want to get toned then cardio should be fine
[8:05:35] lymia__: LUL
[8:05:36] realmomo: you can get injured if you deadlift with bad form, but you can also get injured if you do any exercise with bad form. I think the stigma behind dl's are not warrented
[8:05:37] bubbalu99: plank
[8:05:39] abel_k9: Yes you can
[8:05:42] zPoltergeist: u know my dms are always open fr fr

[8:06:20] bubbalu99: pull ups op
[8:06:24] zPoltergeist: it uses arms too
[8:06:26] lymia__: and biceps
[8:06:27] abel_k9: They're hard lol
[8:06:29] gunshii_: if you wanna be toned show muscle, cardio is gonna be your best friend with some bits of weights
[8:06:32] strvnsky: i downloaded an app called home workout and it works for me
[8:06:38] strvnsky: it keeps me active
[8:06:41] gunshii_: while being low in body fat
[8:06:42] HoldUpEyy: I do basic squats, pushups and situps in my room which is super simple and quick imo
[8:06:42] bubbalu99: kinesthetics are op
[8:06:46] cfan247: Lats
[8:06:48] genio____: @gamergirl the best thing is to find a friend who goes to the gym regularly and go to their workouts with them to start. that would be my suggestion. I don't have friends so I used reddit instead LUL
[8:06:49] sazns: Weighted pullups are goated
[8:06:49] Vauhu: when are you goinn to use IG again ? @gamergirl
[8:07:00] gunshii_: mofo wants every physique 😭😭
[8:07:03] abel_k9: Buff girl
[8:07:07] sazns: Tbh just walk an extra hr per day and youll start looking/feeling better
[8:07:11] cfan247: Pullups are your lats
[8:07:16] tinycatalyst: yo
[8:07:17] Nightbot: yo bruh gamergirlPleading
[8:07:36] SavageSimba: i just have tons of s- nvm
[8:07:45] abel_k9: Pullups are hard as fuck ngl
[8:07:46] zPoltergeist: pull ups usually take a lil time to get to
[8:07:48] HoldUpEyy: bro you managed to commit to getting challenger in league which is 100x times harder than getting fit irl
[8:07:49] johnn_boyy: you will need to use the assit pull ups at first
[8:07:51] bubbalu99: do 25 backflips
[8:07:53] sazns: You can do pullups if youre ugly trust
[8:07:54] gunshii_: are you planning to go to the gym or doing home stuff only?
[8:07:56] abel_k9: Start with pushups
[8:07:56] cfan247: Fr I can't do many
[8:07:58] Vauhu: not too buff, oh naah
[8:07:58] genio____: you can do negative pullups. start at the top and lower yourself slowly
[8:08:00] vioplam: gamergirl gym arc gonna be crazyyyy
[8:08:02] johnn_boyy: you can use a band to help you as well
[8:08:19] hyooks: ^^^ negatives or bands
[8:08:24] starlight_aria: do 10 push ups every time you lose a game in league :)
[8:08:26] johnn_boyy: helps you on the way up
[8:08:30] lymia__: was getting chall harder than uni? LUL
[8:08:33] Chipakee: ok manifest and go super saiyan
[8:08:33] Nightbot: @daweoff -> You're mistaken. [stop posting links] [warning]
[8:08:35] hyooks: hardest part is finding a place to do pull ups
[8:08:37] abel_k9: It gives you some tension to go up
[8:08:49] johnn_boyy: no because you cant do one rn so it slowy builds you up
[8:08:51] genio____: you get less gains but you might find it tough to do a single pullup if you've never done one before
[8:08:55] Vauhu: squats are guud for your health
[8:08:57] genio____: it's particularly tough for women
[8:09:04] abel_k9: I mean try one pullup
[8:09:11] johnn_boyy: sqauts are a dull body
[8:09:22] hyooks: squats -> legs, pushups -> chest, pull up -> back
[8:09:33] strvnsky: @Vauhu More never is enough
[8:09:34] genio____: it's moreso that women don't typically train their lats
[8:09:35] tinycatalyst: calisthenics / bodyweight exercises are the way to go imo, can workout at home with zero or very little equipment
[8:09:47] abel_k9: Calisthenics is where you should start
[8:09:49] hyooks: just what muscles they work
[8:09:49] lymia__: good for joints, circulation, balance as well
[8:09:50] Junkee27: depending on the squat, it can expand your heart and lungs, not just legs
[8:09:54] abel_k9: Yeah
[8:09:54] sazns: If you start with bodyweight you should do progressions (like starting pushups on your knees or against a wall/pullups with a band to make yourself lighter)
[8:10:00] Daweoff: If you want a body with good, realistic foundation that you can go into weightlifting with I strongly the book called Professor Attila 5 lbs dumbbell excersies . Its full of excersises and detailed description
[8:10:10] gunshii_: every person is different so tbh just experiment shit you like
[8:10:17] sazns: If you do that guide + eat healthy and track your weight youll transform in 3-4 months
[8:10:35] hyooks: if you get overwhelmed with information easily then best to go with ur sister
[8:10:37] Junkee27: thats a pretty good started guide
[8:10:38] abel_k9: It's just using your body weight. At one point I could push myself up in a handstand
[8:10:38] johnn_boyy: I think you shouldnt overwhelmed yourself with workouts and just get to the gym. Imagine a first time league player and your telling him builds and how to lane
[8:10:41] Nightbot: @genio____ -> I do what I must. [stop posting links] [warning]
[8:10:45] vioplam: ready for top tier bard gameplaya

[8:11:00] genio____: I posted an example
[8:11:04] bubbalu99: lebronJAM
[8:11:05] sazns: Dont overdo it at the start and burnout tho just do whatever you enjoy as long as you're moving more than before
[8:11:10] cfan247: Night
[8:11:15] johnn_boyy: fake
[8:11:22] starlight_aria: Looking
[8:11:24] abel_k9: Not fake
[8:11:34] hyooks: banned
[8:11:34] sazns: Like if you want you could just go hit random machines 3 times a week for 45min and push yourself somewhat and itll be a good start
[8:11:36] berrytaz: You should workout Trin
[8:11:42] abel_k9: She looking toned

[8:45:03] abel_k9: Because it motivates me more when I do workout
[8:45:16] abel_k9: It's the red mouthwash that numbs he was talking about
[8:45:18] Infpwnz: gym is so boring tho
[8:45:25] dophkin: cardio is more difficult than gym imo
[8:45:36] sazns: Could also pick up a sport like climbing or tennis
[8:45:40] shavkat95: @dophkin yes
[8:45:48] abel_k9: You should do smolder uploads and start pumping yt content out
[8:45:51] shavkat95: @dophkin it burns way more calories too
[8:46:17] HoldUpEyy: When I started working out I tried to take a ”progress pic” everyday, its pretty fun to look through them to actually see the progression

[8:47:35] SavageSimba: cardio is good for your heart
[8:47:46] abel_k9: Yeah I'm a little compared wtf
[8:47:51] Narukami______: the only thing that fks with gains is alcohol and lack of food and sleep
