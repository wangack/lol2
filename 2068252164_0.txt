[1:17:08] liver3331: !fiora
[1:17:08] Nightbot: try not to chomp her parry, stay near wall when she ults so she cant get last vital. Not sure if you win level one cause they can just kite. Make sure u do not ult her w extremely important it negates the entire spell everything. DONT q HER W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
[1:17:16] lazmingo: !nasus
[1:17:16] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists

[3:34:28] PrayWMe: !thinking @krozarotk1
[3:34:28] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
[3:34:50] 유튜버이지금: lol
[3:35:11] DeSteino: Oh wow waiting to cancel the tp that's smart :D
