[2:43:43] スカサハ: Modern browsers are memory hungry monsters
[2:44:19] Driveup: instead of getting popped in 0.1 witout them i get popped in 0.5 with them LUL
[2:44:31] スカサハ: Welcome to s14
[2:44:57] tarm0i: damn actually looking good bald just need to be ripped af and ur sexiest yi main 100%
[2:45:00] SovietWrestler: @Driveup Jak'Sho is pretty solid I think in combination with those 2.
[2:45:07] スカサハ: jesus christ that champion
[2:45:21] スカサハ: @SovietWrestler jaksho does nothing to counter burst
[2:45:25] korone_inuwarwik: sterak smart item XD
[2:45:32] Zetx98: I miss gargoyle so much
[2:45:34] Driveup: @SovietWrestler i was thinking that as well, maybe instead of steraks? idk..
[2:45:43] korone_inuwarwik: randium also could help
[2:46:09] SovietWrestler: @Driveup Specifically for burst, I'd say your best choices are using your Q and W correctly.
[2:46:17] SovietWrestler: Item-wise, I don't think you get a lot of choices, lol.
[2:46:30] スカサハ: against ap you have rookern I guess
[2:46:38] SovietWrestler: Yeah.
[2:46:44] Driveup: agreed..............
[2:47:05] LULuser: maybe plated steelcaps if its ad burst, idk how important berserkers is on yi tho
[2:47:10] NeviIyn: im assuming mail works vs shadowflame crit too
[2:47:18] SovietWrestler: @Driveup But I think in most scenarios having your Titanic + Sterak's is already super strong. I doubt there will be a lot of games where they can 1-shot you through those items + your Q/W.
[2:47:19] スカサハ: yones LULW

[2:49:04] Driveup: @SovietWrestler ye in most scenarios you die cause you didnt use your Q or W correctly as you said, but i just wish threre were better choices in items. maybe getting conditioning and revitalize would help
[2:49:09] Zetx98: is terminus a good option ?
[2:49:32] LaatiMafia: @Cowsep We all die eventually Sadge
