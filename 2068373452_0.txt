[1:10:29] StDingus: Because we're missing much of the signal, “instead of seeing a crystal clear photo, you see something that's a little foggy … a little blurred.” The image helps reveal more about the black hole's event horizon — the closest point to which anything can approach the black

[1:10:50] zireaelkekw: it theoritically doesnt make sense to  "see" a blackhole, coz even light escapes it, and the hawking raditiation is out of the visible spectrum. That means you fundamentally cant see it

[1:11:28] sannan4449: @zireaelkekw In simple words, it sucks light in so there is no reflection thus we cant see it
