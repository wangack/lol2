[1:52:12] PeggingPrince: I haven't played league since season 8 because sitting in a 15 minute queue for someone to dodge champ select. I swear I spent as much time out of game as I did in game back then.

[1:57:58] zioh_xo: how you die with dshield second wind
[1:58:21] barelyanonymous: @PAVUQQ looked over your POB -- looks like your base ignite duration is less than a second so chances are you're just not seeing the icon. you want defiled forces to refresh the ignite if you have super low ignite duration
[1:58:25] barelyanonymous: dunno if you're still here or not
[1:58:48] tebz: with what flash..
[1:58:54] barelyanonymous: KEKG

[2:07:42] barelyanonymous: ah yeah, you have to have defiled forces for bossing

[2:42:08] yipztv: galvanic field just saying
[2:42:11] yipztv: could be worth a look
[2:42:17] yipztv: tho idk what this league game is this one weirdge

[2:43:49] Zatodar: eclipse first
[2:43:51] Zatodar: probably
[2:43:55] Alveneb: eclipse op af yea
[2:43:59] PrunJuice: somebody should put together a league gauntlet where every attack has 20 multiproj

[2:45:38] Alveneb: I tried playing with chat disabled, then I got pissed off and did exactly that Smoge
[2:45:41] Zatodar: just contest nocturne's raptors to assert dominance
[2:45:43] Alveneb: enable cuss disable
[2:45:48] Diazanite: junglers get mind controlled by the bugs
[2:46:02] yipztv: DinoDance
[2:46:07] Diazanite: they are forced to take them when their lanes are in the most inopportune state to take the bugs
[2:46:09] Zatodar: supports get mindcontrolled by it too
[2:46:25] Diazanite: they are only allowed to start the bugs when both lanes are in base
[2:46:25] Zatodar: too many games where 1 support roams for grubs and suddenly tower is gone
[2:46:41] Diazanite: so they can ping them when they die at the bugs to the top side of the map
[2:46:48] Alveneb: and just getting drake early is so good, you guys have better lvl 6 so you can fight 2nd bugs
[2:47:08] Zatodar: yes
[2:47:09] Alveneb: yea KEKW
[2:47:31] Alveneb: he's probably duo jg and karthus was saying "all-in him I'll ult"

[2:58:34] drunkhog: This game took part of my soul years ago not played since.  See it has not changed much
[2:59:09] GingerPurple: When i'm playing this game and my friends ask me what i'm playing i respond with "I'm hating myself"
[2:59:25] productivechad: I think everyone should play league to get some thick skin. Would be less snowflakes in the world
[3:00:06] drunkhog: Nothing to do with thick skin...it is expecting others to not be complete ass that gets you
[3:00:24] productivechad: @imexile bro mw2 was the best
[3:00:35] productivechad: u can survive everything after that shit
[3:00:56] beast2: I never roam to help with those KEKW
[3:00:59] Icedragn: it's crazy
[3:01:04] Icedragn: everyone just tries to force that shit for what
[3:01:27] Icedragn: it's totally fine to give grubs and trade dragon, or even trade 2x camp steal
[3:01:32] beast2: just let your wave crash into tower
[3:01:36] productivechad: @drunkhog i mean the think you get said and say to ppl in league makes you have thick skin. You get told 10 times a day to kill ureself and so on
[3:01:37] Zatodar: 5/6 is pretty good but 4 or less is meh
[3:01:38] Icedragn: like they aren't that absurd xdd
[3:01:42] drunkhog: wtf are void grubs

[3:02:21] productivechad: You got smolder on ure team easy win
[3:02:25] productivechad: 225 stacks gg
[3:02:32] drunkhog: @drunkhog I guess for me none of that mattered/bothered me.  It was how bad /braindead people could be
[3:02:36] Bdjoraz: agree
[3:02:40] Bdjoraz: fuck smolder mid
[3:03:03] Bdjoraz: time to pick aurelion

[3:03:05] beast2: I liked playing him in mid, very safe, can take ur junglers wraiths for stacks
[3:03:07] Bdjoraz: for maximum scaling
[3:04:34] Bdjoraz: as soon as he gets his 2nd item feels like E is up all the time
[3:04:39] productivechad: i think he is better bot for faster stacks
[3:04:50] productivechad: im main adc
[3:06:20] productivechad: i was sad to not see you atemt bosses

[3:08:57] Fdx_poe: warlock base g
[3:08:57] try_weii: like to classic/retail pvp/raid all that
[3:09:57] try_weii: what do you think about breaking it out to different subs, likea 3$ m+/raid only sub where you dont level or quest or anything
[3:10:00] productivechad: warlock looks good but im going falkoner with shadowdaggers
[3:10:07] Fdx_poe: world first problem xdd
[3:10:10] try_weii: just have access to the classes and the pve content
[3:10:20] Snakeyesz: they would never do that
[3:10:40] try_weii: it could makethem more money if there are a number of people that pay 0 now
[3:10:42] dylancakes: they'd sooner do xbox pass
[3:10:42] try_weii: but would by that
[3:10:53] Snakeyesz: not only does it make less money, they would need to spend a ton of time implementing that on a technical level
[3:11:09] productivechad: disgusting akali abuser
[3:11:09] try_weii: you might think it makes them less, but you dont know for sure
[3:11:21] Snakeyesz: the only thing wow would change with pricing is adding it to game pass. not even worth talking about anything else tbh
[3:11:40] Snakeyesz: not enough mod density for poe. hope they increase that
[3:11:45] Snakeyesz: mob*
[3:12:00] productivechad: Bro as a adc main i hate you
[3:12:18] Snakeyesz: when did they say they were increasing mob density? was that in the 1.0 notes?
[3:12:28] Fdx_poe: did you give hwei a try?
