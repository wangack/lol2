[2:09:15] friscoborn: The jocks of the universe
[2:09:16] WinglessEvilAngel: The Ruin War is why they hate them.
[2:09:16] chaymand0: @azul_sah Because of a big historical war
[2:09:17] AmakanZ45: mages almost destroyed the world during rune wars

[2:09:50] Shokkundude: @azul_sah also there was this thing called the Rune Wars where mages got access to the World's base code and did not wield that power responsibly
[2:09:50] friscoborn: What? They lost in the Runescape Wars?
[2:09:50] Kurgash: pffft if you’ve got powers why not use them
[2:09:55] AmakanZ45: it’s why Ryze trying so hard to hide the runes
[2:10:00] SirTinyWizard: Garen does not use magic, Garen's Ult is Kayles Sword of Justice

[2:10:08] zelul13: Isn't Jarvan dating a dragon and that is also frowned upon?

[2:10:10] chaymand0: Garen's magic is through Kayle who they worship so they let him off
[2:10:11] Bazeio: girldmAKSHULLY garen in his ult calls for Kayle help

[2:10:42] Bazeio: Why do you think Ryze is collecting the infinity stones
[2:10:47] electrode13_5: @zelul13 he's king, he gets away with that as well
[2:10:53] WinglessEvilAngel: There are these thing call World Rune that are fragments of creation and mage had a whole war over them.

[2:10:54] zelul13: Kindred mains were feasting that day
[2:11:12] Bazeio: @zelul13 about time
[2:11:24] AmakanZ45: Brand and Xerath are the primary examples of why Demacia hates mages.
[2:11:29] swordsmenjay: the still here animation was INCREDIBLE
[2:11:29] Bazeio: About time they remember the GOD OF DEATH exists in their lore
[2:11:35] Kurgash: Marshal Garithos. The most average human racist
[2:12:08] Bazeio: @amakanz45 i dont know about xerath, since it occured in shurima way far from demacia, but Brand 100%
[2:12:19] ynlokk: so, tango
[2:12:28] swordsmenjay: I love the idea of Tyrn literally fighting off death everytime he ults
[2:12:59] WinglessEvilAngel: Ryze is trying to collect all of the World Runes to safe guard them and Demacia was founder to escape the Rune Wars.
[2:13:03] Marokeas72: gosh darn I forgot you played LoL.
[2:13:05] AmakanZ45: @bazeio Demacia doesn’t know about either… yet… but I was using them as examples of corrupted mages utilizing their power to subjugate or destroy
[2:13:13] Kurgash: so thinking about it, one uppity alliance officer caused 3 expansions worth of problems
[2:13:13] Cnaimhin: man I knew you liked toxic men, I didint know it was that bad, you cant fix him DM

[4:37:12] HemilyTiger: There is an island belonging to Norway that has polar bears, inhabitants get told to never leave town without a firearm.
[4:37:22] robveelben: @AmakanZ45 Where I life the boars are about 1m high maybe 1.4m in some cases but they have a lot of mass behind them so my best suggestion to deal with them is to keep a eye on them and walk back they will only charge if they have something to protect or they have some illness
[4:37:23] AmakanZ45: Grizzlies and Polar Bears are just aggressive all the time
[4:37:35] ThyDentar: loop the grizzly
