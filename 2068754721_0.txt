[1:19:36] maxastro0: I mean adcs need perfe t positioning and ghost just makes it so u don't need that for 15 seconds
[1:19:59] syla_isnt_here: have a good stream, good luck with your games :) gn
[1:20:03] maxastro0: But without ghost adc would be a even more miserable positioning

[1:20:44] rafaelneco_isn: yea
[1:20:51] Titusjourney: your girlfrend aswell
[1:20:52] maxastro0: Yeah cuz they don't have the ability to do a sundered sky with aatrox passive ult and e to heal their entire hp bar when they misplay

[4:26:16] glom00: @themanaz with bel in jg u shouldnt be in position to be gankable early game
[4:26:20] sorryitsnothim: @themanaz Contesting is good but she didn't ward early to avoid the gank
[4:26:37] Verrierrr: I was about o ask why comet, but I suppose he jsut picked wrong runes in champ select
[4:26:40] intingkarthus: HUH

[4:27:17] ClydeXander: late night games are all look the same
[4:27:22] ShuIkin: comet aatrox op!? :D
[4:27:24] congasandwich85: so much for "Gwen is immune"
[4:27:24] Verrierrr: is comet secretly OP on Aatrox?
[4:27:31] kaisenqq: !lethality
[4:27:32] Nightbot: you are not zeus, play bruiser or stay low elo
[4:27:43] ThemanaZ: @sorryitsnothim ideally youd want to let aatrox push in wave and save your ward tho no ?
[4:27:52] deminitor: There is two types of challengers, daytime and night-time
[4:28:05] angelo_g1: i think it's good for early low dmg on the q's
[4:28:14] Verrierrr: I'm gonna go ahead and assume it might be underrated in lane, but conq should outperform in teamfights
[4:28:48] kraiserg: night league and day league may as well be different games
[4:29:01] sadsusanmain: jungler try not to throw the game for grubs challenge
[4:29:21] Verrierrr: jnglrs don't know what prio is
[4:29:21] angelo_g1: i call this a series of unfortunate events
[4:29:29] DePRCHK: Just to suffer NotLikeThis
[4:29:43] sorryitsnothim: @sorryitsnothim I don't think so, you get prio and deny aatrox as much before he hits lvl 4/5 as after that aatrox is much stronger so you make use of gwen's stronger lvl 1-3
[4:30:05] angelo_g1: we did not see that
[4:30:24] ArmanMZ: Have you ever regretted maining Aatrox?
[4:30:26] ThemanaZ: @sorryitsnothim +1
[4:30:31] ShuIkin: stream earlier bro i wanna see you vs drututt and hear him cry about aatrox

[4:31:23] Perhapzzz: clean
[4:31:35] sorryitsnothim: @ShuIkin Aatrox isn't too op, it's sundered sky. I hate it
[4:31:35] kraiserg: clean combo nice
[4:31:35] ShuIkin: uff dying on slowpush
[4:31:36] Noelletrox: clean lil kill there
[4:31:38] almightydps1454: That was fcking clean
[4:31:42] Verrierrr: got her with just the edge of Q2
[4:32:15] ThemanaZ: you kinda ran it just now aswell needing to waste flash no ?
[4:32:15] Verrierrr: zoe wins that if she just presses the R in a better spot
[4:32:19] Verrierrr: passive auto kills
[4:32:28] fidelicastro: @sorryitsnothim sundered sky's cd being lowered by ingenious also isnt a fun interaction
[4:32:43] gabrielwasneverhere10: did you now that riot has a fun detector that goes off whenever someone is having fun so they know when to act
[4:33:02] Verrierrr: @gabrielwasneverhere10 its attuned to toplane the most
[4:33:11] salega96: riot can detect my boner
[4:33:13] CarlIstSuper: !lethality
[4:33:13] Nightbot: you are not zeus, play bruiser or stay low elo
[4:33:41] sorryitsnothim: @sorryitsnothim Just the fact that aatrox counterplay is getting up close in melee range so avoid the sweetspots and Sundered Sky removes that counterplay

[4:44:21] Allphas: The zoe E is stupid strong it shaves off % MR  and makes it  true damage.
[4:44:28] Midrang3: commet requires patience and less brawly
[4:44:48] DJENT_tv: @tio_mel think about conq value into jayce
