[2:09:18] pandamixed: literrally just sundered plus steraks or titanic and you're golden
[2:09:18] d1a_lol: i've been watching pobelter for a while now and I can honestly say hes the best streamer to learn aatrox on. from his great mechanics to 200 iq macro plays he has it all. id definately recommend watching for anyone looking to climb or get better on aatrox. If you need the proof I was emerald 1 when I first started watching now im emerald 4
