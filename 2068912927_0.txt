[0:28:41] TheLoho: Deep Rock Galactic
[0:28:48] Sheshantol: DRG survivor is a nice take on survivor games cause it adds mining
[0:28:54] TheLoho: But probably the survivor version of it
[0:29:15] TheLoho: the OG game is super fun with friends. The Survivor version is chill. Nothing crazy tho
[0:29:28] anxiousmess: It's ok imo. Doesn't really add anything new to the genre.
[0:29:37] Sheshantol: for 10 bucks its good
[0:30:11] TheLoho: yeah it's worth the 9 bucks for sure

[2:28:03] m0k3tAl1ty: in my experience eve players arent the most zen to begin with
[2:30:10] bradnickley: LUL
[2:30:10] KormexZJ: LUL

[2:32:46] Lennurd: shut up jinx
[2:34:26] m0k3tAl1ty: i love the timing of that eve ult causing jinx to be hit by the arrow
[2:34:54] mdiesel394: LUL
[2:36:07] m0k3tAl1ty: kat might be a problem
[2:36:09] m0k3tAl1ty: just thinking
[2:37:44] Zetonegi: waaaah
[2:38:06] HardlineBlackSwan: What a beast
[2:38:21] Lennurd: somehow i think jinx is holding down shift
[2:38:32] HardlineBlackSwan: More type = more skill

[2:46:28] wilsonao: Yeah that Ashe arrow didn't hit but... What if it did? Pog
[2:47:06] wilsonao: We dpsin'
[2:47:12] HardlineBlackSwan: Flash in, battle ashe
[2:47:45] antlei1493: gathering storm op then?
[2:48:08] m0k3tAl1ty: i miss ultimate hat on ashe
[2:49:31] wilsonao: Enemy team just getting deleted
[2:50:01] wilsonao: Oh shit against the storm? I love this game
[2:50:17] wilsonao: I have like 500 hours in it
[2:50:25] babaka137: hi
[2:50:26] Smooth711: shoulda asked jinx if he loses
[2:50:27] yashka123123: hi
[2:50:27] wilsonao: I'm an addict
[2:50:52] wilsonao: It does a good job of keeping the game interesting in the way it scales difficulty
[2:51:18] jacksonyee9: what's the game?
[2:51:47] KingofZeal: I've been playing it like an addict for the last two months.  It needs a pretty heavy time investment.
[2:52:10] wilsonao: I'd say each run is like an hour max
[2:52:20] KingofZeal: Depends on how good you are.  Some people can get through one in an hour, if you're slower, maybe 2-3 hours
[2:52:41] wilsonao: Oh yeah I speed the game up a lot now. I guess at the start it took me longer
[2:53:01] KlaviKyle: how's the chally climb?
[2:53:02] wilsonao: But most runs I do in 30-60 min
[2:53:11] babaka137: hi
[2:53:12] yashka123123: hi
[2:53:21] KingofZeal: I wish I could play that fast, I'm too cautious with my decision making so it ends up longer
[2:53:32] wilsonao: I just pause a lot tbh lol
[2:54:03] FooBarBazQuux: 3 assassins, yikes
[2:54:17] wilsonao: There is a ton of novel strategy to figure out in it depending on all the modifiers you get each run and the stuff you run into
[2:54:38] wilsonao: That's what's fun about it for me imo
[2:54:51] CannabisKidPurp: guys when is imperial mandate the move for ashe support
[2:55:43] CannabisKidPurp: u go it every game? ah okay, thanks
[2:58:02] wilsonao: Uh ohhhhh
[2:58:08] LordAudacity: lol
[2:58:45] wilsonao: KEKW
[2:58:48] FooBarBazQuux: lmao
[2:59:10] wilsonao: David doesn't know the secret: bot lane doesn't matter
[2:59:50] FooBarBazQuux: you’re chilling, it’s Emerald
[3:00:33] wilsonao: Hit em with the ol' "don't worry we scale"
[3:00:47] geeko101: all ad
[3:01:42] FooBarBazQuux: yasuo wins these
[3:02:32] wilsonao: Yasuo about to hit 1/9 powerspike
[3:02:45] FooBarBazQuux: LUL
[3:03:14] Lennurd: how lose
[3:03:21] FooBarBazQuux: David tilted
[3:04:10] wilsonao: Best dragon call
[3:04:16] HardlineBlackSwan: You're not doing a dragon, you're leashing it. SV, never wrong
[3:04:55] wilsonao: One day we will be 6
[3:05:35] wilsonao: Hmmmm yasuo is not feeling okay
[3:06:31] HardlineBlackSwan: Nobody expects the frontline MF
[3:08:24] FooBarBazQuux: Yasuo super clean
[3:09:16] wilsonao: David is so done mentally lol
[3:10:08] LordAudacity: geez
[3:10:17] wilsonao: Just win EZ
[3:10:21] LordAudacity: adcs are useless anyhow
[3:10:56] wilsonao: Yeah just tell him his role is useless. That'll cheer him up
[3:11:00] HardlineBlackSwan: That's what ADC means right? Always Dead and Carried
[3:11:11] LordAudacity: i mean hes already crying
[3:11:48] FooBarBazQuux: They never expect the frontline MF instant ult
[3:12:06] Wiznatts: comebackable
[3:12:27] wilsonao: We already came back let's go
[3:12:39] LordAudacity: its been winnable
[3:12:50] FooBarBazQuux: Yasuo is huge
[3:12:55] wilsonao: David just needs to know that lane phases are 4fun
[3:13:58] HardlineBlackSwan: People always forget that winning a game requires playing well for like 25-30 min, throwing a game only takes playing poorly for 10-15min
[3:15:37] wilsonao: I feel like I never get tilted playing support. Adc though I was perma tilted.
[3:15:59] FooBarBazQuux: Yeah ADC is a tilting role
[3:16:15] wilsonao: ADC just feels unrewarding to play while support is "yeehaw partner!" Time
[3:16:24] FooBarBazQuux: LUL
[3:17:17] SquirrelMaster61985: SEE
[3:17:19] SquirrelMaster61985: ITS WINNABLE
[3:17:22] FooBarBazQuux: joever

[3:18:49] geeko101: meanwhile, on raptors
[3:18:52] wilsonao: David is never talking to us again
[3:19:14] fatguy925: lol
[3:19:31] FooBarBazQuux: Holding him hostage
[3:20:42] LordAudacity: rylais before liandres
[3:21:21] FooBarBazQuux: comeback starts now
[3:22:20] LordAudacity: hahahahahaha
[3:22:29] wilsonao: I would just not put riot in my name tbh
[3:23:18] FooBarBazQuux: Reported.
[3:23:36] LordAudacity: report
[3:23:56] FooBarBazQuux: MF useless
[3:23:56] fatguy925: LUL
[3:23:57] wilsonao: KEKW
[3:24:15] Aaylas: That's his first rough game ever
[3:24:21] wilsonao: Honestly he hard tilted from that one early fight
[3:24:36] FooBarBazQuux: The flash heal into not focusing Draven
[3:24:37] HardlineBlackSwan: Banned for not picking Maokai
[3:24:55] Bharadrahmakh: oh nice, are you playing some Against the Storm on the side? :o
[3:25:14] fatguy925: no its only background Kappa
[3:25:32] Bharadrahmakh: I know that's a picture, but if he has a desktop pic of it... :p
[3:26:00] fatguy925: kimichi plays when kimichi has the computer
[3:26:26] Bharadrahmakh: ahh, fun game :D
[3:26:52] FooBarBazQuux: Pretty sure you should just walk down, he can flash you but he flashes into kindred then
[3:27:28] FooBarBazQuux: but that wasn’t game over anyway
[3:27:31] Bharadrahmakh: its real!
[3:27:59] wilsonao: Dwarves best woodcutters
