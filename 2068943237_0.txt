[2:21:18] Ekozera: Wing was saying that subs are getting raised in price in Canada. Iâ€™m just so triggered about price gouging these days. Did you know that the same Canadian carrots package is sold 1.1Cad in Missouri but 3 time as much in the province it was grown in? Canada is getting mass extorted across the board and Iâ€™m just so fucking done with it.
