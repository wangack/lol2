[0:14:35] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: yes
[0:14:35] kasttne: Xun surely have not a good series against ig
[0:14:55] topalphadog1: Brand jungle seems strong
[0:15:00] Fissiccisst: Honest question: WHY is brand jungle so meta? what about him makes it so good?
[0:15:07] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @Fissiccisst clear speed
[0:15:21] studboy68: brand just a strong champ and brand 1 shots camps and objectives
[0:15:21] Fissiccisst: NOTED
[0:15:27] Phixos2: Hey monte does it not bother you how much Thorin cuts you off on SI? Not trying to flame but I notice it happens a lot, like a lot a lot
[0:15:39] Kufner: how do you feel about that artifical jungling jungler changes by just buffing damage specfically to monsters
[0:15:51] Shimmerz: max health % damage champs are gold efficient
[0:15:57] azzlo3: I hate that they buffed brand jungle, it was viable before they buffed it and was a completely slept on pick ,but riot had to go and make it super overpowered now everyone plays it
[0:16:27] isaenzf: bullying the kasante
[0:16:27] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:16:29] studboy68: he utilizes the mage items well too and they’re probably the strongest of the preseason changes
[0:16:33] MoonKnightByNight: This is leyan's first match with IG right?
[0:16:34] Kufner: same fate as morgana jungle
[0:16:36] ThunderBobo: they did
[0:16:41] ThunderBobo: in 14.3
[0:16:41] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: do u really think zeri is broken @MonteCristo
[0:16:51] kasttne: @moonknightbynight no they played in IG in the past too I think
[0:16:53] Goreng: Chat, I just joined. did monte said anything about camile v ksante matchup?
[0:16:53] azzlo3: morgana jungle is still playable IMO she just scales really bad
[0:16:56] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: not right now
[0:16:58] disqovering: Do you think it's better for leagues when there isn't an undisputed no1 team?
[0:17:01] Shimmerz: in before phreak says it’s actually lee sin that’s the problem with brand jungle
[0:17:12] Aconomo: Isn't it irresponsible to let an arsonist run a muck in the jungle?
[0:17:15] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: but shjes so fun to play
[0:17:17] PinnxelGRP: thank you to IG for making T1 the best team in the world. real recognizes real
[0:17:24] kasttne: Leyan are the sub JG for IG In the times 2018/2019 no?
[0:17:24] Naxser: @MonteCristo Zeri is another victim of the Ryze Syndrome :v
[0:17:43] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: the classic lpl roam top
[0:17:58] topalphadog1: BLG not respecting IG
[0:18:11] isaenzf: ye
[0:18:11] MoonKnightByNight: ^
[0:18:11] PinnxelGRP: 2/0 camille against K'sante monkaS
[0:18:19] Goreng: I think they dont know that YSKM not going top?
[0:18:28] isaenzf: is camille meant to be good against ksante
[0:18:39] PinnxelGRP: you should know im here
[0:18:57] livekal: filtered/drip coffee or espresso
[0:19:01] saberaxe: that ward is not in range
[0:19:04] Goreng: you should know camile
[0:19:06] PinnxelGRP: you should know he plays k'sante
[0:19:13] kasttne: Xun is a bit overrated..... personally
[0:19:22] saberaxe: it is blocked
[0:19:29] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @kasttne no, he just played like shit
[0:19:31] Goreng: @saberaxe its a pink
[0:19:37] 7ekje: thats his pink ward he cant see the blue ward
[0:19:39] saberaxe: I thought you were talking about the blue ward
[0:19:40] MoonKnightByNight: How can leyan be such a big change in a single series for ig
[0:19:44] saberaxe: that lee walks by
[0:19:46] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: what r u talking about bro
[0:19:48] kasttne: @fnc_airport_run_kekw I mean he has some int moments too
[0:20:11] Fissiccisst: I read his name as Skyrim LUL
[0:20:18] Fissiccisst: instead of YSKM
[0:20:33] PinnxelGRP: did he know ahn has cleanse LUL
[0:20:45] MoonKnightByNight: Isnt wink an adc before?
[0:20:47] Goreng: @PinnxelGRP I mean, trading ult for cleanse aint bad
[0:20:47] studboy68: he thinks he can sneak the crab but doesn’t know he’s on the ward because of the pink angle
[0:20:54] saberaxe: yeah
[0:20:54] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @PinnxelGRP @Goreng he flashed
[0:20:55] disqovering: I mean idk what Xun was doing. EVEN if he wanted to go into river, why go through top instead of bot bush
[0:20:56] PinnxelGRP: @Goreng I thought he flashed as wel
[0:20:58] skaddyworlds: wink
[0:21:14] Goreng: @PinnxelGRP oh he did? nvm then

[0:21:31] kasttne: Xun is certainly the weak link of this BLG team
[0:21:37] skaddyworlds: ^? XD
[0:21:46] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: bro why do you hate xun
[0:21:48] skaddyworlds: what are we saying dude. Xun is awesome

[0:22:22] Corrrr_: they didn't get drake
[0:22:23] xJesta90: not ig
[0:22:33] kasttne: And for me he's not a LPL top 3 JG even in last year @fnc_airport_run_kekw
[0:22:38] disqovering: I wouldn't say Xun is a weak link. bro had 1 bad series where they prep'd for a different jungler
[0:23:05] kasttne: @disqovering I mean don't forgot the series that he inted against T1 last worlds
[0:23:08] Fluffieface: are we doing 365 days of streaming?
[0:23:21] skaddyworlds: gotta respect Xun for playing carry champs every game. fun to watch (just not this series KEKW )
[0:23:39] disqovering: he also pulled him out of lee Q
[0:23:41] Goreng: that was a panic ult
[0:23:43] TilNextTyme: What do you think of You Should  Know Me?
[0:23:56] a_lonely_observer: GIGACHAD IG

[0:25:07] xJesta90: i think yskm a little greedy there, uting for renata
[0:25:13] disqovering: Do you think it's better for the LPL if BLG isn't undisputed first?
[0:25:34] Sparkyyyyyyyyyyy: OFF LUL
[0:25:34] Goreng: Silly player as in coinflip?
[0:25:34] TilNextTyme: what do you mean by silly? as in fun?

[0:27:04] topalphadog1: KEKW
[0:27:31] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: Siege
[0:27:33] fcloud: @MonteCristo what about transitioning to things you hate that make no money? seems like the obvious next step
[0:27:51] Talsifer: Just be honest Monte, you can't quit like the rest of us
[0:28:04] Shimmerz: Monte have you tried being poor
[0:28:04] Sparkyyyyyyyyyyy: @fcloud hots?
[0:28:19] azzlo3: @fcloud 5Head
[0:28:30] onafets_1: guys... the question was about "what if I stop doing this, what am I suposued to do" it was not about oh please stop league

[0:29:01] livekal: sorry but what was bad about riot? like salary issues?
[0:29:05] Shimmerz: the old Jacob wolf strategy
[0:29:06] Fissiccisst: just do what all CEOs do, self sabotage, steal all the money, fire everyone and then golden parachute out
[0:29:07] nautcholibre: Helllo everyone ready for a new night of bangers!!!
[0:29:14] Aero_23o: @fissiccisst yes, you find a game in Na within 5-40 seconds
[0:29:37] Fissiccisst: @Aero_23o oh cool. I loved hots way back when
[0:29:43] azzlo3: nobody runs out of mana anymore, I feel like its a thing that nobody talks about that has actually removed a lot of macro skill from the game
[0:30:09] onafets_1: @livekal riot as toxic (probably still is) about contracts, not only $, but the contracts
[0:30:11] Im_Rubic: Hello :)
[0:30:16] Shimmerz: Monte will be like Samuel l Jackson in pulp fiction, he will wander the earth, although we have a name for that… a bum
[0:30:27] TommyLoko_: do you play league at all now?
[0:30:27] nautcholibre: no one can replace you @montecristo!
[0:30:29] cramviderde: have you ever gotten into TFT?
[0:30:29] Fissiccisst: Monte just likes hanging out with all of us. Thats definitely it
[0:30:33] Zoraion: A MonteCristo cooking show would be a banger
[0:30:44] Goreng: !book
[0:30:44] NutellaHappens: Tbh I think league the game is in a really good place competitive wise
[0:31:17] Zoraion: Did you have anyone mentor you in cooking, or did you just learn how to cook by yourself?
[0:31:19] Im_Rubic: Is there any type of cuisine you struggle to make that you wish you could?
[0:31:21] mimik_xg: If you could choose a cooking brand/product to sponsor you, what would it be? :o
[0:31:25] LilGimli: lets get a monte BJJ video
[0:31:30] cramviderde: i love league but feel like comp for the first time ever, has become a tad stale. I think fearless draft is necessary moving forward and soon

[0:31:50] Fluffieface: not a great baker..... yet
[0:31:51] fatalqwerty: thoughts on potential shift of meta to bruiser/duelists like Fiora/Camille?
[0:31:51] Fissiccisst: Do you guys feels the number of viable champions has gone up over the years? thats always what I've kinda wanted: a lot more champ variety
[0:31:52] disqovering: imo a big factor in the east's superiority over the west is the whole pc bang culture, do you agree?
[0:32:06] isaenzf: amazon fresh be top

[0:34:18] AzureCatalyst: I think Work Ethic and Hierarchical structures/seniority respect is wayyy more important
[0:34:29] Fissiccisst: Born 20 years too early to be a esports pro peepoSad
[0:34:35] fatalqwerty: I would love to see how meta-shift to duelists/split-pushers changes your power rankings, I'm sure a lot of the top 10 teams will tank
[0:34:42] yanya7701: FLY is not good
[0:34:43] PapaSmithy: well nrg > g2 and they are 4-5
[0:34:45] rilsolo: yes

[0:34:46] PapaSmithy: so flyquest seems fucking strong no
[0:34:51] disqovering: I feel like in the west gaming still has a somewhat negative connotation, at least the amount of gaming needed to go pro
[0:34:57] thikyy: busio is NA keria
[0:35:09] nautcholibre: I don’t like new rift herald.

[0:36:45] Aero_23o: @papasmithy we need Fly ToadAmarillo rn, if you control Spain it's gg
[0:36:56] WashedxUp222: varus with a bad ult
[0:37:12] fatalqwerty: @onafets_1 @SirRubixx Neat! Gonna be hype to have tourney back in China
[0:37:19] nautcholibre: so shockwave secondary engage
[0:37:47] mikejanderson: good old nautilius
[0:37:54] disqovering: for this comp to work, BLG would need to be first to obj no?
[0:38:16] Fissiccisst: Wink is working so hard in these fights
[0:38:18] onafets_1: @fatalqwerty for me its the soloq streams in China that gets me hyped
[0:38:28] nautcholibre: if that varus ult hits do they win the fight ?
[0:38:43] kasttne: The level of LPL in general seems to be Lower compared to last year in my opinion
[0:39:11] WashedxUp222: Wink has been solid
[0:39:21] disqovering: unrionically, would it be good to varus R naut? to give Lee space to get in the back
[0:39:28] reremremm: Ok blg fanboys riddle me this if blg is strongest team then why they lost to ig 2-0? Oh I see maybe t1 lost to geng because they won worlds and they don't need to prove anything on spring lck
[0:39:38] FannyBabbs: winter is LPL happy game split
[0:39:45] fatalqwerty: If you put FLY in China right now where will they be in the rankings?
[0:39:47] e6merald6: they get lunar new year buff
[0:39:49] skaddyworlds: true @reremremm
[0:39:49] kasttne: BLG have fans?
[0:39:50] kaida_shimazaki: I still remember Xun in IG days lol
[0:39:53] WashedxUp222: He was really good at csing with naut lol
[0:39:58] onafets_1: @reremremm tbh its been like 4 years t1 lose to geng?
[0:39:59] topalphadog1: @reremremm not respecting their opponents KEKW
[0:40:01] PinnxelGRP: yeah C9 kinda stomps LPL no?
[0:40:06] Rumblextristana: @MonteCristo What are your thoughts on YSKM?
[0:40:08] nautcholibre: so many people in low elo don’t understand Naut ult and will flash into there team and end up knocking more people up, as a Naut main I don’t complain.
[0:40:11] saberaxe: Is Cryin still good on roaming mids? like TF Tali?
[0:40:13] squires: I feel like LPL talent is a little more concentrated thus year too
[0:40:14] OvtForeverFall: bro should go watch SI
[0:40:29] Fissiccisst: is this his first game or something?
[0:40:38] skaddyworlds: THE SHY REGEN
[0:40:46] fatalqwerty: so is YSKM the Chinese BRO Morgan
[0:40:47] Talsifer: I like his name
[0:40:47] mikejanderson: would be cool if ig keeps this up and be a contender for top 3-4
[0:40:59] azzlo3: bring back the 1800 jatt dilemma, T1 losing to Geng proves the LCK is strong and therefore T1 is good, whereas BLG losing to IG means LPL is bad and therefore BLG is bad
[0:41:01] Talsifer: YSKM is such a banger name imo
[0:41:05] saberaxe: flashed the kick
[0:41:20] WashedxUp222: is camille his best champ?
[0:41:23] nautcholibre: that new baron does some big damage
[0:41:24] saberaxe: and Xun had no flash yet
[0:41:25] kasttne: @azzlo3 surely
[0:41:28] kaida_shimazaki: YSKM the hong kong represent
[0:41:59] fatalqwerty: that was a neat flank by YSKM
[0:42:00] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:42:16] disqovering: in the topic of top laners, how highly do you rate Dudu?
[0:42:37] MrBlueLlama: I really like the baron changes, interesting to see new of ways of approaching baron
[0:42:55] MrBlueLlama: For red side in this scenario compared to the old map
[0:43:28] dakwka: at worst it would be 1-1 trade for IG
[0:43:28] Fissiccisst: I think he'd hit the wall
[0:43:41] 7ekje: another bad varus ult
[0:43:46] rilsolo: maybe bin can get in range to ult him over a wall?
[0:43:46] disqovering: I think he would kick him in an angle he could get caught by renata no?
[0:43:48] Meduhpg: they just 1 tap him in cc prob but ye not worth anyway
[0:44:07] squires: All that aside, I don't think you can go for that play if Brand has flash up
[0:44:41] dakwka: BLG running a classic T1 comp with varus/renata/ori/ core but they don't know the timings and plays as well
[0:44:44] disqovering: kind of a hail mary
[0:44:57] FuumaX: these varus r's have been bad
[0:44:57] Rysikoss: @MonteCristo they didn't have vision over senna and naut, the pink came down later
[0:45:55] pandagrog: carry junglers are finally back FeelsStrongMan
[0:46:19] SonsOfJarvan: This looks like normal sports, when u focus on the big match (Blg vs  Jdg saturday) and the "easy match" results on the contrary
[0:46:28] hiimaeia: ngl man im pretty scared for T1, they've been running the same core champs over and over
[0:46:48] ThunderBobo: LUL
[0:47:03] Fissiccisst: Wink cannot be stopped
[0:47:03] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:47:05] TheEdwynShow: IG finallly back after 4 years? maybe
[0:47:10] j34j34: wink mvp
[0:47:15] squires: Wink got longer hooks on Naut somehow
[0:47:19] TilNextTyme: that hitbox busted. wild lollipop
[0:47:21] GiraffeusPoly: who would you say are the best teams in LPL right now?
[0:47:22] cramviderde: IG is FUN
[0:47:22] kasttne: @hiimaeia scared in what sense?
[0:47:24] disqovering: Wink is developing nicely, last year he was kind of just the adc who role swapped now he feels legit imo
[0:47:31] dakwka: @hiimaeia Eh I think they have been experimenting in sidelanes with faker bringing the reliable and stable picks to balance out the craziness
[0:47:31] pandagrog: @TheEdwynShow this is the same thing that happened last Spring. Dont get your hopes up Aware
[0:47:35] hiimaeia: why does IG always seem to beat the good teams in regular season lol
[0:48:13] pandagrog: @hiimaeia they are fearless and fast paced
[0:48:23] MrBlueLlama: LPL split is kind of crazy, high chance IG was just more prepped for this specific match.
[0:48:40] hiimaeia: @dakwka maybe, but eh, just seems like the topside's been so static in picks lately, more so worried for faker's champ pool, it has not changed since 2022 summer
[0:48:41] disqovering: senna for varus feels bad against IG no? with both IG bot laners able to play adcs decently
[0:48:49] saberaxe: Even when they had push senna was roaming and Naut could sit under tower
[0:49:26] PinnxelGRP: does having longer hair give anyone else a headache
[0:49:36] skaddyworlds: DANKIES
[0:49:38] hiimaeia: karma seems like a bait pick for most top teams
[0:49:55] hiimaeia: knight and chovy dont strike me as karma players
[0:50:35] disqovering: engage aatrox
[0:50:40] MrBlueLlama: Best chance is a good aatrox flank
[0:50:41] TheEdwynShow: @TheEdwynShow Hey its not the summer this time its the spring
[0:50:45] TheEdwynShow: I dont like knight on karma
[0:50:49] saberaxe: 2 enchanters and 2 adcs
[0:50:55] lunar_ten9: rell better than kindred here ?
[0:50:59] hiimaeia: this looks like a steriotypical T1 comp, just poke and hope to flank with aatrox
[0:51:01] azzlo3: lucian auto is primary engage Kappa
[0:51:03] Covefiel: cant they use a Draven leona instead?
[0:51:05] TheEdwynShow: If I see knight on karma I see that as a win
[0:51:28] disqovering: if it was Beryl Milio, you could call Flash Q as engage lol
[0:51:40] pandagrog: i guess they think they have enough dissengage with Milio, Karma, Kindread
[0:51:42] MrBlueLlama: Varus ult and naut ult are also non commital, BLG has to just put them selves in there
[0:51:49] a_lonely_observer: The ai thinks blg has the better draft
[0:52:03] Dreamchosis: yo @MonteCristo i rewatched the pure pwnage movie the other day and forgot you were in it. what was it like working with those dudes and being a part of it

[0:54:09] rfarleydude97: i gotta say, the JFK question/comment by buttponder420 on last nights SI was fucking hilarious
[0:54:26] Manjiji: LUL
[0:54:44] disqovering: KDF enjoyer BASED
[0:54:47] Alexo_exo: @disqovering monte loves KT, he thinks they will win world every year Keepo
[0:54:55] a_lonely_observer: No during the draft the banner above the picks said blg draft was next level while ig draft is excellent
[0:54:57] hiimaeia: afreeca's fun, bulldog's suddenly stable mid to late
[0:55:04] TheEdwynShow: Afreca is Kwangdong Freecs right ?
[0:55:13] isaenzf: varus used heal :o
[0:55:17] pandagrog: i was a TT fan.. now im no longer.
[0:55:17] azelikk: why did ahn use heal
[0:55:21] san2194: @Alexo_exo Yes, he has loved them ever since they were KT Arrows
[0:55:34] S1lentSymphony: If Gen.G get everything dialed in, they're going to be practically unstoppable.
[0:55:39] SonsOfJarvan: NS looks like the weaker version of KDF, they fun to watch too
[0:55:40] TheEdwynShow: I think DUDU is the 2nd best toplaner that dude is good
[0:55:47] nautcholibre: @disqovering He loved KTs jungler this year! MiniK
[0:55:59] JuCiEe19: wait is IG just good or fluke
[0:56:05] disqovering: Cuzz needs a title like BRO players with how he's been playing. Colonel Cuzz
[0:56:06] hiimaeia: @s1lentsymphony idk man, i dont trust lehends
[0:56:08] rfarleydude97: LMAOOOO
[0:56:16] lunar_ten9: well, gg LUL

[0:56:24] Crushzilla: ff
[0:56:25] TilNextTyme: 40 health
[0:56:25] isaenzf: that fucking hurts
[0:56:35] NorseThunder: as a jungler, I am throwing up right now
[0:56:36] pandagrog: @JuCiEe19 they are good but this win vs Blg is def a fluke
[0:56:44] disqovering: @nautcholibre you mean former world champion, NA talent Pyosik?
[0:57:08] JuCiEe19: @JuCiEe19 ok ok i dont have time to watch lpl so the standings confuse me a lot

[0:57:08] TheEdwynShow: @JuCiEe19 I dont think a 2-0 is a fluke though
[0:57:10] a_lonely_observer: Pyosik is legit NA talent, he learned the rammus here
[0:57:11] hagatha111: good luck playing carry jg
[0:57:25] isaenzf: ballz'o'steel
[0:57:25] Fissiccisst: I love that video
[0:57:27] maratduo: KEKW
[0:57:44] nautcholibre: @disqovering Why of course! He is in fact a world champion and
[0:57:44] disqovering: Pyosik just had to get some burgers in his veins to play better
[0:57:50] Alexo_exo: HUH
[0:57:55] pandagrog: @TheEdwynShow If they win vs another top tier team then yes its not.
[0:58:11] S1lentSymphony: @hiimaeia I hear you. I'm a T1 fan first. Which is why its an *if*. If they all dial it in, and get the super team functioning optimally?
[0:58:24] hakushiv: What happened to the english coverage of the LCK and LPL?
[0:58:27] KingTyonidas: is IG good or was their schedule week
[0:58:36] nautcholibre: @disqovering Pyosik might be the best jungler in the world!
[0:59:03] pandagrog: the only other top team they faced was NIP and they got smashed by them
[0:59:11] AntiquusTonitrus_3: ex junger teamates facing off here
[0:59:14] TilNextTyme: ive watched them a couple of times and IG do seem like a top 6 team. maybe not top 3 though
[0:59:22] TilNextTyme: in lpl
[0:59:23] disqovering: I don't think this series means much, first series for BLG after CNY and vs a jungler they must've not prep'd a lot for
[0:59:41] hiimaeia: @s1lentsymphony I agree, just that I think Lehends is top 3 supp at best. But they do have a monster topside, maybe a better one than T1 at their peak.
[0:59:48] FumaK0tar0: which playstyle of senna do you think is better (feasting/farming)
[0:59:58] AzureCatalyst: OOO Pizza

[1:08:12] Stormserpent101: @fatalqwerty could legit take up till the last week
[1:08:23] erich1510: I split six months across Korea and Japan on a NYC corporate six figure salary, but the caveat is that I had to stay up and work american eastern coast hours. My coworkers think I am crazy for not sticking around in NYC as somebody in my 20s. Like I'm sorry I'm not paying eighty dollars and a 20% tip for a night out and live in a shoebox
[1:08:31] disqovering: the more I look at BLG draft the sadder I get. No engage, not much disengage, no tank
[1:09:46] dakwka: do you own a house in Korea
[1:09:48] Kaniskion: six figure salary but not subbed Susge
[1:09:56] AzureCatalyst: Susge

[1:11:22] AzureCatalyst: WOOO
[1:11:24] AzureCatalyst: It worked
[1:11:29] 1080tigpu: kkkkkk
[1:11:32] Prepo9: @paaaanda1 FPX played it as well
[1:11:39] AzureCatalyst: Graves just disemboweling Kindred right now
[1:11:46] TastyAMG: xdd if you can't afford $5 a month why are you watching a stream instead of getting your money up - MonteCristo 2024

[1:11:49] fistigons25: @montecristo have you ever tried any Filipino food?
[1:11:51] AzureCatalyst: Kindred literally got her organs harvested while that bot int happened xdd
[1:11:52] PinnxelGRP: there is nothing more toxic than a graves that is mega ahead
[1:11:59] dakwka: are we back to carry junglers what's up with this matchup
[1:12:05] thevirtuousgecko: Farming junglers that are levels ahead of laners gives me a boner every time NGL
[1:12:09] esports_martin_luther: I published my theses, and the people listened
[1:12:11] yanya7701: so theres no English broadcast of LPL these days?
[1:12:14] topalphadog1: I miss adcarry graves
[1:12:24] TastyAMG: LPL never left the carry jungle meta
[1:12:25] nautcholibre: so if I wanted to become an analyst of league is it just watching games and coming up with my thoughts and being able to explain to people. I’m a teacher so it seems like I could teach someone league even if I’m gold @montecristo
[1:12:26] esports_martin_luther: no more indulgences for you4
[1:12:36] AzureCatalyst: Those are the best games Sadge

[1:12:42] DixMX: farming junglers are always meta IF laners are confident enough
[1:12:43] disqovering: Let's go guys, carry junglers are back when LEC *cough* Bo *cough* are on break. GG
[1:12:45] aoiHydra: xun, leyan and milkyway all decided to play carry junglers yesterday it was super fun

[1:12:51] dakwka: Canyon is gonna go crazy w jungle graves being viable
[1:12:57] yanya7701: oh
[1:12:59] nautcholibre: he nailed them to the door
[1:13:03] Prepo9: @paaaanda1 Milkyway played Kindred twice vs LNG and popped off
[1:13:08] Wando05: @MonteCristo do you know what monitor size tournament play uses?
[1:13:08] esports_martin_luther: must have gotten lost in the mail
[1:13:18] PinnxelGRP: this is a pretty dry 2-0 tbh
[1:13:30] paaaanda1: @Prepo9 okay, ty, i just know Xun plays these carry styles a lot, dont keep up with LPL a lot outside of just baseknowledge of players
[1:13:34] disqovering: imagine Bo Graves in LEC Sadge
[1:13:38] AzureCatalyst: I'm excited for the Chovy Karma with Canyon Graves invading Peanut ViperDespair
[1:13:44] fatalqwerty: wait so BLG is just gonna lose 0-2 like this?
[1:13:59] DixMX: @disqovering surely Saken and Cabochard will allow Bo to play properly

[1:14:35] disqovering: @disqovering I mean, I could see KC playing with this IG draft
[1:14:37] brandofan2: did we already do fpx vs lng
[1:14:48] scamdemic19: how to play kasante: ste0 1
[1:14:57] AzureCatalyst: @disqovering I could imagine cabochard inting to an aatrox and saken not hitting a neeko ulti on more than 2 people
[1:15:16] AzureCatalyst: While Bo tries to carry the dead weight that is Targamas' dead corpse
[1:15:24] aoiHydra: fpx topside played pretty well
[1:15:24] thevirtuousgecko: Who you got KT vs HLE later today?
[1:15:29] AzureCatalyst: KT
[1:15:37] disqovering: how to play k'sante: step 1: build tank, I mean damage step 2: turn monitor off
[1:15:46] SonsOfJarvan: Ez money
[1:15:49] thevirtuousgecko: HLE are frauds
[1:15:51] AzureCatalyst: Pyosik about to put on the GOAT performance for his favorite KT Fan Monte OMEGALUL
[1:15:54] FumaK0tar0: Judging by this performance do you think ig are a legit contender for the top 10?
[1:16:00] nautcholibre: guys @montecristo back on the KY hype train!!!!!
[1:16:01] SonsOfJarvan: HLE frauds with no chovy nor peyz/ruler
[1:16:02] 1080tigpu: hle lost bad to t1
[1:16:02] dakwka: Getting excited for KT Susge
[1:16:15] thevirtuousgecko: Hle got railed by geng as well
[1:16:16] PinnxelGRP: Wouldn't it be a KT thing to win Worlds with this lineup Susge
[1:16:16] aoiHydra: @FumaK0tar0 i'd say this form would net them top 6 if they keep it up
[1:16:19] Yuiieeee: Supporting KT Susge
[1:16:20] DixMX: @MonteCristo have you used an OPPO phone?
[1:16:23] mikejanderson: does feel kinda crazy that they are underdogs
[1:16:25] ProdigalChicken: @AzureCatalyst KEKW
[1:16:27] nautcholibre: KT* KY something very different lol!
[1:16:35] brandofan2: i just dont see where HLE has better players than KT
[1:16:35] Mariiann_2002: Can we start a petition to bring Rookie back to Korea and to replace zeka in HLE?
[1:16:45] brandofan2: only besides VIper but it's still Deft
[1:16:47] AzureCatalyst: I'm actually impressed with how poor HLE look after adding Peanut Doran and Delight to their core. I thought they would be good for shotcalling
[1:16:48] hiimaeia: thats huawei xdd
[1:16:54] SonsOfJarvan: Every chinese phone company
[1:16:57] AzureCatalyst: fucking SCOUT TO KT PLEASE GOD
[1:17:01] AzureCatalyst: SCOUT WHY DID YOU STAY
[1:17:03] PinnxelGRP: Isn't Scout really bad this split
[1:17:06] aoiHydra: scout is underperforming a lot rn tho
[1:17:16] dakwka: Scout hasn't recovered form world's quarters
[1:17:18] hiimaeia: man BDD's fucking trapped in hell i swear (not trusting this KT)
[1:17:18] Prepo9: @MonteCristo I'd take Ucal over Zeka at this point
[1:17:19] AzureCatalyst: Scout literally has been teasing me with the LCK return for years
[1:17:27] brandofan2: als Mark isntead of hang
[1:17:30] yanya7701: they will never come back
[1:17:35] FuHua_HoS: Can Zeka and BDD just swap teams?
[1:17:38] yanya7701: especially rookie
[1:17:38] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:17:40] thevirtuousgecko: But also Zeka didn't get astro gapped by chovy
[1:17:42] AzureCatalyst: Like every offseason Scout hints at a LCK return and he never comes back man
[1:17:47] saberaxe: I want Tarzan and TheShy to go back to the LCK as well
[1:17:48] disqovering: KT get's to worlds, Zoe becomes meta and BDD carries the team to title BASED
[1:17:48] pandagrog: @AzureCatalyst blame him for taking 3 contracts at one time
[1:17:48] thevirtuousgecko: It's a team issue
[1:17:55] Voltiate: Never underestimate the Scout international tournament  power-up
[1:17:56] mikejanderson: even haichao > zeka i fear
[1:17:59] topalphadog1: HUH
[1:17:59] Prepo9: That's what I mean, I think Ucal is VERY gettable for a team like HLE
[1:18:05] AzureCatalyst: @AzureCatalyst I fucking know man VIperDespair
[1:18:07] DixMX: HUH
[1:18:14] 1080tigpu: bad hook
[1:18:19] naocorrijo: if bdd went to hanwha, kt might as well use zinie aka rookie junior from their academy
[1:18:19] AzureCatalyst: Don't let BDD pull a Clid though
[1:18:27] AzureCatalyst: Just let him fuck consensually on the Rift
[1:18:29] brandofan2: Mark ints top esports all last year and gets to go to LNG
[1:18:33] PinnxelGRP: Just put Viper on T1
[1:18:51] DixMX: @PinnxelGRP but Gumayusi was bottom of the year Clueless
[1:18:56] disqovering: Give Kingen to DRX AND Thanatos gets a starting spot. Win-Win situation
[1:18:58] OvtForeverFall: @SonsOfJarvan tbh the US government has taken way more data from clients
[1:19:14] PinnxelGRP: @DixMX I agree with that. Guma has a great ass
[1:19:16] AzureCatalyst: @DixMX Bottom of the Year is what we call Keria's lane partner Aware
[1:19:30] AzureCatalyst: Calling Guma Bottom of the year is just peak fucking slang
[1:19:44] pandagrog: @OvtForeverFall but they use that for good things right Clueless
[1:19:48] paaaanda1: BLG's draft is just hot garbo
[1:19:53] 1080tigpu: lpl chairs so lame
[1:20:17] AzureCatalyst: May I interest you in a Seraphine Senna Botlane cristoLCS
[1:20:19] OvtForeverFall: @OvtForeverFall Clueless
[1:20:20] DixMX: LPL chairs are peak Gamer (TM)
[1:20:22] PinnxelGRP: Put Kingen on KT as well. Let my boy thanatos on DK
[1:20:22] thevirtuousgecko: Plus Guma Keria have insane insane sinergy
[1:20:25] brandofan2: the aatrox here is so grief
[1:20:31] brandofan2: you cant pick both aatrox and kindred its one or the other
[1:20:35] nautcholibre: @montecristo Cause they don’t like labels like primary engage! cristoYEAHRIGHT
[1:20:39] paaaanda1: I understand the milio into naut, thats fine, but they needed engage somewhere, put bin on ornn or something idk
[1:20:52] AzureCatalyst: Oh god
[1:20:55] wiisoka: @PinnxelGRP Thanatos is gonna end in LLA, i'm calling it now
[1:20:55] AzureCatalyst: that dash was horrific
[1:20:55] Voltiate: oh... THIS fight xD
[1:21:07] Mariiann_2002: Bin almost 1v9 this coming figh
[1:21:11] PinnxelGRP: @wiisoka C9 thanatos would be kinda hype ngl
[1:21:16] nautcholibre: this is why i play Naut
[1:21:28] AzureCatalyst: Bin trrying his heart out
[1:21:29] DixMX: lol that Aatrox heal
[1:21:30] 1080tigpu: aatrox stronk
[1:21:37] PinnxelGRP: oh my god
[1:21:39] Voltiate: CN caster popping off btw
[1:21:41] PinnxelGRP: that is so tragic for Elk
[1:21:45] naocorrijo: aatrox needs to be nerfed pls
[1:21:45] topalphadog1: Zues would of got a pentakill on attroux
[1:21:51] PinnxelGRP: holy shit 3 of them were 1 shot by Elk
[1:21:53] PinnxelGRP: thats so tragic
[1:22:17] aoiHydra: surprisingly close fight all things considered
[1:22:18] Prepo9: @MonteCristo How good is Cryin this split? I remember him being super hyped on that old eStar roster and then fell off on RNG
[1:22:32] DixMX: Even an Ornn would do so much for BLG's comp
[1:22:34] disqovering: does ON not have Q? did Elk have to flash there?
[1:22:37] AzureCatalyst: GODDAMN
[1:22:41] pandagrog: @Prepo9 he fell off? bro won msi lmao

[1:22:47] Stormserpent101: if knight didnt get insta popped therei think bincarries
[1:23:01] brandofan2: bin also healing 75% of his hp
[1:23:03] fljqpy: the new year break destroyed BLG
[1:23:05] Zay7ay: LUL
[1:23:06] AzureCatalyst: Their only engage is Ksante ulting the Aatrox into you backline KEKW
[1:23:11] 1080tigpu: what troll means in that context
[1:23:12] paaaanda1: BLG's best engage = YSKM trolling
[1:23:13] brandofan2: this fight only looked close due to bin
[1:23:19] disqovering: does ON not have Q? did Elk have to flash there??
[1:23:25] DixMX: @fljqpy they're still hungover bro, leave them alone
[1:23:36] topalphadog1: Bin had 0 kills both games KEKW
[1:23:54] Prepo9: @pandagrog Didn't live up to expectations maybe is a better way of putting it? I might be misremembering but I recall him being pretty poor on RNG overall
[1:24:00] disqovering: yeah ON had Q, why did Elk flash???
[1:24:11] fljqpy: yea the new year food and booze
[1:24:14] brandofan2: YSKM should just ult bin there
[1:24:15] aoiHydra: its crazy when you remember wink was straight up an adc player 2~ years ago
[1:24:16] brandofan2: through the wall
[1:24:19] hassanhannoun97: @disqovering neeko E
[1:24:25] pandagrog: @Prepo9 nah he was good people just shat on him cause he was the weakest player on that stacked roster
[1:24:35] Mariiann_2002: Xun walking into neeko stun is certainly a decision
[1:24:46] fljqpy: man plays karma like hes neeko LUL tryna flank
[1:25:01] topalphadog1: YSKM push aatrox toward them, and was not enough ult Keepo
[1:25:07] 1080tigpu: how elk got no kills
[1:25:13] Prepo9: @pandagrog Good to hear. I really rated him when he was on eStar
[1:25:26] PinnxelGRP: WINKUHHHHHHH LETSGO
[1:25:26] Voltiate: based Wink
[1:25:28] theancientdreamer: WINKAAAAAAAAAA
[1:25:30] AzureCatalyst: That's a LPL fistfight though
[1:25:39] UpYerArs: what are some graphic novels that you recommend for beginners @MonteCristo
[1:25:45] topalphadog1: wink really good
[1:25:49] disqovering: YSKM, what a nice guy. Helped BLG engage
[1:25:51] AzureCatalyst: Legit if LEC or LCS get into that situation the lucian probably murders everyone and the kiteback doesn't go so successfully
[1:25:52] DixMX: wink
[1:25:58] hlpark: hlpark subscribed with Prime. 
[1:26:02] aoiHydra: @AzureCatalyst uzi said this was the most exciting lpl game this split cause they were actually scrapping
[1:26:05] AzureCatalyst: Even though YSKM trolls hard, the kiteback from IG is fantastic
[1:26:05] Stormserpent101: @aoiHydra XinLiu was so dogshit they subbed in their sub adc to replace him xdding
[1:26:07] topalphadog1: LMAO
[1:26:12] aihiavg: who you got for best performing player in each region rn
[1:26:13] Mariiann_2002: Xun actually griefs so hard getting stunned and having to use ult early
[1:26:20] hassanhannoun97: @MonteCristo go back to the aatrox flash
[1:26:26] paaaanda1: maybe YSKM had bets on IG LUL
[1:26:36] Voltiate: the amount of inner-team flame if IG lost that fight...
[1:26:44] fljqpy: @Mariiann_2002 how about knight with the karma flank LUL
[1:26:45] AzureCatalyst: @aoiHydra Uzi is right but YSKM hard trolling his backline shouldn't be the be the start of your fights TBH
[1:26:45] brandofan2: really good play around leylan
[1:26:46] theancientdreamer: K'sante should be deleted from the game

[1:27:34] paaaanda1: the more you watch it, the more scuffed it gets
[1:27:34] DixMX: iG world champs incoming
[1:27:35] AzureCatalyst: This is a really good aggro juggling from iG
[1:27:36] fljqpy: imean thats just the fault of the aatrox champ, how are u allowed to continue hitting Q while being abducted
[1:27:37] hassanhannoun97: they win if bin doesnt flash there i think

[1:27:58] brandofan2: leyan*
[1:28:05] yanya7701: @hassanhannoun97 what? they were supposed to lose way harder but that flash saved it
[1:28:13] DixMX: Yordhole
[1:28:16] theancientdreamer: lpl teams are world eaters
[1:28:17] AzureCatalyst: I'm just watching this and thinking of Blaber and Fudge from the last week of play Aware
[1:28:20] disqovering: @MonteCristo can't Bin back and potentially tp full hp if they extended the fight?
[1:28:23] theancientdreamer: there is no retreat
[1:28:27] AzureCatalyst: Like those two couldn't micro themselves out of a paper bag

[1:29:18] vrozeus: He just wanna lose
[1:29:19] AzureCatalyst: That's protesting
[1:29:29] fljqpy: what was odds for IG 2-0 ?
[1:29:30] hassanhannoun97: he tried to engage with kindred ult, honestly i like the idea but aatrox too far away
[1:29:32] hehexdlul420: lpl is betting league

[1:29:49] AzureCatalyst: I CAN'T
[1:29:57] tianminervini: cough cough and that team is better than T1 =D
[1:30:01] tianminervini: ?

[1:30:03] hassanhannoun97: KEKW
[1:30:05] Respect_Dat1: but the lucian ult damage was huge there! Kappa
[1:30:11] Mykah9: fuck that reminds me of dyrus for some reason
[1:30:11] krokam1: thats a nice way to go
[1:30:11] theancientdreamer: he watched too many times the new cinematic
[1:30:13] DixMX: LPL always so innovative!
[1:30:13] brandofan2: Wink was everywhere this game
[1:30:15] cryow1zard: nobody will expect me to blastcone this wall
[1:30:16] Avisir: Xun betting on IG on first to 10 kills
[1:30:27] tianminervini: lol i know hence the cough cough
[1:30:30] a_lonely_observer: And it's going to change again when kt wins
[1:30:30] AzureCatalyst: ?
[1:30:34] AzureCatalyst: PYOSIK IS MY GHOAT
[1:30:36] unknown87644: had this exact discussion on summoning insight 😂
[1:30:37] fljqpy: KT NUMBA WAN
[1:30:39] PinnxelGRP: Can't help it, Pyosik is goated
[1:30:40] Mykah9: that it was a fluke KT won
[1:30:40] aihiavg: @montecristo who you got for best player rn
[1:30:40] AzureCatalyst: PYOSIK CLEARS CANYON EVERYTIME
[1:30:42] AzureCatalyst: EZ Clap
[1:30:43] brandofan2: i thought iG was top 6 but beating BLG i think they may be top 3/4 lpl
[1:30:44] kosstossa: never in doubt
[1:30:45] AzureCatalyst: KT WORLD CHAMPS 2024
[1:30:47] disqovering: what are we gonna say if NS wins today BASED
[1:30:49] hansajnilohk: KT can't win, it's illegal
[1:30:50] hiimaeia: Ez, Beryl want funds for Wuthering Waves
[1:30:50] NutellaHappens: Don't say that there's no shot they win, right ??
[1:30:51] vrozeus: Arent u the KT hater?
[1:30:52] hazygreys: if you gonna come in and bag on monte at least drop a prime on him
[1:30:54] Saucy____Boy: Would you actually rank T1 over BLG after this or do you think it’s just a fluke?
[1:30:57] tianminervini: the only thing that i will say is im going to be making MOOOONEEEYYYY
[1:31:00] nautcholibre: what! you make object choices based on facts and not how you feel how can I trust the power rankings @montecristo
[1:31:04] S1lentSymphony: Honestly, I just want good games out of it.
[1:31:05] paaaanda1: Zeus better than Keria?
[1:31:09] DixMX: no bro, Faker is still the best player Kappa
[1:31:09] Stormserpent101: second best player of all time Beryl is going to run a clinic on T1
[1:31:11] hassanhannoun97: BB floors Zeus
[1:31:14] dakwka: are the power rankings weekly?
[1:31:17] violincake: HLE wins today BASED
[1:31:18] PinnxelGRP: Zeus is so boring tho he just picks aatrox every game ResidentSleeper
[1:31:18] Mykah9: When I visit korea would i be able to see the T-1 building?
[1:31:20] lost_t1me: elk absolutely 0 dmg with this build
[1:31:21] meIIerr: chinese gameplay is a different breed
[1:31:28] a_lonely_observer: Beryl is t1s father
[1:31:28] itzgboi: @montecristo do you think theres a world where we have to live with 3x world champion Beryl😭
[1:31:42] paaaanda1: Keria is my goat
[1:32:04] AzureCatalyst: @itzgboi Well we live in 3x world champ Bengi World. So we can definitely get the Triple Champ Beryl with 3 different Orgs
[1:32:06] fljqpy: beryl cant win a 3rd worlds with same teammates
[1:32:08] PinnxelGRP: Lol BLG sucks, just disqualify them from MSI NAILS
[1:32:16] disqovering: question: do you check minor regions when it comes to msi and the teams that go? if yes would you do it on stream?
[1:32:16] AzureCatalyst: If Beryl actually wins this year I'm done with pro league
[1:32:18] a_lonely_observer: Beryl is already the second greatest player of all time since he won 2 times without faker
[1:32:23] Respect_Dat1: graves on the other hand is fed af
[1:32:24] theancientdreamer: is the betting stuff only available for the US?
[1:32:25] dakwka: another blue steal KEKW
[1:32:26] brandofan2: i think LPL has the top junglers this year
[1:32:27] fljqpy: he has to go to a different org with different teammates
[1:32:31] AzureCatalyst: JDG BEGS TO DIFFER
[1:32:35] cryow1zard: beryl win worlds again is scripted
[1:32:41] aoiHydra: superteam jdg lost to IG last year, it happens
[1:32:41] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:32:42] AzureCatalyst: JDG ONLY LOST TO WORLD FINALIST WBG during their Run
[1:32:43] Avaresse: rng cryin
[1:32:45] Dreath1: I just think this BLG squad can't match peak JDG from last year
[1:32:47] brandofan2: are you not excited for KDF against BRO 2 times ina row
[1:32:49] aihiavg: do you think lck is a better region right now
[1:32:51] lorekage: lck looks too strong so I think lck wins it this year too
[1:32:52] lost_t1me: but why cant he just go kraken/navori vs 4 low range champs
[1:32:53] nautcholibre: Who is KT jungle? That game seems really good! cristoPLEB
[1:32:53] dakwka: JDG with Kanavi have always been BLG's father
[1:32:54] Stormserpent101: Beryl is my goat support i will not be convinced otherwise
[1:32:55] TastyAMG: LPL is a stronger league so they drop games/series to lower ranked teams more often :D
[1:33:02] yanya7701: how is Leyan good? Did he improve a lot this year?
[1:33:19] PinnxelGRP: C9 clears BLG I fear
[1:33:27] fljqpy: EWWWW
[1:33:29] kittenpizza: xun match fixing engage
[1:33:31] DixMX: god damn
[1:33:35] Voltiate: and there's the neeko punish
[1:33:43] MoonFall24: hows cryin having a resurrection all of the sudden?
[1:33:51] fljqpy: just run out of the ult why not KEKW
[1:33:52] a_lonely_observer: If beryl wins worlds this year he is a better player than faker because he won 3 worlds without having faker on his team
[1:33:55] PinnxelGRP: Is that the annie one trick Pog
[1:33:56] captainkrajick: @MoonFall24 he's always been good on engage wdym
[1:33:57] AzureCatalyst: Cryin has been solid since the Neeko and Annie meta
[1:33:58] paaaanda1: @MoonFall24 because he's playin neeko
[1:34:03] brandofan2: Leyan was stuck on RA thats why no one knew he was this good
[1:34:05] Mariiann_2002: Crazy what ACTUAL engage can achieve huh
[1:34:06] AzureCatalyst: Cryin my Annie OTP
[1:34:07] KingTyonidas: baron buffed cannon range is my still the most annoying little thing to me inconvenienced on both ends
[1:34:08] captainkrajick: @MoonFall24 +Taliyah
[1:34:27] PinnxelGRP: Is TF permabanned against Cryin btw, that was like the one champ he was insane on during 2021 LUL
[1:34:28] MoonFall24: @MoonFall24 yeah bro i saw his annie on worlds, no
[1:34:29] KingTyonidas: is still *
[1:34:30] paaaanda1: this game is the definition of what happens when engage meets no engage
[1:34:32] DixMX: @AzureCatalyst didn't know Cryin likes little girls Aware
[1:34:35] Avaresse: put some respec on cryin
[1:34:40] fljqpy: hovered ornn just to pick aatrox for no reason
[1:34:40] aoiHydra: we'll get to see some better kindred gameplay in the fpx series Pog
[1:34:42] AntiquusTonitrus_3: so milo lucain is a bait then @MonteCristo
[1:34:46] a_lonely_observer: What I like about cryin is that he doesn't play like a bitch
[1:34:49] endarc1251: used LFN code to order factor and it gets here next week. never used a service like this and I’m kinda hyped for it
[1:34:54] AzureCatalyst: LNG vs FPX is goign to be a depression game isn't it
[1:34:57] yanya7701: this BLG comp is god awful, literally 0 range
[1:35:02] rfarleydude97: chat which is better hellofresh or factor?
[1:35:02] brandofan2: JG/toplane picks were bad
[1:35:03] AzureCatalyst: I have no idea how Scout and Weiwei fell so far off
[1:35:09] brandofan2: kindred counterpick and aatrox for no reason
[1:35:10] ax_ell: Karma isn't the pick for teams like BLG GENG I believe, putting these mids on supportive mids ain't it
[1:35:13] topalphadog1: I like lucian+nami more
[1:35:14] PinnxelGRP: BLG have one glaring weakness, they have no Koreans and thus they suck Kappa
[1:35:15] captainkrajick: Cryin is known most for his TF, but TF is too broken in 3 roles cuz Riot
[1:35:19] Respect_Dat1: @AntiquusTonitrus_3 milio/lucian only works on early game snowball... the moment u lose, it's over
[1:35:22] AzureCatalyst: How did LNG turn into this hot garbage Sadge
[1:35:27] a_lonely_observer: Lucian is a shit pick let's be honest, it's like 20% winrate in lcs and lec
[1:35:42] fljqpy: in the shit leagues yea
[1:35:46] pandagrog: @AzureCatalyst milkyway is just him
[1:35:48] captainkrajick: @a_lonely_observer and it's a 70% wr in LCK,LPL
[1:35:50] AzureCatalyst: @a_lonely_observer Using LEC and LCS as a judge of high execution picks like Lucian is a trap
[1:35:50] Respect_Dat1: @a_lonely_observer yeah but the meta in lcs/lec isn't early game snowball... it's late game scaling
[1:36:00] captainkrajick: @AzureCatalyst LNG didn't. The Milkman is just legit
[1:36:06] kittenpizza: Thinking about ordering factor to lose weight . I overate when I order out .
[1:36:08] Mariiann_2002: Just run maokai top at this point, champ is op anyway
[1:36:10] topalphadog1: he should of played TF Top Keepo
[1:36:10] AzureCatalyst: Legit Caitlyn is like terrible in the west but god tier in LPL and LCK punish so hard with cait lux lanes
[1:36:11] brandofan2: yeah i don't think Bin is playing malphite
[1:36:16] TastyAMG: Lucian is OP the west just sucks xdd
[1:36:22] NutellaHappens: # Make malachite great again
[1:36:27] AzureCatalyst: aLRIGHT
[1:36:27] AntiquusTonitrus_3: @Respect_Dat1 i know but in pro play cant the other team kinda stall for like 5min more allowing them to get even in items
[1:36:28] captainkrajick: Sadge
[1:36:28] NutellaHappens: Malaphite*
[1:36:30] AzureCatalyst: Have a good gym day
[1:36:33] paaaanda1: LUL
[1:36:34] lost_t1me: milio is insanely good with kindred and lucian but you cant be that behind by 15 min
[1:36:34] rfarleydude97: hellofresh or factor? @MonteCristo
[1:36:38] Fluffieface: ty for strem
[1:36:38] DixMX: thanks for the bangers Monte
[1:36:39] hiimaeia: LUL
[1:36:40] saberaxe: get a good pump then
[1:36:40] captainkrajick: I have to watch Valorant now?
[1:36:41] Dreath1: scout got railed by zeka and faker consecutively and just gave up
[1:36:42] ax_ell: LUL
[1:36:42] KingTyonidas: LUL
[1:36:44] AzureCatalyst: Good night sweet prince (LNG) We will remember you for your beautiful maokai games last year
[1:36:44] captainkrajick: Dear God Aware
[1:36:48] a_lonely_observer: We want to see you want your fraud team lose though @montecristo
[1:36:48] OvtForeverFall: TES-WBG?
[1:36:50] nautcholibre: @montecristo getting his gains just like me !! get it son!!

[1:36:55] 1080tigpu: lift hard bro
[1:36:56] MoonFall24: is IG legit or was BLG too cocky?
[1:37:02] san2194: are you doing muay thai in korea?
[1:37:05] rfarleydude97: factor looks like its prepared which prob fits me best haha
[1:37:07] yanya7701: LNG lost to whom?
[1:37:15] nautcholibre: ohh fun!!
[1:37:16] rfarleydude97: but wanted to ask anyways just to see, ill try it out with the code
[1:37:16] AzureCatalyst: LNG got rolled by FPX
[1:37:16] Respect_Dat1: @Respect_Dat1 if the team with lucian/milio is good at pressing the advantage, the other team won't even be able to stall
[1:37:30] yanya7701: @AzureCatalyst whats FPX's roster
[1:37:31] saberaxe: I like how IG has produced alot of great jglers
[1:37:32] a_lonely_observer: 5 games of jungle gap last night
[1:37:36] AzureCatalyst: @yanya7701 No idea sorry
[1:37:36] fljqpy: my goat deokdam with the MVPs Kappa
[1:37:38] PinnxelGRP: T1 vs KT PepeLaugh
[1:37:40] Respect_Dat1: @Respect_Dat1 jungle will set up a tent in bot lane
[1:37:41] AntiquusTonitrus_3: @Respect_Dat1 but looks like most team beside t1 cant do that
[1:37:42] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/

[1:37:53] AzureCatalyst: Surely T1 doesn't get cleared by Pyosik PepeLaugh
[1:37:54] fistigons25: yeah you didn’t do TES vs WBG before
[1:37:56] aoiHydra: JDG BLG is such a banger
