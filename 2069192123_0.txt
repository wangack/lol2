[3:48:24] KaratelBanderivskyi: Nasus deserved perma for inting
[3:48:45] Schuhbart: what is the point of scripting on senna and then building locket and frozen heart
[3:48:48] polyTuff: does anyone else get those whispers on twitch all in chinese
[3:48:58] bladetrinity16: i did the other day, i just reported and blocked it

[3:50:58] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[3:51:02] Schuhbart: you can tell hes scripting cause he instantly clicks at a 90 degree angle to the illaoi e
[3:51:05] polyTuff: i love your sona plays Lovegers
[3:51:07] Schuhbart: and then he walks back forward
[3:51:11] Lazynameross: in game it would look weird cuz she walked into edge of it'
[3:51:30] mushymoss: maybe check when she walked back into nunu?
[3:51:31] Schuhbart: you will see it if you slow it down and look closely at his movement in reaction to the illaoi e
[3:51:49] ThomasTheTwink: stuntDetective
[3:52:03] GATREUS98: low level account wouldnt be surprised if it was scripts
[3:52:04] polyTuff: Susge

[3:52:57] polyTuff: Sadge
[3:53:16] ThomasTheTwink: didnt she also keep dodging back into the nunu ult
[3:53:17] Lazynameross: new patch should have it

[3:54:12] bladetrinity16: check when she died near mid
[3:54:15] bladetrinity16: to nunu
[3:54:27] GATREUS98: i see senna scripts mainly for spacing and dodging. its very oppressive
[3:55:05] mondayafternoon: it was obvious scripts with first dodge on ur QQ, that was a sub 100ms response lol
[3:55:10] bladetrinity16: okay that is kinda sus
[3:55:18] Apostolique: Wouldn't it try to dodge the snowball too?
[3:55:26] la_brujito: she was going like just out of range too
[3:55:37] foxinblack_: she wanted to dodge the snowball there
[3:55:41] Lazynameross: if not scripting id think she failed to dodge your fear
[3:55:43] foxinblack_: you cant outrun it
[3:55:51] polyTuff: maybe scared of your fear
