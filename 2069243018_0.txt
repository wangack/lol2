[0:35:15] ElusiveFRZ: everyone on your team is down at least 2 levels compared to karma/hect oo
[0:36:05] PowrOfFriendship_: No dps, no teamfight or siege threat, and burst damage that's worse than basically every bot lane mage
[0:36:55] teziqdki: and the game is unplayable for him if they pick like 50% of the champs
[0:37:05] teziqdki: imagine playing jhin with hecarim in the game
[0:37:30] PowrOfFriendship_: He is my go to ban every game, not because I can't deal with him, but because I can't stand playing with him

[1:10:52] Gargantix: @itsmaffs okay this isn't the army, there is no part you needed to play rofl. it's nice of you, but subbing is never necessary, y'know? sometimes people just can't, pretty sure medic respects that xP - maybe call out people with unused prime subs
[1:11:09] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[1:11:26] itsmaffs: My apologies, it was fully a joke

[1:47:42] Anders15: huh, mine says 45k wtf
[1:47:59] crispytain: Sadge lck youtube has 30k too tho
[1:48:06] NezzEUW: I'm not sure how much the physical tickets contribute, but they literally sold out instantly for Spring split
[1:48:12] ElusiveFRZ: well, given that the stream went down on finals last week and the only way to watch the fights was caedral.... :/ maybe
[1:48:17] Anders15: oh, after I refreshed twitch it said 30k. Mby it was 45k when I entered medic stream
[1:48:25] NezzEUW: 15 euros I believe but yeah still not much
[1:49:01] mohtwitchtv: That tp sucked guy, I love you

[1:49:22] remixlol1: Thats the wrong song, thats not the original :(
[1:49:27] crispytain: 'stryker fell' is such a hard line
[1:49:41] remixlol1: okok
[1:49:44] ElusiveFRZ: was Depa ok afterwards?
[1:50:10] Bladesdemise: MEDIIIIIIIC
[1:50:13] Anders15: "that tp sucked" has just become an iconic line that several casters use. Semi like, "faker, what was that"
[1:50:25] Bladesdemise: wait what rank is he_
[1:50:34] Bladesdemise: sorry if theres a command
[1:50:38] NezzEUW: Diamond 1 i think
[1:50:40] lsiebenschlaferl: Hello everyone :) Using my lunch break to further my league education :D
[1:50:43] Bladesdemise: ooo
[1:50:49] Bladesdemise: damn medic is good
[1:50:49] NezzEUW: ah D2
[1:51:01] Bladesdemise: ohhhh
[1:51:02] Sandrian: @remixlol1 are you back grandmaster yet? Kappa
[1:51:06] mohtwitchtv: Does he cast while on grey screen?
[1:51:34] remixlol1: @Sandrian Yep, in fact close to Challenger
[1:51:52] Sandrian: Ooh nice
[1:51:55] lsiebenschlaferl: @remixlol1 congrats!
[1:51:59] Anders15: not to brag, but I ALMOST made diamond one season!
[1:52:00] Sandrian: Then Medic can't mock you anymore haha
[1:52:03] remixlol1: Why do you think I duoq with medic again
[1:52:07] remixlol1: Now that im gm he cant flame anymore
[1:52:47] remixlol1: Yes thats the real song, good
[1:52:49] Bladesdemise: i just got masters with aatrox on euw, emerald was a journey i never wanne go through again
[1:53:07] NezzEUW: @Bladesdemise Emerald was suffering big true
[1:53:18] NezzEUW: Did like 60 games getting out of emerald, then 20 games getting to D2
[1:53:27] Bladesdemise: @NezzEUW exactly!
[1:53:48] Bladesdemise: i knew it couldnt just have been me when bobquin, the lb main was hardstuck emerald aswell
[1:54:06] NezzEUW: There is something cursed about it for sure
[1:54:08] Anders15: I stopped playing ranked after emerald was introduced. I already had a hard time getting diamond, after emerald, it seemed impossible xd
[1:54:09] crispytain: *2 ap threats if you build like a chad
[1:54:39] Baltazars_father: did not know that about australia
[1:54:52] LUCYXZ1337: this rock rap genre died prematurely
[1:54:56] LUCYXZ1337: and i kinda liked it
[1:54:58] Edthusiasm98: giga chad Bard
[1:55:10] Bladesdemise: @Anders15 honestly understandable
[1:55:33] Bladesdemise: before emerald i got to diamond rather easily on off roles, now i reach emerald and i nose dive in wr
[1:56:11] Anders15: I think its understandable in some aspects, but for others, introducing that rank causes too many problems :b
[1:57:04] NezzEUW: The real issue is smurfs and accesibility of botted lvl 30 accounts
[1:57:08] Bladesdemise: @Anders15 that's true, its understandable for splitting that high plat/low diamond and low plat but made climbing harder
[1:57:16] Bladesdemise: @NezzEUW thats very true
[1:57:17] NezzEUW: The issue for me atleast in Emerald was having excessive amount of lvl 30 accounts which just didn't care
[1:57:21] Anders15: @Bladesdemise yea
[1:57:38] Bladesdemise: oh i got prime
[1:57:41] Bladesdemise: Bladesdemise subscribed with Prime. 
[1:58:26] Anders15: you need to buy premium or something on amazon to have a prime subscription available, correct?
[1:58:32] Bladesdemise: @NezzEUW yeah i felt attracted to champions that didnt need to rely on teammates as much because of that, which is why i started playing a lot of aatrox
[1:59:19] zjhammer: how does doran start work as surport?
[1:59:48] Anders15: oh, amazon prime is a streaming service apparently xd I sorta just thought it gave like, discounts when buying at amazon or something xd
[2:00:52] zjhammer: Thanks :)
[2:01:34] Anders15: XD
[2:01:44] PUNisheart: medic noooo
[2:02:09] StreamElements: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.

[2:06:30] Anders15: true
[2:06:48] Anders15: but qiyana is hard with low cd dash :)
[2:07:19] Anders15: bye bye, zyra

[2:13:15] Anders15: zyra must be annoyed by these bard r.. always caught at the edge of them
[2:13:22] Anders15: so close to dodging every time
[2:13:44] Bladesdemise: when facing a good bard i just cant play the game
[2:13:48] Bladesdemise: he's so oppressive
[2:14:13] Anders15: that's the good thing about only playing fun modes. Bard aint that good in them
[2:14:44] mistychevre: nerfed soon
[2:14:57] Anders15: remember when I said bard 1v1'ed qiyana? :D
[2:15:03] RealGuldborg: Hello please stop abusing unethical champions like Bard
[2:15:38] Anders15: @RealGuldborg oh, you would too, if you could, and you know it! :)
[2:15:46] mistychevre: do you have any connection with balance team? The ksante buff makes no sense
[2:15:57] preddypred: All that Tren kekw
[2:16:02] Sandrian: can always ask Krepo for some pointers, his bard is disgusting lol, just to dominate this week
[2:16:08] Kacnea: yea they are removing the q slow during his ult
[2:16:18] Kacnea: and slowing the e travel speed?
[2:16:25] mistychevre: ah mb
[2:16:48] Anders15: but does q slow in ult do much dmg to him or no? To me, it sorta feels like he just one shots me after r anyways
[2:17:19] Kacnea: if he q's he has to stand still for a bit
[2:17:28] Kacnea: so wihtout the slow if you are chasing someone you are losing distance
[2:17:31] kasetta: no penta Sadge
[2:17:31] Anders15: he sorta seems like a gnar that can decide when he wants mega gnar
[2:17:34] Kacnea: by q'ing
[2:17:40] kasetta: gg
[2:17:47] Bladesdemise: gege
[2:18:08] mistychevre: spring split  will be the real launch of the season, it feels so much like a preseason this wintersplit
[2:18:21] johnsaxonofleague: I get plus 16 after ruining my accounts MMR
[2:19:10] Bladesdemise: MMR is so weird now
[2:19:34] mistychevre: they changed mmr balance
[2:19:37] Bladesdemise: i get +38 -15 then lose a couple of games and goes down to 27
[2:20:12] Anders15: How do you ruin your mmr? Win a lot and then lose a lot? Like, what decides it?
[2:20:15] mistychevre: to climb from emerald you need to adjust mmr
[2:21:01] mistychevre: they said they increased the elo to reach diamond so its normal if you drop from 30 Lp gain to 20 Lp gain
[2:21:29] Anders15: 30 lp gain?? :o 22 used to be A LOT
[2:21:43] mistychevre: i did a +40
[2:22:00] mistychevre: now in emerald i do +30
[2:22:49] Bladesdemise: wait what server does medic play on? just wondering!
[2:23:01] PowrOfFriendship_: Is this an unlocked account?

[2:24:18] PowrOfFriendship_: Do you have a favourite skin?
[2:24:19] xiaogamer_: isit normal to have fwbs?
[2:24:24] mistychevre: yeah it does mental dmg
[2:24:27] mistychevre: when you spam emote
