[2:26:06] Pitju99: if it's about the same just never build the item
[2:26:57] Pitju99: lord doms will do way less against anyone that isn't full build tank
[2:27:00] Pitju99: and you lose defences
[2:27:07] breznich: did u ever look storm gate i think u 'll like it
[2:28:54] Pitju99: by the time you'd stack it up 1v1 they're dead
