[1:50:14] Falcnation: blitz should've flash hooked
[1:50:36] Floeey_: well you need to make the q sound now in real life too
[1:51:00] arthalie: Man I miss oddone playing league. I love him but I couldn't do the jrpg's that late at night

[1:59:28] GhostxxHorse: zoning snowball
[2:00:06] eliotxshadowfrost21: pyke just ks'd the fuck outta that
[2:01:10] getsometalentloser: nunu looks fun i used to play old nunu
[2:01:17] getsometalentloser: that nunu was fun af
[2:01:41] s9jglsuperstar: old nunu with red smite
[2:01:50] Falcnation: my first champ back in s2 was nunu bot lane. not support, bot lane xd
[2:01:50] Floeey_: old nunu just looked so goofy thats what made him even funnier
[2:01:52] getsometalentloser: bro old nunu just walking into enemy jungle
[2:02:00] getsometalentloser: consuming there buff
[2:02:08] getsometalentloser: and walking out cause ur where to tanky
[2:02:12] getsometalentloser: and they couldn’t do shit
[2:02:35] getsometalentloser: cosmic drive
[2:02:40] getsometalentloser: hp and mobility
[2:03:44] GhostxxHorse: someone fed the kassadin
[2:03:55] pepego2: always so draining seeing your lanes be 2-3 lvls behind
[2:04:15] arthalie: Old nunu in top lane was so funny
[2:05:27] iiNumb3rz: I lost 125 lp yesterday. Everything is fine.
[2:06:12] pepego2: @iiNumb3rz please if you have any mental advice for when that shit happens im all hears
[2:06:19] pepego2: ears
[2:06:25] iiNumb3rz: Keep chat muted. Take breaks. Go next.
[2:06:38] iiNumb3rz: Figure out what you can do better instead of flame your team.
[2:07:20] arthalie: Maybe imperial mandate? AP health and utility
[2:08:01] iiNumb3rz: Do you have any tips for late game lee sin? I usually get 3-5 kills pre 10 mins but when the low ell aram ensues I struggle. I can't really insec because I'm old and my brain can't handle that.
[2:08:10] getsometalentloser: @santorin  told us hybrid
[2:08:16] Facyman: WE WINDOWS
[2:08:16] iiNumb3rz: Well I can kind of do it. Not perfect.
[2:08:17] arthalie: Otherwise abyssal mask?
[2:09:09] iiNumb3rz: I would respect the hell out of it. My dude is usually the guy who did the feeding.
[2:09:27] auri_sariel: that Kassadin had no idea wtf is going on why he is slow KEKW
[2:09:53] arthalie: Until tomorrow id ping to run from ksante too
[2:10:11] auri_sariel: @arthalie whats important is, AHRI BUFFS YAAAAAAAAS
[2:10:28] iiNumb3rz: Just build lich bane. Seems to work on every ap champ lol
[2:10:30] arthalie: I just don't think the armor is worth with kassadin being this fed
[2:10:55] Zeiik101: K'Sante isn't even really being nerfed that hard. There's a mix of buffs/nerfs
[2:11:12] Zeiik101: Not sure much will change lol
[2:11:18] arthalie: His all our is getting gutted which is the biggest problem
[2:11:25] auri_sariel: @Zeiik101 they add to his sustain but make his kill potential lower, thats why  he wont be that scary anymore
[2:11:45] iiNumb3rz: I wonder how many carriers dragons you've killed.
[2:11:47] Zeiik101: Ah I see. I only saw part of it then
[2:11:50] iiNumb3rz: Career*
[2:11:54] Kai0Shin05: AlienPls3 AlienPls3 AlienPls3
[2:12:19] Kai0Shin05: how to outsmite nunu?
[2:12:32] iiNumb3rz: Kill them first lol
[2:12:57] auri_sariel: @Zeiik101 basically he is getting stronger as a tank with the changes, but no longer will be such a beast when he goes all out
[2:13:17] getsometalentloser: the ksante changes are overall a nerf
[2:13:23] auri_sariel: yep
[2:13:23] arthalie: In a perfect world riot would accept that Ksante as a tank just won't be balanceable. I want them to accept he's s fighter and give him damage ratios
[2:13:25] getsometalentloser: anyone who looks at it as a buff
[2:13:29] getsometalentloser: is actually cluelesss
[2:15:07] Toften69: 3 MS the dream xD
[2:15:52] ItsNefar: Hey sant, is it viable  cho jungle¿?
[2:16:12] 777raw777: hwei kinda ass vs tanky champs
[2:16:51] ChicoLoLxD: Can you be a good pro jungler but a bad solo q jungler because the two play so differently
[2:17:03] nwa4lifeTV: cho jg used to be op
[2:17:12] ChicoLoLxD: I.e. carry jungling vs tank jungling
[2:17:13] arthalie: Rammie
[2:17:18] Floeey_: Gragas
[2:17:21] arthalie: The amordillo calls
[2:17:42] RifleEU: yo mr sant i won the kha against ivern game serpants fang came in clutch
[2:18:05] Social_Phobia: OOOOH kindred!
[2:18:08] jimbob_ywert: what syndra skin should I get
[2:18:28] RifleEU: i enjoy watching kindred
[2:18:31] getsometalentloser: @rifleeu  i remeber the number 1 ivern. has ptsd of a Karthus selling his shadow flame for serpents fang and it won the gsme
[2:18:41] Social_Phobia: ive never seen kindred on any stream yet
[2:18:48] Social_Phobia: but id love to pick her up
[2:18:51] getsometalentloser: Cause serpent fang works on all dmg types
[2:18:53] RifleEU: @getsometalentloser LMAO thats funny af
[2:18:53] jimbob_ywert: Conq is good on kindred
[2:19:12] Social_Phobia: a bit different to my onetrick though
[2:19:17] RifleEU: i actually watched a video by a very awesome kindred otp explaining his mark maneuvring and its so fun
[2:19:41] RifleEU: theres a very nice chall jungle main that interviews otps for a few hours
[2:20:00] Social_Phobia: wanna send me the link in dm? please
[2:20:07] Rodacon: Is it sometimes a bait for an enemy to kill the mark camps (e.g. if they give up something on the other side of the map) or is it always good to kill them?
[2:20:29] ChicoLoLxD: why do u get more value from conqueror in a more passive game vs lethal tempo
[2:20:33] RifleEU: yeah! going to the marks before they spawn when u do good jungle tracks
[2:20:48] Alveneb: marks on kindred are literally dragon stack values
[2:20:52] Alveneb: for syhvanna
[2:21:06] Alveneb: but tripled
[2:21:10] RifleEU: @Santorin do you use the f keys to mark midfights?
[2:21:16] Rodacon: Wow, her base range is so low.
[2:21:23] Rodacon: Although I get that's the whole idea
[2:21:31] Alveneb: Pog leash
[2:21:46] arthalie: Each mark is worth about a longsword, and the breakpoints are like 1200 gold in stats when you hit them
[2:22:37] RifleEU: did you try the kindred clear when u skip raptors and do it last?
[2:23:07] arthalie: It's why I'm surprised funnel kindred never became meta, being able to 2v1  the enemy jg with a braum/tactic for camps is unplayable for the enemy jg
[2:23:23] Gambit2012: you got the kill whats the problem?
[2:23:38] RifleEU: @Gambit2012 didnt get mark
[2:24:11] Gambit2012: I mean I guess I don't understand how marks work then but how does that not get him mark?
[2:24:24] getsometalentloser: cause when u change marks it’s not instant
[2:24:29] getsometalentloser: there’s a delay
[2:24:31] Gambit2012: ah it was cooking
[2:24:34] Tristiiano: @Santorin any tips for kindred skill usage?
[2:25:05] getsometalentloser: @santorin  the prestige kindred is out soon
[2:25:20] ChicoLoLxD: max w or e 2nd?
[2:26:30] Gambit2012: and then flashed
[2:26:56] Whitizi: now we just pretend neeko really is a minion
[2:27:32] Gambit2012: 7/1 lul
[2:27:36] nwa4lifeTV: SourPls
[2:27:46] Whitizi: wait kalista instantly cleansed that
[2:27:48] RifleEU: wait reptile reached challenger impressive
[2:27:52] Whitizi: he on 2 ping wtf
[2:27:53] getsometalentloser: u knew ur where in for a bad time
[2:27:59] getsometalentloser: when ur support picks morgana
[2:28:05] getsometalentloser: that champ is so god awful
[2:28:23] Whitizi: getsometalentloser morg is broken if you just know how to black shield
[2:29:15] getsometalentloser: I’d rather other supports she super bad
[2:29:35] arthalie: Think we are visenna bot lane as a counter if zero comes back into the meta?
[2:29:54] Whitizi: farm marks poggies
[2:29:59] arthalie: God I hate autocorrect it's the worst lmfao
[2:30:53] nwa4lifeTV: such dps
[2:31:06] Whitizi: yum yum yum free gold
[2:31:48] PPenjoyer69: took 2 turret shots sadge
[2:32:05] Rodacon: LUL
[2:32:05] RifleEU: LOL
[2:32:06] BrainCurry: KEKW
[2:32:06] s9jglsuperstar: anything for karl marx 💯
[2:32:08] nwa4lifeTV: do it 4 the mark
[2:32:10] pepego2: looking like a 15 angle ngl
[2:32:16] OPDonQuixoteTFT: Your ult healed it :D
[2:32:43] RifleEU: smart by ornn to rush anathemas
[2:32:49] Alveneb: Jammies
[2:33:25] Alveneb: bro literally ulted LB clone icant
[2:33:27] auri_sariel: he has a skin on the smolder too
[2:33:43] OPDonQuixoteTFT: morgana is an absolut useless champ :D 37 percent winrate in challenger for a reason
[2:33:57] auri_sariel: @OPDonQuixoteTFT dont shit talk Broxahs favorite :C
[2:34:01] arthalie: Somewhere over the 🌈*we have a mid laner*🌈
[2:34:05] pepego2: peepoSit peepoSit
[2:34:47] GhostxxHorse: people just don't know how to get smolder stacks well enough to play it and have any use
[2:35:02] auri_sariel: LOL
[2:35:03] PPenjoyer69: he is no longer 0/5/0
[2:35:08] Hixleys: bad timing to open the stream
[2:35:11] auri_sariel: KEKL
[2:35:17] RifleEU: should i try learning kayn?
[2:35:29] bravepork: @hixleys?
[2:35:35] Zeiik101: I hate illaoi lol
[2:35:36] auri_sariel: i bet its the smolder
[2:35:59] OPDonQuixoteTFT: smolrder and ornn scale good at least
[2:36:20] arthalie: We're playing for 225 stack smolder now lol
[2:36:39] Whitizi: and shes laughing
[2:36:51] Whitizi: morg is actually a griefer
[2:36:54] Whitizi: SHE SHIELDS HERSELF
[2:36:56] Whitizi: LMFAOOOOOO
[2:37:12] RayeAerinae: you just go next mentally and ride it out
[2:37:32] Whitizi: @Santorin theres a bot/spammer in chat DMing people. belinda_julias can you or a mod ban pls
[2:38:01] nwa4lifeTV: LUL the range
[2:39:13] auri_sariel: KEKW

[2:39:53] Zeiik101: I got a DM too but from a different name
[2:40:01] auri_sariel: i didnt received any message from that person so maybe that person was from a different stream
[2:40:03] Zeiik101: No link though
[2:40:04] Whitizi: oh so maybe its just bot attack in general
[2:40:30] Social_Phobia: thats what usually happens if i pick kindred xD
[2:40:31] ronswainson: embrace the grief and only hunt marks rest of game
[2:40:42] auri_sariel: anything? if i convince ur teammates you will get me a new pc? @Santorin
[2:41:38] Jakmo: high stack Kindred win conn? They believe in you
[2:42:45] Whitizi: maybe only buy ornn upgrade items and you can be raid boss
[2:42:46] OPDonQuixoteTFT: the moment kalista showed on your screen u went from 5-1 to 6-8 WutFace
[2:42:46] Whitizi: LUL
[2:42:56] Alveneb: if smolder had full stacks rn it would be a penta
[2:42:56] ChicoLoLxD: I’m confused why u didn’t get the first stack on the 1st kill against ilaoi
[2:42:57] Alveneb: on execute
[2:43:05] auri_sariel: believe it or not santorini but i think you can win XD
[2:43:08] RifleEU: atleast it was a good fight

[2:48:58] arthalie: Pyosik played it in alacK this week lol
[2:49:02] arthalie: LCK
[2:49:13] Floeey_: Born before 2k means we could game league season 1
[2:49:19] Rodacon: Parks and Rec is fantastic but you absolutely HAVE to get to season 2 to see how good it is. Season 1 is really bad compared to the rest of the show.
[2:49:43] solidussovis: You feeling OK Santo? You didn't ban Annie. Something change.
[2:49:43] RifleEU: i always ban senna so my own team wont pick it lol
[2:50:04] Floeey_: LOL bro we live the same i started season 2 too
[2:50:06] Rodacon: I switched from Starcraft 2 to League in S2
[2:50:16] solidussovis: Makes sense

[2:50:30] Rodacon: back when League started wiping the floor with CS2 viewership-wise
[2:50:31] RifleEU: nobody in mid dia know how to play it its a serious handycap
[2:50:33] Floeey_: i played a hell lot wow and metin2 back in the day before league
[2:50:37] Rodacon: *SC2
[2:50:39] pawyYE: whens the last time u played trundle jg?
[2:51:10] alabamahammer02: Is /deafen troll or no?
[2:51:12] Floeey_: oh and maplestory
[2:51:19] arthalie: I really like Viego rumble 2v2, so much burst
[2:51:24] Rodacon: It was 10-20k when that was impressinve, then League started hitting 100-200k
[2:51:57] RifleEU: i hate that everytime someone dies 1v1 i get the red ping on myself
[2:52:00] ntmadeit: hello hello how we doin

[2:53:36] Levo311: is friggin yuumi
[2:53:40] Alveneb: I think season 3-7 was the peak for viewership
[2:53:41] arthalie: The same mid twice is a coincidence, three times is a stream sniper if we get him again
[2:53:43] Alveneb: faker-san
[2:54:06] Rodacon: You used to hear the League crowds on the SC2 streams at things like MLG and you'd see elitist comments in the SC2 channels' chat from people in denial about how popular League was LUL
[2:54:43] ronswainson: I was one of those ppl until S5...
[2:55:37] Alveneb: KEKW
[2:55:40] assoun24: LOL
[2:55:46] assoun24: i cant play him either
[2:55:48] nwa4lifeTV: he flashed ur 3rd q sadly

[2:56:31] solidussovis: NA tax is real
[2:56:37] Alveneb: on my server that guy would've insta run it down
[2:56:45] Jakmo: all of his laners will still forget he ganked in a few minutes
[2:56:45] assoun24: do non NA jung actually not tax??
[2:57:23] assoun24: i always tax (from na)
[2:57:32] arthalie: He's gotta be a str am sniper there's no way this guy plays like this normally
[2:57:37] solidussovis: I tax if I don't get a kill or assist. Laner is paying me for my time one way or another
[2:58:13] assoun24: hes not human
[2:58:18] Gambit2012: run to him and not towards wraiths? idk
[2:58:32] Social_Phobia: i very much dislike taking waves, bcs then the enemy knows where i am and eve's threat is gone xD
[2:58:44] lubemila: santorinFP
[2:58:45] solidussovis: @Gambit2012 They should have been moving before he got out of river

[3:00:18] assoun24: big big big
[3:00:23] HarliiQuiinn: Amen
[3:00:43] assoun24: is viego the most fun jungler, and why is he
[3:00:58] auri_sariel: @TheLoho depends on the state of ur lanes, if u dont have prio in mid and top then taking grubs or objectives in general are risky af
[3:01:10] solidussovis: @assoun24 If you have a deep champ pool he is great. If not you may be in for a rough time

[3:12:08] nwa4lifeTV: SourPls
[3:12:12] Diamonddusts: What a perfect song for Kayn xD
[3:12:24] Rodacon: In a similar vein, I have never been ableto roll r's and I have no idea how to even try.
[3:12:32] lewhitehd69: o A A A A NODDERS
[3:12:43] solidussovis: This is a pretty good Kayn song
[3:13:05] nautowar43: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[3:13:21] lewhitehd69: @Santorin wat happened to the panini acc?
[3:13:22] GoodGuy_Koopa: GoodGuy_Koopa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:13:22] alabamahammer02: Can you explain blue/red kayn, their builds and purpose?

[3:13:51] solidussovis: that's the quick explination
[3:14:01] iammite: u aaaaa
[3:14:18] Ozsu: should have flashed for dh proc
[3:14:20] auri_sariel: @alabamahammer02 blue kayn is an assassin, red kayn is a bruiser
[3:14:23] Rodacon: Shen's trying to lower the Shen winrate even more LUL
[3:14:40] lewhitehd69: top already lost Aware
[3:14:57] solidussovis: Red Kayn is a better team fighter
[3:15:12] solidussovis: When red kayn isn't nerfed in the trash
[3:15:16] auri_sariel: Shen got Olafed
[3:15:31] Diamonddusts: Wait what Shen doesn't take TP? or is it on cd? o.o
[3:15:34] Social_Phobia: shen got vikinged
[3:15:50] Zeiik101: A lot of Shens take ignite instead of tp
[3:16:03] auri_sariel: Shens face got smothered by them Olafs cheeks
[3:16:13] Rodacon: I remember when I tried Kayn, I'd spam right click when using e in a wall as force of habit, and it would pop me out of the wall before e ended. Is that a common thing/interaction?
[3:16:14] Ozsu: fed olaf soraka, gg!
[3:16:19] madladzzzz: e was excpecting kayn famous lvl 1 gank
[3:16:20] Zeiik101: Showing up to lane vs olaf at 70% HP didn't help
[3:16:32] solidussovis: I really think this is a great Kayn song for real
[3:16:43] auri_sariel: Ahri, Soraka, Lulu getting buffed tomorrow i already cant wait for tomorrow to come
[3:16:51] solidussovis: Just get you so amped to kill players

[3:17:15] nautowar43: wrong skin
[3:17:48] lewhitehd69: gwubbies widepeepoHappy
[3:17:53] denryan03: Hi idol how's your day 🫰
[3:18:15] Jakmo: Kayn clears grubs quite quickly
[3:18:21] auri_sariel: why do some casters started calling them Kevins, i dunno who started it in LEC casting but someone called em ed, edd n eddy, whoever watched that cartoon would totally agree
[3:18:32] lewhitehd69: :tf:
[3:18:51] Jakmo: probably the same type of joke that took off like Shelly, that's really funny though
[3:19:01] solidussovis: Which means Shen is taunting to get away from Olaf. Never a good thing for a shen
[3:19:03] auri_sariel: but ed, edd n eddy is much more accurate!
[3:19:09] auri_sariel: more fun!
[3:19:15] Jakmo: what do they call second grubs?
[3:19:36] iiNumb3rz: What elo is good ol chat disabler97?
[3:19:42] auri_sariel: @Santorin i just realised my curse actually applies, again u started losing hard since i joined
[3:20:05] nwa4lifeTV: if he didnt walk away i think he would killed
[3:20:08] nwa4lifeTV: unskilled player
[3:20:21] iiNumb3rz: Lol gold elo exists. That button would get worn out in 1 day
[3:20:43] Jakmo: in gold you at least expect them to be unskilled
[3:21:13] auri_sariel: @iiNumb3rz tbh i didnt noticed the difference between a diamond 4 player and gold 4 players in terms of skill in huge majority
[3:21:14] iiNumb3rz: Lol he cant see the ping mate
[3:21:39] lewhitehd69: should have given the bounty to shen FeelsWeirdMan
[3:21:40] iiNumb3rz: @auri_sariel I just use gold because that's where I'm hardstuck
[3:21:49] Rodacon: Despairge
[3:22:22] auri_sariel: @iiNumb3rz i mean if i hard gap a diamond 3  jungle main but struggle against a random gold 3 shyvana jungle in terms of macro, theres just not much difference
[3:22:52] iiNumb3rz: Oh no I agree completely. But bronze is a whole different animal.
[3:23:30] lewhitehd69: NODDERS
[3:23:35] auri_sariel: my curse is real, i legit dont remember the last time i saw u win a match, even today when i joined, since then u only lost X_X
[3:23:54] iiNumb3rz: My personal favorite ping is when I'm clearing my bottom side and my top laner gets solo bolo and ? Pings me
[3:24:18] Jakmo: @iiNumb3rz you of course pinged that their jung was top right before that didn't you? same as me?

[3:58:38] Jakmo: yeah, I stole 4 objectives in one game for an enemy jungle because they started all of them with smite
[3:58:47] solidussovis: @auri_sariel They may have patched it already I just havn't paid attention
[3:59:00] GreenBaePackers: Have you tried yone jungle? Kappa
[3:59:01] nwa4lifeTV: yone scales infinitely?
[3:59:07] jonasthr1: whats the zac support guys name?
[3:59:25] Falcnation: the other team has the teletubbies this game for once
[3:59:47] auri_sariel: Bard the hero!
[4:00:17] Alveneb: bard be like: ok jhin is coming i'll keep zac from reviving here
[4:00:20] auri_sariel: Bard probably thought it stops ur jellies to get to mid KEKW
[4:00:36] Jakmo: Santorin is already golden, Bard ult can't hurt him
[4:00:51] GreenBaePackers: Nah we need MORE
[4:00:58] GreenBaePackers: More BM
[4:01:02] auri_sariel: @Jakmo you mean piss colored?
[4:01:11] GreenBaePackers: Let em know
[4:01:14] Jakmo: @GreenBaePackers he lost vision though so no more peepoSad
[4:01:28] Jakmo: @Jakmo is a piss on called a golden shower? still works
[4:01:29] Foxy111: I just joined, what did Yone do
[4:01:30] Alveneb: fuck riot
[4:01:47] Jakmo: @Foxy111 he played fairly poorly in their previous game and they lost
[4:01:54] auri_sariel: @Jakmo gold is nice and shiny, this is piss colored KEKW
[4:01:55] GreenBaePackers: So is that guy actually boosted or what
[4:01:57] nwa4lifeTV: 06 yone reported FeelsBadMan
[4:03:46] hey_im_rabid: left his computer unlocked now his little bro is playing on his account
[4:04:05] sebastianminiatures: morning boss, sorry I'm late o7
[4:05:09] Drpasco: no mejais :'(
[4:05:11] ntmadeit: surely we buy mejais
[4:05:37] Jakmo: how are you liking protobelt?
[4:06:16] nwa4lifeTV: deathcap
[4:06:22] crecentbear: holy liandrys got nerfed
[4:06:39] Jakmo: Meteos was playing a lot of Top Zac and was normally doing full tank. Iceborn was doing a lot
[4:07:26] bonusdmg2noobs: nice script xd
[4:07:30] nwa4lifeTV: scripting monkaW
[4:07:44] GreenBaePackers: Almoosttt looked like a script no joke
[4:07:56] crecentbear: actual might be scripting
[4:08:22] GreenBaePackers: You flash q the wall and he ghost + sidesteps??? SUS
[4:08:22] Levo311: "i have more kills than the enemy team, but im just boosted" mhmmm
[4:08:36] Jakmo: Yone is always a threat
[4:08:47] falc0nas: 0/10 powerspike
[4:09:34] Alveneb: golden blob EZ
[4:10:29] GreenBaePackers: So how do you close this game out if you weren't for funning it, baron?
[4:11:00] nwa4lifeTV: jhin scripting
[4:11:27] nwa4lifeTV: no way for him to dodge that q
[4:11:32] Toiletsmurf: definitely scripting
[4:11:34] Mikytka: SHOW LIANDRIES DAMAGE!
[4:11:34] crecentbear: masters is the most scripted elo i believe
[4:11:35] solidussovis: Dirty Scripter
[4:11:41] Toiletsmurf: all your super skills are still there
[4:11:49] DeathWaffle: Make sure to report him lol
[4:11:54] GreenBaePackers: YESSSS MORE BM
[4:11:55] crecentbear: ^
[4:11:55] solidussovis: LOLOLOL\
[4:11:56] nwa4lifeTV: thats why senna left coz there was no way to kill him
[4:11:56] Levo311: note to self, never cross santorin
[4:11:58] hey_im_rabid: KEKW
[4:12:02] GreenBaePackers: MORE BM MORE BM
[4:12:02] Jakmo: Jhin's MS would certainly facilitate scripting
[4:12:06] solidussovis: That was great Santo
[4:12:12] louiecheese: HAHAHAHA
[4:12:16] DarksidexCGx: The Zac tbag rip
[4:12:27] GreenBaePackers: Nah it's to send a MESSAGE
[4:12:29] DeathWaffle: There no way he isnt, he's dodging pretty much everything
[4:12:32] Levo311: that was some classic halo tbag level of tbagging
[4:12:32] solidussovis: It was worth to continue sending the message
[4:13:14] nwa4lifeTV: i think yone e out of range
[4:13:16] Alveneb: canlose monkaW
[4:13:18] solidussovis: Abyssal Mask
[4:13:35] nwa4lifeTV: its out of vision so the script doesnt work
[4:13:43] Jakmo: Yone did E out of range. checked the clip
[4:14:02] solidussovis: Supp is so weak this patch
[4:14:09] Jakmo: I was gonna say, 6/2/19 vs 0/11/3 LuL
[4:14:31] solidussovis: Easy to play and solo bolo carries. Supp is in a good place santorinLUL
[4:14:39] Jakmo: Why doesn't Xin have infinite stacks. rip
[4:15:05] GreenBaePackers: Oh God running it back
[4:15:18] auri_sariel: thats a lot of gold u guys gave em though
[4:15:19] Alveneb: I'm scared
[4:15:41] GreenBaePackers: Champion release gap RIP
[4:15:54] Jakmo: it's auri_sariel 's fault if this is a loss tbf
[4:15:56] GreenBaePackers: Zac was what, 2010?
[4:16:16] DJ_Photik: Yoo
[4:16:25] Jakmo: 2013
[4:16:36] auri_sariel: @Jakmo and its thanks to me if he wins hue hue hue
[4:16:43] GreenBaePackers: I'm so confused on this macro ngl
[4:17:11] GreenBaePackers: What is team doing
[4:17:26] nwa4lifeTV: 45
[4:18:26] auri_sariel: that was an adc brain play
[4:18:27] GreenBaePackers: LOL nahhh you are 1v9
[4:18:42] solidussovis: It's fine Santo. You are playing Zac. Brain is goo
[4:18:45] nwa4lifeTV: need watch replay
[4:19:01] GreenBaePackers: Vod angle on jhin
[4:19:14] auri_sariel: @solidussovis isnt Brain goo in general though?
[4:19:58] auri_sariel: @Santorin check TF how did he lose flash
[4:20:15] LiILamb: hes not
[4:20:18] auri_sariel: yes sylas
[4:20:34] auri_sariel: yeah during the match u were curious how did he lose his flash xD
[4:20:49] solidussovis: @auri_sariel That is technically true. So good point
[4:21:00] imillionpegasus: santorinWave santorinWave santorinWave
[4:21:13] definitelynotkus: check in slow if he tries to dodge senna q
[4:21:48] LiILamb: its just easy to dodge stuff on jhin because he gets lots of ms and his character is very thin
[4:22:23] solidussovis: Does everyone love getting the compliment when enemy says "you're scripting" and you are not.
[4:22:47] Gambit2012: draven lock like that kinda bold, no?
[4:23:00] GreenBaePackers: Bro needs a refund on scripts then LOL
[4:23:04] definitelynotkus: i think the new scripts use ai so they sometimes deviate from perfect so its hard to tell
[4:23:13] Toiletsmurf: I missed the end, had to take the dog out. Did you win or your team throw the match?
[4:23:23] solidussovis: @Toiletsmurf he won
[4:23:27] Toiletsmurf: nice
[4:24:14] Rhaegar_UGKz: lmao if you guys win this it’s complete brain/hand dif
[4:24:15] riseofdemon: scripting also dodges all skill shots right?
[4:24:52] definitelynotkus: @riseofdemon the new ones use ai and will sometimes deviate bc riot has a great script recognition system
[4:24:59] solidussovis: If there is no where to dodge the champ essentially stands stoll
[4:25:07] solidussovis: still
[4:25:08] hey_im_rabid: Which one is the Jhin?
[4:25:10] Jakmo: ask him then cliffEvil
[4:25:14] lol_cray: What MMR is this acc ?
[4:26:43] Jakmo: you'd think getting some passive on Morde would be nice to leash Krugs
[4:28:26] GreenBaePackers: WHAT
[4:28:54] GreenBaePackers: Add more doodoo to the list
[4:29:00] bowsling1: because you touch yourself at night!
[4:29:32] GreenBaePackers: I feel nauseated watching that
[4:30:15] nwa4lifeTV: illaoi passive
[4:30:21] solidussovis: Tentical smacked the grubs
[4:30:21] CESlush: wait, has solo Q ever given a fuck about jg?
[4:31:41] Jakmo: wp by Draven honestly
[4:31:59] BenjaminGreen: banger song
[4:32:03] BenjaminGreen: why red over blue btw?
[4:32:12] lol_cray: Idk ur flaming is kinda wholesome D:
[4:32:34] BenjaminGreen: thats fair
[4:32:47] Jakmo: I tend to mix up colors depending on comps, good to hear I'm not crazy
[4:34:26] trashpanda_oz: chat disabler is back.
[4:35:03] trashpanda_oz: wait their team comp is literally 5 s tier champs
[4:35:07] trashpanda_oz: who made this draft.
[4:35:13] d1a_lol: i feel like every zed u get runs it LUL
[4:35:15] bodylikeyourdad: I wish they would take care of vex and make her playable again;(
[4:35:32] Jakmo: played mid a lot. it really hurts when you have to play AD
[4:36:15] l9sandy: @bodylikeyourdad shes literally 50% wr how is she unplayable XD
[4:36:44] lol_cray: L9 draven things
[4:36:59] Jakmo: a near pure 50% isn't related to playability. it usually means only the best play and they still struggle
[4:37:55] l9sandy: @Jakmo just wrong, if someone is getting near 50% on a champ then u can too if u play well
[4:38:08] Jakmo: that's not true at all
[4:38:23] madladzzzz: did you know that the band Boston is almost a 1 man band. all the instruments is 1 guy plus a singer. that’s mostly why it never lifted live
[4:38:39] definitelynotkus: varus micro dodge into auto btw, not necissarily a script, but it always looks sus to walk at spear after pixel clearing range of hitbox
[4:39:04] BenjaminGreen: that trap clean
[4:39:04] l9sandy: @Jakmo Lol, unplayable status would be like 46% WR. if you are complaining bc ur champ is at a 50% wr then its a skill issue
[4:39:08] GreenBaePackers: NICE
[4:39:29] d1a_lol: is pharaoh nidalee your fav skin? saw u use it years ago too
[4:40:00] Jakmo: you realize that even some of the strongest champs can have 46% w/r because it becomes popular and people play poorly. one number does not EVER reflect the strength of a champ. I'm done responding too
[4:40:19] BenjaminGreen: monkaS
[4:40:29] basik: illaoi is a wild champ
[4:40:34] d1a_lol: @Jakmo i agree. it only reflects how the avg player are performing on them relative to win/loss, that's pretty much it
[4:40:39] Shaidyn: EZ
[4:40:42] GreenBaePackers: Morde kept healing her LUL
[4:40:47] d1a_lol: it's only statistics
[4:40:49] jonasthr1: @Jakmo but why are you complaining vex litterally have 52 % winrate in 60k games in emerald+
[4:40:56] crecentbear: I JUST GOT MY PLAYSTATION ACCOUNT BACK AFTER IT WAS HACKED OMFG LETS GO
[4:40:57] basik: illaoi is basically a tower defense minigame
[4:40:58] Jakmo: I didn't complain about Vex at all
[4:41:03] Jakmo: I don't play her
[4:41:23] BenjaminGreen: F
[4:41:40] Diamonddusts: They played back o.o
[4:41:47] GreenBaePackers: We do a littleeee bit a trolling LUL
[4:42:18] GreenBaePackers: It's to establish dominance
[4:42:50] l9sandy: @Jakmo i agree with you, stats need context. I was talking specifically about vex
[4:44:14] GreenBaePackers: KS KS KS REEEE Keepo
[4:44:47] GreenBaePackers: Baron just took a peak at y'all at drake monkaS
[4:45:21] hey_im_rabid: If draven tried to auto there he would have at least got one kill KEKW
[4:45:27] GreenBaePackers: Teammates are really good, promise
[4:45:50] minho12342: holy shit!
[4:45:55] minho12342: so bad
[4:46:24] auri_sariel: @Santorin btw did you see Zeus  get shit on by DnDn on his signature Ksante today?
[4:46:53] GreenBaePackers: Must. Resist. Urge. To. Flame. These. Dogs. Fuuuckkk
[4:49:41] GreenBaePackers: Nice try
[4:50:26] auri_sariel: T1 played against nongshim and Zeus picked his signature Ksante pick, DnDn solo boloed him twice with poppy in lane
[4:50:30] GreenBaePackers: This feels like trying to keep a baby alive that's continually trying to jump off a cliff
[4:51:52] GreenBaePackers: WE WIN THOOOSEEE
[4:51:54] GreenBaePackers: LWTS GO
[4:52:09] BenjaminGreen: has nida been picked in pro lately at all?
[4:52:45] BenjaminGreen: Sadge
[4:53:38] GreenBaePackers: End end endendednendeddd
[4:53:44] BenjaminGreen: ggggggggg
[4:53:58] GreenBaePackers: Unreal gg
[4:54:47] nwa4lifeTV: rengar main monkaW

[4:57:39] GreenBaePackers: RIP
[4:57:47] GreenBaePackers: How's Diana looking these dyas
[4:57:52] dekaras: hiho santorinHey santorinCheers santorinWave

[4:58:18] dekaras: today good man thx hope you too
[4:58:38] GreenBaePackers: Veigo!
[4:58:43] nautowar43: looking like a noct angle
[4:58:46] lubemila: santorinCheers santorinWave santorinCheers
[4:58:54] giopanag: <3 <3 <3
[4:59:07] GreenBaePackers: Yi?
[4:59:18] solidussovis: godfist
[4:59:22] Jakmo: skin doesn't matter, he's blind
[4:59:23] LiILamb: fist em
[4:59:32] ch3m15try: ye god fist bro
[4:59:47] ch3m15try: not racist lee sin confirmed
[5:01:07] Jakmo: Dragon Trainer Trist would fit well there too
[5:01:34] basik: you should have played storm dragon lee
[5:01:37] Jakmo: Dragon Trainer Malzahar would be pretty cool too
[5:01:51] Jakmo: I'm saying that they should make the skin, not that it exists
[5:03:44] Jakmo: there's no way he didn't flash
[5:03:54] Chronexe: @Santorin How tall are you ? just wondering lol
[5:05:10] lolCrazyBear: You lived for to long in LA u forgot about eu mesurments
[5:05:38] Jakmo: as an American, I still feel that the metric system makes more logical sense. I can admit that
[5:05:54] GreenBaePackers: Gl @Santorin I'm hopping on some soloq! Later bro
[5:06:30] Jakmo: WOW that was a play
[5:06:33] lubemila: santorinFP santorinFP santorinFP santorinFP
[5:06:40] motorboater2: janna top tier exhaust timing
[5:06:44] Jakmo: threw up from the rollercoaster of emotions??
[5:06:58] blueknight0007: Have you watched Watchman?
[5:07:45] basik: watchmen is an all time great movie
[5:07:54] lolCrazyBear: Is this a smurf acc? What elo is this?
[5:07:56] Chronexe: Are you staying in Toronto right now ?
[5:07:58] blueknight0007: It a superhero movie that was pretty good. just thought of it because this song is played in a sccene.
[5:08:18] Jakmo: this song is an all time great and everywhere, so that makes sense
[5:08:48] Grynox15: I find that Janna super annoying
[5:08:53] nwa4lifeTV: just press w
[5:08:58] nwa4lifeTV: LUL
[5:09:00] motorboater2: i was watching the high intense execute in top lane that whole time
[5:09:18] motorboater2: yi and aatrox playing ring around the rosy
[5:09:36] Jakmo: and now Yi is fed
[5:09:45] dekaras: rumbel is a fan :D
[5:09:57] SunYoshi_HS: something tells me “mage tea” isn’t a boosted enchanter plauer
[5:10:03] SunYoshi_HS: xdd
[5:10:28] dekaras: hm bot locks not good  :8
[5:10:57] Gambit2012: is this 3/4 games of losing bot lane now?
[5:11:03] solidussovis: This feels like a Super Teemo song. A little bit cringe, but deep down we all love it
[5:11:44] dekaras: just mid wins the lane other strugel hard
[5:12:30] Jakmo: has this Rumble never played against a heimer? very unfortunate game for him
[5:12:35] Morderator: Does janna get an assist when her mates run towards her and they get the extra move speed because of jannas passive?
[5:12:45] Jakmo: @Morderator no
[5:12:53] Grynox15: Is it efficient to leave for example one raptor alive when you counter jungle? Is there a scenario where it's useful?
[5:13:27] nwa4lifeTV: 700 + 600
[5:13:29] Jakmo: @Grynox15 if he doesn't answer, it used to be because it prevented camp respawn, but it doesn't do that anymore so most no longer do
[5:13:40] giopanag: how is it possible hwei is 9lvl and u 8
[5:13:54] dekaras: jo support have 5 kills :D
[5:14:10] Grynox15: @Jakmo Wait, It doesn't work anymore? omg, I'm old and dumb
[5:14:47] Jakmo: yeah, they changed so little parts of a camp will eventually die and the camp respawns as normal based on the big one
[5:14:55] solidussovis: LOL yeah it changed last season I think for jungle camps. Took me by surprise too Grynox
[5:15:42] basik: Aatrox wants to win
[5:16:13] Jakmo: still ahead on kills and cs, but it's a Lee vs Yi so time is not on your side
[5:16:42] solidussovis: When does Lee lose to Yi at any point in the game?
[5:17:10] Jakmo: it's not a set time but the closest you could say is 3 items
[5:17:22] basik: yi is hard to deal with at 4 items
[5:18:10] Jakmo: Smolder has watched too much DoubleLift and wanted to try it
[5:19:22] solidussovis: deaths dance
[5:19:30] nwa4lifeTV: black cleaver?
[5:19:33] giopanag: hexdrinker or steraks
[5:19:43] iiNumb3rz: Who is the best tank jng right now? Sejuani pretty bad right now right?
[5:19:48] Jakmo: Yi almost has two items monkaS
[5:20:09] motorboater2: hes a new champ, dont expect a nerf for at least another year
[5:20:23] iiNumb3rz: How do you play this match up with leesin into yi?
[5:20:38] solidussovis: 1 v 1 I don't think yi can fight lee unless yi is way ahead... but yi can stomp the rest of the team so it is concerning
[5:20:56] Jakmo: did Yi think he could win that??
[5:21:01] iiNumb3rz: How tf did you just do that to yi?
[5:21:11] dekaras: lets  goooooooooooo
[5:21:35] solidussovis: That Heimer
[5:21:36] Jakmo: @solidussovis Yi can win the 1v1, it's just really hard and they didn't do that correctly at all
[5:21:42] dekaras: you and heimer carry this man
[5:21:52] trashpanda_oz: the dragon warrior looool
[5:22:15] iiNumb3rz: Csn you invade yi on leesin early?
[5:22:38] spenzor21: @iiNumb3rz no cant
[5:22:51] spenzor21: after 6 lee can win vs yi before 6 yi kills lee
[5:23:21] Jakmo: I'm fairly certain that Lee hard wins level 2 and 3
[5:23:24] iiNumb3rz: So you're kicking him then sending another q at him as he flies away?
[5:23:52] spenzor21: no lee doesnt win any level before 6
[5:23:58] spenzor21: againts yi
[5:24:10] Jakmo: @iiNumb3rz that's the typical play pattern with Lee, yeah. You don't want to R until after he's used Q or is in execute
[5:24:11] trashpanda_oz: @spenzor21 yeah he does
[5:24:22] spenzor21: in ur elo yes he does
[5:25:16] Jakmo: I'm gonna trust the ex-pro challenger streamer over the random chat, sorry
[5:25:33] SeeMeNoMas: @Jakmo big mistake tbh
[5:25:48] GetLukedLive: What is this playlist?
[5:25:52] Jakmo: yeah, that's fair. Santorin is probably gaslighting us lol
[5:26:03] iiNumb3rz: Lee sin is so fun early game. I just wish the game ended at 20 minutes because I feel useless on him after that
[5:26:09] solidussovis: LOL I will also trust the Jungle GOAT we are watching on the lee yi discussion
[5:26:09] GetLukedLive: ! playlist
[5:26:14] SeeMeNoMas: @Jakmo Exactly, you understand :)
[5:26:19] GhostxxHorse: !playlist
[5:26:19] Nightbot: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/797qF06iTfzkYQiCmg4OCS?si=b378bc6fa614434d
[5:26:30] Jakmo: Yi only wins if he dodges Lee Q with his Q
[5:27:08] solidussovis: So Yi beats lee if the lee is terrible on the champ
[5:27:15] iiNumb3rz: So you're just doing qq ee then using w to get away?
[5:27:25] brightdiscord: 3/12 smolder
[5:27:31] Jakmo: @iiNumb3rz I can't play him and I hate it. I can't get over not being able to self-cast W.
[5:27:50] iiNumb3rz: Yeah it is weird that you have to target yourself
[5:27:53] GhostxxHorse: permaban smolder to keep your team from picking him
[5:27:58] solidussovis: Doesn't matter Aatrox is going to beat everyone LOL
[5:28:07] Jakmo: @iiNumb3rz you do second Q later in the fight when it's close to expired because it does more damage the lower hp they are
[5:28:09] Gizmo_Stuff: ult every minion wave
[5:28:10] BenjaminGreen: sheesh
[5:28:23] dekaras: the king in the jungel
[5:28:25] iiNumb3rz: Dude now that I've played yi and seen you play it. I realize how bad I am at him
[5:28:36] iiNumb3rz: Lee* not yi
[5:28:51] Jakmo: I always get baited into thinking it would be simple to play Lee and I lose hard LUL
[5:29:18] solidussovis: Lee is anything but simple. I have played him since lee came out and I still fugg up the combos
