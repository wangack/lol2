[0:22:58] notclarkyyy: karma?
[0:22:59] sabiirox: diana is good against him
[0:23:01] Splashur: TF is good into corki
[0:23:10] gretchen2137: i always play lux into corki  and i always win lane
[0:23:18] Martybggg: Orianna is rly good cuz you outrange him in lane, same for other mages, assassins are good
[0:23:19] Darkcyter: @gretchen2137 kaypHello
[0:23:21] jimbob_ywert: Taliyah, Aurelion, Anshan, Cass, and Vlad are his biggest counters
[0:23:35] jimbob_ywert: a good irelia will just shit on a corki no matter what
[0:23:41] gretchen2137: @Darkcyter kaypPengu
[0:24:16] innerpeace1: Kassadin counter corki
[0:24:55] jimbob_ywert: Corki struggles against Taliyah the most this season
[0:25:24] innerpeace1: Is fizz good into corki
[0:25:34] Teekwan: Hello miss Kay, hello chat <3 Hope your Wednesday is fine, mine started terribly, found out all of my chickens were slaughtered by stray dogs, and the meeting with friends is cancelled, so i'm hoping that a few matches of league will beat me up to the point where i can get motivated StinkyCheese
[0:25:41] watermeelon_juice: I heard they changing seraphine soon I hope they bring back her ap ratio
[0:26:12] jimbob_ywert: Taliyah is just generally super strong rn, she can outrange corki and save her W and E for his jump
[0:26:30] CasperForce: Hi kp KonCha
[0:27:06] Hymuno: worth a shot
[0:27:07] yukkur1: he is strong with malignance
[0:27:07] piertotum_: i think he is boring to play
[0:27:08] zavislane: play Lux man
[0:27:09] watermeelon_juice: corki is strong in both ap and ad it’s so disgusting
[0:27:16] theenation97: I think his winrate is pretty low though
[0:27:16] jimbob_ywert: Corki might be the most KP pick KP ever picks
[0:27:22] sabiirox: are we getting any lux or vex games today? kaypCozy
[0:27:28] yukkur1: yo should buy malignance with ahri
[0:27:34] luhul: Hi kaypea ive been struggling with this season what are some of the best builds for a mage?
[0:27:38] S17Master: Malph has tank items
[0:27:48] watermeelon_juice: ur botlane is fed af
[0:27:55] SneakyTheWalrus: Why cant you type? maayaHuh
[0:27:59] PulsefireLux13: why can’t u type?
[0:28:02] jimbob_ywert: Guys what syndra skin should I get?
[0:28:06] innerpeace1: Still corki easy to deal with compare to 0/10 yone can still kill you without hitting q or r
[0:28:12] piertotum_: muted
[0:28:18] Teekwan: @KayPea what's worse is that we had a few hatchlings just yesterday, it seems that life wasn't meant for them. But it is what it is, you're doing so well, i'm just gonna get mesmerised by your gameplay kaypFlower
[0:28:19] S17Master: @jimbob_ywert Coven or Star Guardian imo
[0:28:21] piertotum_: ahh ok
[0:28:22] PulsefireLux13: ahhh okay
[0:29:02] Zeberdie: dont forget ornn upgrades whatever item is top left now
[0:29:15] Teekwan: Ornathan will pop off, we believe
[0:29:43] padampadamm: haiii everyoneee
[0:29:54] watermeelon_juice: I guess the best thing to do is play slow considering smolder scale really hard late game
[0:29:58] piertotum_: @Teekwan i loved your logic! one of the times we can only play the "it is what it is" card
[0:30:27] padampadamm: they buff ahri tomorrow so you'll be stronger then
[0:30:29] padampadamm: more impact
[0:30:30] xBoomShotBaby: your farm is good kaypComfy
[0:30:33] innerpeace1: I just noticed now there is a pyke in your team. Never saw puke roam...
[0:30:41] innerpeace1: Pyke
[0:31:02] sovitiaisavampire: !cannon
[0:31:02] Nightbot: KayPea has missed: 1219 cannon minions Clap

[0:32:43] seanixu: protePepe protePepe protePepe
[0:32:57] Teekwan: @piertotum_ There's nothing we could have done, since it happened while we were sleeping, so there's no point in beating myself about it, so we'll rebuild and try again :)
[0:33:10] Eternal_Weazel: just spam brand support LUL LUL
[0:33:13] mrshibasan: when you said rod of ages I jiust bought roa on morg rn
[0:33:30] ericaborgest: what was the buff on archs?
[0:33:50] Teekwan: Do it! Don't lett your dreams be dreams!
[0:34:01] Jaguar542: U muted all, so teammates can't complain about your build LUL
[0:34:35] jimbob_ywert: y’all what syndra skin should I get?
[0:35:03] ElminstersGhost: Riot does
[0:35:08] CaramellCat: Good afternoon everyone! How are we doing?
[0:35:54] layeuna: @jimbob_ywert imo Spirit blossom is her best skin :3 awesome splashart, nice model ingame, cool vfx, particles, sound effects and recall is great
[0:36:02] Teekwan: @jimbob_ywert My favorite one is Archlight, i know is basic but i love it the most xd
[0:36:08] Arisutra: gooooood afternoon!
[0:36:14] Martybggg: not sure about that one but I believe his hp per level got buffed at one point
[0:36:18] ayzouu_by: hello :)
[0:36:22] piertotum_: @Teekwan you're totally right. you summarized the life. try try tryyyyy
[0:36:28] Teekwan: @layeuna Spirit Blossom is pretty as well, that might be the better choice
[0:36:34] watermeelon_juice: Our girl Ahri better receive at least 3 skins this year or I will sue
[0:36:40] Danhudson123: Danhudson123 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months! hiiiiiiiiii
[0:37:05] jimbob_ywert: The barons aren’t that different in strength, one just has more damage and abilities and bit more health
[0:37:32] jimbob_ywert: this smolder needs to be peeled
[0:37:36] fearlessterp: my friend and I call him the big dumb rock
[0:37:53] Arisutra: if they'd actually contested baron, yikes
[0:38:00] drelphia: thats why they gave u that free baron xD
[0:38:14] Teekwan: @piertotum_ And always look on the bright side of life DinoDance
[0:38:20] jimbob_ywert: I go zhonyas second item if I’m against assassins
[0:38:25] Darkcyter: @Danhudson123 73 kaypHYPERS WB
[0:38:39] watermeelon_juice: @kaypea whats your next item after zhonya
[0:38:39] Arisutra: there's so much burst in the game right now, zhonya's is a great item
[0:38:53] junelacieq: junelacieq subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 30 months! my happy place kaypComfy  hope you are having a good time
[0:39:11] S17Master: Genuine question. Why do teams go fight in the jungle so often after getting Baron? Risking the buff right away instead of pushing lanes
[0:39:47] Arisutra: @S17Master the baron buff is a combat buff, so if you can wipe the enemy team after getting it, you can just win the game on the spot
[0:39:48] piertotum_: mountain guy is scary
[0:39:52] AznSensation: "i dont think we can do much" - proceeds to do much
[0:40:01] KeenanFreecs: Hi. Kaypea. peepoHey
[0:40:08] angelofdeathjonathan: Because smart people don't play league. They are too busy engineering and sciencing
[0:40:21] ElminstersGhost: I say just always build tank items, no matter what lane. win game
[0:40:55] S17Master: @Arisutra Is that a recent change? I thought it buffed minions.
[0:41:29] angelofdeathjonathan: Baron is definately minion buff
[0:41:33] xBoomShotBaby: mom kaypLunaRage
[0:41:35] Arisutra: @S17Master it's always given increased AD and AP too as far as i can recall
[0:41:38] angelofdeathjonathan: Elder dragon is the combat buff
[0:41:59] Arisutra: it buffs minions, sure, but it also buffs your damage
[0:42:08] violet_sl: hi kaypea do you have tiktok ? kaypCheer
[0:42:15] Arisutra: so fighting after you get it kinda makes sense
[0:42:26] watermeelon_juice: anyone got anti heal on ur team
[0:43:06] alluring_grace: @watermeelon_juice ornn
[0:43:19] via_trita: morning
[0:43:26] sami0_0plays: is zonaya now have more AP?
[0:43:36] angelofdeathjonathan: Baron used to buff combat stats but they stopped that in like season 10 or something
[0:44:05] layeuna: senna is like a mosquito
[0:44:32] layeuna: you mind your buisness and she goes hi lemme annoy you a bit ok bye
[0:44:47] Eternal_Weazel: three
[0:45:23] Arisutra: @angelofdeathjonathan really? can't see anything about that in the patch history aha
[0:45:35] elzter_: yeah one unchanged, one with two openings at the front and this one
[0:46:03] angelofdeathjonathan: This season they did change baron and now there are 3 types of baron, but I dunno about buff effect
[0:46:08] CipherAdminShady: Smolder's mom only cares about him and him only! No heals for the team
[0:46:18] elzter_: i like that every baron has different attacks
[0:46:25] Arisutra: it might depend on the baron now, would make sense
[0:46:34] Nicolajbruhn: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:46:38] priam0: Good afternoon KPRINHA! ☺️
[0:46:49] jimbob_ywert: do you think of coming back to syndra?
[0:46:55] angelofdeathjonathan: I think the season they came out with elder dragon was the season baron stopped affecting combat stats
[0:47:18] ElminstersGhost: Malph is a raid boss now
[0:47:21] homantic: what does package do?
[0:47:50] S17Master: @homantic Empowers W's damage, range and gives knockback
[0:48:09] cymatics_crystal: path of fire
[0:48:12] theenation97: it pushes everyone to the side he passes through also
[0:48:12] cymatics_crystal: :D
[0:49:07] jimbob_ywert: Ocean and Infernal souls are the best souls in the game, wind soul is an exception cus it depends on team comp
[0:49:17] KeenanFreecs: Yi even flashed for it KEKW
[0:49:33] Arisutra: "I'm the fox that knocks (and has a bajillion jumps)" - Walter White
[0:49:33] ElminstersGhost: I feel like they had the chance to end game when they had baron
[0:49:56] S17Master: Clean charm
[0:49:56] Baho03: all according to plan
[0:50:20] careesha15: I’m always late to stream kaypAnnoyed
[0:50:48] theenation97: find a comfortable spot on his back while he carries the team
[0:50:49] alluring_grace: Their bot lane did bad
[0:50:51] shedfirekid1: ggs
[0:50:57] S17Master: But we didn't FF FiFteen
[0:50:57] Excisionxfox13: gg!
[0:50:59] watermeelon_juice: I wonder how many stacks smolder got
[0:50:59] Chaskittyxoxo: i passed my driving test today  :D

[1:41:08] TomNova: hai everyone, hope you're having a lovely wednesday kaypFlower
[1:41:08] Rincewurst: I heard about turkey increasing sub prices. they were equal to 30 euro cents a month sp4zieDerp so kinda hard to blame that
[1:41:16] J0LLYR0GER: I had heard twitch was shafting creators
[1:41:17] Sunnytinker: and guess what the twitch subs price updates is to "help streamer revenue keep pace with rising costs"
[1:41:27] S17Master: @MayaShieda Blame Amazon
[1:41:28] JustCaptainMimmy: how the games going ?
[1:41:29] via_trita: @ballzagna1 lol, casually spending 30k just to spend it
[1:41:40] TomNova: just kinda joined in on the sub price chat, do you know why ?

[1:42:54] Sx10: @KayPea Big LOVE <3 Ziggs game was amazing in YT
[1:43:01] J0LLYR0GER: When people do donations now thats seperate from twitch correct? Its just the subs you are getting screwed on right @KayPea
[1:43:04] padampadamm: theyre gonna hate you so much if you lose top lol
[1:43:09] padampadamm: for not picking some op tan
[1:43:10] ballzagna1: (in cyberpunk lingo) fuckin corpo goons
[1:43:10] padampadamm: tank
[1:43:12] mentalfordaayz: gosh this songgg kaypVibe
[1:43:45] JustCaptainMimmy: good luck your games ^^
[1:43:49] padampadamm: called it lol
[1:43:51] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea I mean you do you but you should. Especially after these changes. Lucas knows whats up
[1:43:53] RowdyRoran: do sponsors still count as self employed or do you get considered as their employee for taxes?
[1:44:07] Wolfvet_: viego mid wtf
[1:44:23] Flloodxx: its still self employed
[1:44:27] padampadamm: so like a freelance contract basically
[1:44:28] J0LLYR0GER: correct its self employed
[1:44:34] RowdyRoran: ah ok
[1:44:35] Flloodxx: theyre outsourcing work to you and youre considered a 1099 contractor in most instances
[1:44:46] via_trita: KP, I know other streamers are switching to a main patreon sub since its more favorable to the creators since twitch is shafting everyone, not sure if you can utilize that
[1:44:46] Arisutra: yeah you won't be on their books as an employee
[1:44:50] alluring_grace: @JustCaptainMimmy is nice, but pick/ban will go up which is...
[1:45:14] padampadamm: donations is just a sign of extra support for people who really really appreciate you
[1:45:16] padampadamm: which is fine really
[1:45:33] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea I totally get that. Here  is how I look at it. If that is was you have to do to continue to stay around then its worth it
[1:45:34] ThePeePuddle: Goood day everyone! Hope you're days are going well kaypLove kaypFlower
[1:45:44] Rincewurst: isnt what you get for subbing merely aesthetics? and parasocial relations I suppose
[1:45:44] ballzagna1: why dont we make a new website like twitch but we treat the streamers better and whipe twitch off the world wide map
[1:45:47] JustCaptainMimmy: @JustCaptainMimmy i think she is not bannble much
[1:46:14] via_trita: You can link patreon to discord for perks too and could always switch to a yt stream after
[1:46:15] S17Master: @ballzagna1 The cycle would inevitably repeat itself even if it worked
[1:46:34] padampadamm: yas queen give me some edm goodnesssss kaypInLove
[1:46:35] Flloodxx: speaking of youtube, have you ever considered multistreaming?
[1:46:40] Arisutra: there are rivals to twitch
[1:46:41] J0LLYR0GER: Who are you top into?
[1:46:46] Arisutra: just not used as much aha
[1:46:52] hdthecrusaders: True that
[1:46:54] hdthecrusaders: LUL
[1:47:08] padampadamm: yep, exactly
[1:47:10] via_trita: also, w/ yt you can play spotify
[1:47:12] ballzagna1: @S17Master only if the people that run it are greedy asf. theres no way you making 30% of every streamers is "not gonna be enough"
[1:47:13] padampadamm: i know a streamer who gave up on it because of that
[1:47:13] ThePeePuddle: Going good, grinding a bit on DnD. Lost a 4-5K kit earlier due to rubberbanding so was not tilting at all kaypLUL
[1:47:18] via_trita: can't***
[1:47:19] J0LLYR0GER: YT's streaming platform is pretty ass.
[1:47:36] littlejellyfishy: littlejellyfishy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Back in the basement :D Hello there best streamer EUW and chat, how is everyone doing? kaypPengu jcvlegHeart
[1:47:49] BiSettual: What about Kick?
[1:47:53] ShadowVixenXO: yeah unless you already have a youtube audience built streaming on youtube is pretty impossible
[1:48:25] ballzagna1: DrDisrespect lost a lot of money switching from twitch to youtube
[1:48:35] littlejellyfishy: I'm slowly getting sick 3d before my birthday. Which is great kaypAnnoyed kaypAnnoyed
[1:48:37] J0LLYR0GER: Kik is well interesting
[1:48:37] Teekwan: Viktor top? But miss Kay, what happened to your alter ego, ChoPea?
[1:48:53] hdthecrusaders: Just heard it
[1:48:55] RuthlessWelshy: nope and i would not
[1:48:57] RowdyRoran: @bisettual the only way they can pay their creators that much is from the gambling expoitation im pretty sure
[1:48:59] Teekwan: what the fuck is kik?
[1:49:00] padampadamm: kick is not a good place to be
[1:49:01] Arisutra: kick is where you go if you're too toxic for anywhere else, haha
[1:49:01] CrazyCortez: i do not watch Kick streams just on principle
[1:49:01] ThePeePuddle: the thing is too, when switching platform people tend to lose a lot of audience. I've also never once opened the kick website
[1:49:02] padampadamm: genuinely
[1:49:04] Rincewurst: Kik is a super cheap store here in germany
[1:49:07] J0LLYR0GER: IMO its cool as an idea but its a sespool
[1:49:08] Hymuno: I only watch one streamer on kick and its very rarely
[1:49:09] tronofcool: made an account and used it once
[1:49:15] Axohne: its just early twitch imo
[1:49:17] JustCaptainMimmy: mm i think twitch is better platform my opinion
[1:49:25] VamPoppy: kick is ewyyy
[1:49:31] S17Master: Kick is for bigotry and gambling addiction exploitation
[1:49:40] Dinamate97: Dinamate97 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 62 months! Happy Wednesday and good evening kaypLove kaypLove kaypLove
[1:49:41] padampadamm: its insane how much they push online gambling streaming and targetting minors with it
[1:49:44] padampadamm: its disgusting
[1:49:57] Darkcyter: @Dinamate97 62 kaypHYPERS WB
[1:50:02] VamPoppy: peepoBlanket
[1:50:09] Arisutra: ^ the gambling side of it is just straight unethical
[1:50:09] littlejellyfishy: @Darkcyter kaypHello kaypFlower
[1:50:16] Darkcyter: I've watched kick but the emoting feels difficult, probably because how I'm so habituated here
[1:50:19] Darkcyter: @littlejellyfishy kaypHello
[1:50:30] penguminari0324: how about tiktok platform for streaming? no?
[1:50:32] kingprime: kingprime subscribed with Prime.

[1:51:09] belallaj: is it really that bad? ive never been on it
[1:51:16] kingprime: Hello people HeyGuys
[1:51:21] padampadamm: @belallaj it really is :S
[1:51:36] Darkcyter: @JustCaptainMimmy kaypHello
[1:51:37] lycoris_radiiata: a lot of streamers that i watch they do it on tiktok too
[1:52:10] Teekwan: I think TikTok is a toxic platform as well
[1:52:13] littlejellyfishy: SO, they allow people to be little pp and horrendous people. Got it kaypNoted
[1:52:13] doublemeatpalace: @Arisutra I mean Amazon as a company is just as unethical. I don't think trying to pick a morally better one makes much sense.
[1:52:20] Arisutra: kick was born out of the marriage betwen twitch's leaked source code and a chinese gambling company
[1:52:23] rescued: you also can’t make money off tiktok in certain countries like Canada cause of laws
[1:52:24] J0LLYR0GER: tiktok is not vialbe at ALL its just to try and bring people to ur twitch/YT
[1:52:34] yanjii: I think its more worth to keep your all time viewers on Twitch than lose them while moving through
[1:52:37] hdthecrusaders: RIVEN player not  trying to 1v9 maybe waiting for 6
[1:52:39] Arisutra: @doublemeatpalace you ain't wrong there
[1:52:41] Rincewurst: @Teekwan I mean TikTok is multi faceted but the format just makes you dumb xD
[1:52:49] padampadamm: @Arisutra kaypWHAT
[1:53:05] ThePeePuddle: the only thing I feel tiktok is good for is promoting your main channel and stream by posting clips and shit
[1:53:11] J0LLYR0GER: still almost traded tehre
[1:53:13] shedfirekid1: riven all in is disgusting
[1:53:22] alluring_grace: @penguminari0324 idk why people use it despite the controversy of it, from China
[1:53:33] OhHiiJames: could you not have bought ur items while dead and ur R would of done more damage?
[1:53:47] J0LLYR0GER: Hit the nail on the head
[1:53:49] MayaShieda: oh god the other day i had a nightmare where a new champ called Cosmic Capital turned the midlane to rainbow road and made the enemy champs go to unskippable ad lanf
[1:53:49] padampadamm: @alluring_grace its really not tiny bit different from ig and fb, selling your personal data to the highest bidder
[1:53:51] padampadamm: they all do it
[1:53:58] MayaShieda: land* making ur account get banned
[1:54:10] J0LLYR0GER: ohhhhhh
[1:54:15] k0t10n: kaypArrive hello @KayPea it is I your daily reminder to remind you to put map cover on!
[1:54:19] jimbob_ywert: Who would you say is better, syndra or viktor?
[1:54:21] J0LLYR0GER: yeah honestly doesnt seem worht the effort
[1:54:28] lycoris_radiiata: yeah people post clips from here to tiktok
[1:54:31] ThePeePuddle: yeah, that's a fair point
[1:54:36] Rincewurst: thats because TikTok is much more dopaminergic. Many short videos creating short term highs with no downtime. ruins the emotional capacity and attention span of viewers
[1:54:40] Arisutra: well, trainwreck the streamer was sponsored by a chinese gambling company when a twitch streamer, made a shit load from it, created kick with the money
[1:54:48] OhHiiJames: @k0t10n it is on..
[1:54:53] VamPoppy: if u go viral on tiktok u will probably get lots of followers but ppl staying is a different story PepeHands
[1:55:01] k0t10n: @k0t10n I am blind i cant see
[1:55:11] jimbob_ywert: Logan Paul
[1:55:19] JustCaptainMimmy: for my opinion Streaming it not that easy you need to do alot of stuff
[1:55:40] padampadamm: attention span of titkot users is shorter than that of  a 3 day old baby lol
[1:55:54] sovitiaisavampire: attention span on tiktok is non existant
[1:55:54] Rincewurst: if youre just asshat, you will have a hard time keeping a following OpieOP
[1:56:10] J0LLYR0GER: Its all pre-recorded vs. Live content. Its drastically different. There are people I enjoy for their vids but not streams and vice-a-versa\
[1:56:10] MayaShieda: @Rincewurst i got actually addicted to that ish i'd spend hours without realising then spiral when i realise the day was over, i deleted the app as soon as i noticed the pattern
[1:56:15] lycoris_radiiata: i follow a girl here on twitch thanx to tiktok cuz  it show me her content there like clips and things jaajja
[1:56:17] smilodoncat: it's short form content vs long form. most ppl on tiktok and the like don't have the attention span for streaming/twitch
[1:56:20] RowdyRoran: i mean he also became a crypto clown, ppl probably were expecting goofy jokes and got that
[1:56:23] imondop: you get same content by kesha in tiktok or twitch its all the same :D :D
[1:56:41] padampadamm: why the hell did ashe come top wtf lol
[1:56:43] Rincewurst: @MayaShieda very healthy and probably just in time, too!
[1:56:52] Jaguar542: On tiktok your are appealing to a viewer base with 5 seconds  attention span, where Twitch is hours of live content
[1:56:53] OrianaLand: OrianaLand subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! WINNABLE
[1:56:57] JustCaptainMimmy: so close
[1:57:10] pumpernickel3: nice dodge on the charm ♥️
[1:57:15] sabiirox: hows the games been so far?
[1:57:44] J0LLYR0GER: There is a very real issue among children now that have access to tiktok. The drop off of intentionspan is actaully VERY BAD
[1:58:00] padampadamm: @J0LLYR0GER they've closely connected it to rise in autism
[1:58:05] padampadamm: no joke, there was a clinical study
[1:58:18] k0t10n: rivening
[1:58:21] controldevil__: kaypea u dont play lux anymore?
[1:58:39] Arisutra: @padampadamm what's the name of the study?
[1:58:39] k0t10n: tiktok is a disease
[1:58:44] yanjii: didnt the fortnite Ninja lose like hunder thousands if not milions of followers just bcs he swaped the streaming platform?
[1:59:07] J0LLYR0GER: Thats why both my kids dont get access to stuff like that and wont until they are MUCH older. The only thing they get is limited screen time for stuff like disney
[1:59:12] sovitiaisavampire: attention span in millenials was already bad, gen Z was doomed but gen alpha never stood a chance
[1:59:13] k0t10n: freyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[1:59:16] VamPoppy: @J0LLYR0GER that's not how autism works... autism is something you are born with
[1:59:23] sabiirox: heartsteal lux will never be poopy kaypAnnoyed
[1:59:26] k0t10n: kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya kaypFreya
[1:59:27] Jaguar542: THAT! what I like about you KayPea LuvHearts
[1:59:42] k0t10n: so obsessed
[1:59:45] VamPoppy: sorry meant to reply to padam
[1:59:54] RowdyRoran: i made a tiktok account to see memes and it gave me a UFO + car crash + cops arresting people algorithm? ??? deleted my account after 2 weeks
[2:00:04] J0LLYR0GER: @vampoppy you @ the wrong person  I didnt mention autism
[2:00:12] via_trita: i think she just pathed the walls and turret range to cut you off if you went toward bush
[2:00:20] ArchitectMason: @kaypea she walked above in the alcove and hugged the wall to get around. only way
[2:00:25] sovitiaisavampire: i only have an instagram account to follow KP
[2:00:26] padampadamm: @vampoppy not entirely. Research suggests that autism develops from a combination of genetic and nongenetic, or environmental, influences.
[2:00:35] yanjii: the day i donwload tik tok its the end of the world
[2:00:54] padampadamm: so if youre predisposed for autism, some things will push you in the direction
[2:01:09] Rincewurst: isnt that the whole gist of it? the viewer doenst care what they watch. Brain is off and content is consumed mindlessly
[2:01:25] J0LLYR0GER: She knows with Riven they can just farm you at this point. So rather than actually doing stuffo n the map shes camping top
[2:01:32] rmvfrostbite: hey! hope your games are going well ❤️😁
[2:01:34] ArchitectMason: yep, her invisible range is so weird
[2:01:41] Jaguar542: Naughty Evelyn.  pekeasARA pekeasARA
[2:01:50] lewhitehd69: god damn kids these days
[2:02:02] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea At the end of the day its not the fault of the technology its shitty parenting unfortunately
[2:02:03] Martybggg: It also feels like it's addicting you to the point where you don't realise how much time has passed ever since your start scrolling and you just wanna keep scrolling over and over and over again
[2:02:04] VamPoppy: @padampadamm no dude, that's very incorrect, look it up
[2:02:26] padampadamm: @vampoppy literally copypasted that from autismspeaks.org lol
[2:02:44] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea Ur also not really worth much gold at this point. They are actually just waisting time and resources
