[2:14:02] Mr_Tav: imagine the world where DK is impo and he pre-jacks lights and dies first
[2:14:03] xGunny: also an option to move vitals to labs (which makes sense) but doesnt look like they have it on
[2:14:30] blueamyr: @xGunny on the death valley node?
[2:14:49] blueamyr: I prefer vitals in labs
[2:14:50] xGunny: @blueamyr it will be right under death valley node. Makes people go there more often for better kill places
[2:15:10] blueamyr: split vitals from admin
[2:15:34] kkHarvy: u cant reveal?
