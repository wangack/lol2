[1:35:54] RedSundowner: What is this Stardew Valley looking game
[1:36:19] fiat_soup: I just realized. This is the last riot forge game, so my hopes on a fiddle horror game are gone PoroSad
[1:36:35] RedSundowner: Riot Forge stole Stardew Valley's essence and said "Yep, it's fire"
[1:37:01] Natmad_1: horror game in the shadow isle could have been great
[1:37:34] Kronk_Code: imagine they made a Sentinel Doom game where your just in the Shadow Isles with Doom music killing everything
[1:38:45] fiat_soup: @kronk_code that would be awesome
[1:39:00] Natmad_1: shooting ghouls in a VR game as lucian, like in the cinematics
[1:39:14] Kronk_Code: @fiat_soup ye Riot needs to hire me fr
[1:40:22] BroomNasty: This game reminds me of final fantasy tactics for some reason
[1:40:49] Marjonxxxx: AIGHT AM BACK ARE WE STILL HERE?
[1:41:03] Animus258: riot forge had great potentian, but since it was all outside riot, it could have tranished the brand as a whole
[1:41:50] Marjonxxxx: @Animus258 yeah we can't expect good stuff from riot now Kappa
[1:42:18] randomeme0: are you just jackin it? HUH

[1:59:30] Onigiriman: w8 for Shadowverse 2
[2:00:02] KamenPurin: KamenPurin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Snnuy! Haven't really been on twitch lately, nor consuming lor content. But my prime is still yours lol

[2:00:36] K4nataa: K4nataa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! I double down on what Kamen said.
[2:01:00] KamenPurin: I play poc every now and then

[2:01:20] fiat_soup: Idk, for me POC feels kinda repetitive
[2:01:28] KamenPurin: Used to play on mobile while I was not on my PC
[2:01:41] KamenPurin: but this mobile time has been filled with tft now snnuyKEK
[2:01:47] kzr99: can you leak when they going to drop the new poc adventure
[2:02:01] Tetravus: How is this game?
[2:02:01] SalixPendragon: I don't rly play LoR I just like to use your totally meta decks from time to time Kappa
[2:02:13] A_Name_That_Isnt_Taken: essaying
[2:02:14] Sengokura: can we take a look at the essay?
[2:02:49] RagelessStream: they kinda cracked the code with mounthlies imo but the problem with that its that just once a mounth content variation
[2:03:08] A_Name_That_Isnt_Taken: i honestly would like ways to downgrade champs temporarly so i could do like lower tier adventures with certain champs again
[2:03:13] dragomaster2422: among us water bottle
[2:03:34] SalixPendragon: like, take inspiration from the mechanics of Slay the spire?
[2:04:04] kzr99: start deck changes would be good
[2:04:20] tacosir: i like the idea of having a choice between two different champ specific powers
[2:05:21] SalixPendragon: bring expeditions back Kappa
[2:05:23] fiat_soup: I think choosing the adventure is kinda lame if they are the same every single time
[2:05:27] MuthMonster: they could make it so you can build your deck, maybe 40 cards with a max of 6 champions. then you face off against a real person who has also created their own deck. .
[2:05:56] RagelessStream: its espaicly true because poc players are not playing for deck building really
[2:06:23] SalixPendragon: what about adding somthing like the victory laps from The binding of isaac?
[2:06:37] Sengokura: @muthmonster thats so funny lmao
[2:07:15] afuwuc: Do u make ur own yordle?
[2:07:19] Marshall_K: You enjoying the game @Snnuy ?
[2:07:38] SalixPendragon: victory laps are when you finish your run, but you can start again from the beginning while keeping your items

[2:51:57] PedroCasal: yeah but its unfair to compare anything to stardew tbh
[2:52:44] afuwuc: idk man y'all say stardew is really good but there's no asol in that game
