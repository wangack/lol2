[10:25:34] Arrianna: I was considering a bedjet lol
[10:25:35] Akumaunit00: that will help with my raynards
[10:25:50] Derrickster: I couldn't do a water cooled bed. I was in bed last night under two blankets and was getting pissed because there was a small gap letting cold air in
[10:25:51] Jukari101: I meant for controlling the temperature, but yeah.
[10:25:59] Jukari101: I could use that for sure.

[10:30:20] Azhrein: i always wanted to try the purple
[10:30:24] Azhrein: cuz the pillow is super comf
[10:30:25] mollyeatsfood: I didn't get the water cooling thing, Ven. It's just a cooling mattress by itself. @Venalis
[10:30:43] TedPandaParty: did they ever go back on their required subscription?
[10:30:43] DudeJoeyAwesome: hot damn that is pricey.
[10:30:45] TheRealSgtViper: i need the medium so i dont sink into it but im also a furnace at night so i need something
[10:30:55] BossHulio: We like firm matresses because we already have the fluff.
[10:31:00] smokin_smedley: all you youngsters with your bidets and water cooled mattresses.  Back in my day…
[10:31:05] Azhrein: 2020 i believe
[10:31:06] Derrickster: it was awhile ago, ya. I forgot about it

[10:32:34] Noshtzy: Sexy kinda
[10:33:07] Derrickster: NODDERS
[10:33:08] TheRealSgtViper: gathering sim
[10:33:13] ScaryFast: It rocks
[10:33:13] FaerlyGay: I'm glad I run cold in my sleep over running hot, I cannot deal with waking up damp.
[10:33:21] iselwen: perfect stream for breakfast
[10:33:25] Azhrein: not impressed with the game itself
[10:33:28] Azhrein: but enjoying chatting
[10:33:48] randomchef1: wtf…I logged off Twitch hours ago thinking the stream was ending. I suck
[10:34:00] Craftyoldgoat: @iselwen ashleyWave
[10:34:00] FaerlyGay: I'm thinking I might vibe because I will spend 50+ hours just gathering and vibing when I'm alone.
[10:34:08] mollyeatsfood: I've woken up damp with sweat once and had NO IDEA why. Hasn't happened since
[10:34:08] iselwen: enjoying first coffee :)
[10:34:32] smokin_smedley: probably the first few missions
[10:34:51] TheRealSgtViper: experience Kappa
[10:35:17] BossHulio: Body Toxicity.... what was that?
[10:35:17] jzimmah: Bad UI ruins games for me
[10:35:23] FaerlyGay: I just hope the first week isn't everyone being mostly radio silent setting up bases and such, then moving into the war waging/territory expansion stage.
[10:35:32] Jukari101: It's pretty bad imo.
[10:35:55] BossHulio: Helldivers 2 has me hooked.
[10:36:02] mollyeatsfood: the UI looks like a nightmare
[10:36:37] ussdefiant60: 500-square mile Purebred Horse stables coming up.
[10:36:48] FaerlyGay: That was a juicy thump. Did you fire that at mach 3?
[10:36:59] smokin_smedley: yeah Ark was no RP and all building for some time
[10:37:09] anxiousdevil5: the amount of damage that just instantly killed that animal versus the damage that was tickling the wolf is insane
[10:37:18] Peterclark26: Is there lore behind this roleplay server or just 'go and roleplay'
[10:37:46] FaerlyGay: Respect each other, find a good balance.
[10:37:48] TheRealSgtViper: the testing will this be the new RP game or not
[10:37:56] SirLurksABot: Incase Twitch explodes, I'm also streaming over here! Multi-Streaming to my Youtube! https://www.youtube.com/venalis/live

[10:38:14] jzimmah: commercials peepoClap
[10:38:23] smokin_smedley: @peterclark26 are you going to play this?  I miss your sass
[10:39:51] Peterclark26: Oh I dont care so much about rules, Im talking about plot. I  dont do totally sandbox roleplay servers as a rule cuz they need a glue to get people motivated to interact.
[10:41:01] TheRealSgtViper: Flemington did it

[10:42:55] Peterclark26: If we review all of Darksides great successes they all had a framework - Atlas was centered around Pirates Privateers Navy and Civillians. Darksides most successful ARK season was based around three factions. Outside of Darkside most roleplay is setting based too.
[10:44:19] Akumaunit00: KEKW
[10:44:22] jzimmah: LUL
[10:44:25] RedIrish4Life: haha
[10:44:34] FaerlyGay: I never heard of Myth of Empires until today, but Darksides record of good RP was enough to sell me on it.
[10:45:06] Firebain: How's the game thus far?
[10:45:20] smokin_smedley: still no walls
[10:45:24] Soggy_SheetStain: Soggy_SheetStain subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Hello, this is a resub message: WEEEOOOEEEEOOOOEEE! This concludes the resub message.
[10:45:25] Firebain: Oh ouch
[10:45:28] FaerlyGay: The walls will come with time!
[10:46:23] Peterclark26: Thats fair, and I've never touched MOE myself either. Figuring out how the games mechanics are best used is fine as long as people know what it is. Most immediately this strikes me as a game that would best work with something like two rival empires with smaller independents like bandits and merchants
[10:46:23] iPissOatmeal: ctrl t hides chat
[10:46:24] FaerlyGay: Menu Simulator 2024
[10:46:32] Firebain: OK I am not smart enough for these micro manging menues
[10:46:46] Frostdzzt: So wheres the problem, @Venalis
[10:46:51] jzimmah: venaBooli
[10:46:52] TheRealSgtViper: ill just watch XD too much for me
[10:46:57] Soggy_SheetStain: I'm naming my kid "Withina Menu"
[10:47:01] hoju_the_elder: All these menus are making me hungry
[10:47:02] Arrianna: I like menus
[10:47:14] ScaryFast: moanus
[10:47:20] Akumaunit00: HE ALREADY DIED,
[10:47:25] Akumaunit00: STOP KILLING HIM KEKW
[10:47:29] mollyeatsfood: take a drink every time Ven says menu
[10:47:36] Firebain: My brain hurts
[10:47:37] FaerlyGay: We would die.
[10:47:44] Raveneth: so are you gonna afk exp grind or what
[10:47:53] DWDuckers: Menu Simulator 2024!!!
[10:47:57] Khreegor: 2x
[10:48:11] Traece: It does indeed.
[10:48:15] jzimmah: SFX are... something...
[10:48:17] mollyeatsfood: take a shot every time he says menu *
[10:48:47] Onikaji: i never realized how sexual bow hunting could sound
[10:48:49] Firebain: Sounds squishy
[10:48:50] FaerlyGay: I sure love the sound of biting into a super juicy apple when I shoot things.
[10:48:57] iPissOatmeal: ctrl t hides chat @Venalis
[10:49:10] anxiousdevil5: the sfx would be fine if it actually originated at what you hit instead of in your ears
[10:49:16] iPissOatmeal: fair enough LUL
[10:49:26] jzimmah: How many arrows can this bitch take?
[10:49:34] Blitz9201: lol
[10:49:37] Firebain: Sounds like you are opening the deer's rib cage.
[10:49:44] Blitz9201: its takes about 10 arrows to take down a deer
[10:50:06] Blitz9201: sometimes mores
[10:50:07] hoju_the_elder: Any word on how the modding potential is?
[10:50:20] FaerlyGay: Could be a breath of fresh air away from Atlas.
[10:50:22] TheRealSgtViper: it seems a little less janky than atlas i suppose
[10:52:08] Firebain: Oh crap. Sleep is actually a thing in some places.
[10:52:17] GeneralTso09: I'm gone for 20 mins and still no walls..... LUL
[10:52:58] GeneralTso09: oh a few walls
[10:53:58] VidTer: maybe he did
[10:54:04] GeneralTso09: god damn, got 'em
[10:54:11] smokin_smedley: yes walls facing the most formidable opponent, the lake
[10:54:37] GeneralTso09: they wake up your son, then Flynn starts barking
[10:56:00] Firebain: oh no
[10:56:14] FaerlyGay: The baobao alarms.
[10:56:24] shoudo_: my dog does something like that he whines and sounds hurt lol
[10:56:59] jzimmah: LUL
[10:57:18] shoudo_: i feel that insomnia sucks
