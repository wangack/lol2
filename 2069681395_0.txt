[1:38:49] sorrobou: @Lazynameross true story
[1:39:56] dreaminks: get fh mby?
[1:40:32] Lazynameross: fh vs q spammers?
[1:40:39] Onezike: is teemo ad the way to go this season?
[1:41:11] dreaminks: really good vs veigo, ez is more aa oriented than just q spam, and also decent vs riven
[1:41:30] dreaminks: the team also need frontline
[1:41:57] Lazynameross: this not tanky game but i see
[1:43:33] dreaminks: but now no one can facecheck you don't have frontline and onehit still mostly magic dmg? no?
[1:44:38] dreaminks: just wondering
[1:44:57] dreaminks: cuz i don't see how you aa their team with their range either
[1:45:03] dreaminks: but mby just jgl gap
[1:47:43] Lazynameross: jg otp clueless on anything not lillia it seems according to stats
[1:47:45] dreaminks: his gank top was really questionable :)
[1:49:13] dreaminks: seems fine pathing so far
[1:49:49] softygold: TE AMO IPAV
[1:53:13] dreaminks: he did know? he dodge the bush?
[1:53:32] dreaminks: same for the riven coming to blue no?
[1:53:44] softygold: play urf
[1:54:24] green_edible_bleach: there is urf?
[1:54:29] dreaminks: he was either top or base?
[1:54:37] dreaminks: since fid did bot gank
[1:55:00] dreaminks: then why he don't go
[1:55:28] dreaminks: then he would stay top for invade
[1:55:33] dreaminks: since bot gank=
[1:55:33] softygold: @green_edible_bleach yes
[1:55:34] dreaminks: ?
[1:56:07] dreaminks: sry got ad
[1:56:09] dreaminks: didn't hear
[1:57:07] dreaminks: nope
[1:57:18] dreaminks: ggot ad didn't see
[1:58:04] dreaminks: don't agree
[1:58:55] dreaminks: ?
[1:59:00] dreaminks: it doens't work like that
[1:59:13] dreaminks: and it was first 3 min?
[1:59:19] dreaminks: that's first clear?
[1:59:37] dreaminks: what
[2:00:04] hassyownz: yh i hes right
[2:00:07] hassyownz: i ping
[2:00:10] hassyownz: when i think
[2:00:12] hassyownz: they are grubs
[2:00:15] hassyownz: im jungle main
[2:00:21] dreaminks: but why would he not help bot with first clear? so you can "assume" he goes top invade or started bot
[2:00:37] dreaminks: if he started bot
[2:00:39] dreaminks: *
[2:01:12] dreaminks: fk started top*
[2:01:16] dreaminks: can't type
[2:01:42] dreaminks: this is completely different?
[2:02:23] dreaminks: so now you will know that he will go botside afterwards
[2:04:17] quetzalcozy: Hi Mr. Ipav. I hope your games have been going well, Smiley Face :)

[2:20:31] dreaminks: or base
[2:20:36] dreaminks: now
[2:20:59] dreaminks: so where should i be then
[2:21:03] dreaminks: he*
[2:21:14] dreaminks: he can only be topside
[2:21:18] dreaminks: or on way to topside
[2:21:53] dreaminks: yes doesn't change the fact that he can't be elsewhere
[2:22:00] dreaminks: then topside
[2:22:04] dreaminks: or on his way topside
[2:22:17] dreaminks: then he should be base
[2:22:21] dreaminks: that's what i'm saying
[2:22:24] dreaminks: topside or base
[2:22:32] dreaminks: no
[2:22:35] Docelo: i just join, why is this replay @ipav999
[2:22:39] dreaminks: he can only be topside or base atm
[2:22:47] dreaminks: hge can't be bot
[2:23:18] Docelo: arguing stream ew
[2:23:23] dreaminks: cuz nothing to get
[2:23:27] dreaminks: at bot
[2:23:37] dreaminks: fid
[2:23:41] dreaminks: and 2 botlaners
[2:23:46] dreaminks: he cna't contest
[2:23:49] dreaminks: he cna't be there
[2:23:52] dreaminks: no
[2:23:55] dreaminks: not in time
[2:24:10] dreaminks: he cannot contest scuttle

[2:24:34] dreaminks: 2v3
[2:25:02] dreaminks: 2v4 if sera sacrifice
[2:25:22] Lazynameross: how many times has outnumbered fight happened at grubs
[2:25:25] dreaminks: they also lose bot wave
[2:25:27] dreaminks: if they help
[2:25:29] Lazynameross: why not scuttle
[2:25:30] dreaminks: so not good at all
[2:25:36] dreaminks: so still worth for you guys
[2:25:55] dreaminks: i'm not saying 100%
[2:26:06] dreaminks: since you havn't seen him
[2:26:13] dreaminks: but most likely
[2:26:20] dreaminks: you can assume he is topside
[2:26:21] dreaminks: or base atm
[2:26:33] dreaminks: ofc
[2:26:37] dreaminks: it's like 95%
[2:26:47] dreaminks: what'
[2:26:59] dreaminks: he can only get stuff top
[2:27:04] dreaminks: so he should be topside
[2:27:20] dreaminks: you don't know
[2:27:27] dreaminks: no clue
[2:27:42] dreaminks: sure
[2:28:01] dreaminks: ye
[2:28:13] dreaminks: yes
[2:28:17] dreaminks: then he should be base
[2:28:22] dreaminks: cuz he cant' contest
[2:28:28] dreaminks: since bot lost
[2:28:32] krozarotk1: Q again like a man
[2:28:41] dreaminks: they can still win 2v3
[2:29:03] dreaminks: then they lose
[2:29:04] dreaminks: wave
[2:29:10] dreaminks: and you are still winnnign
[2:29:56] dreaminks: i'm not to sure about that but you will know as soon as he see scuttle been taken either way
[2:30:27] dreaminks: well i don't agree
[2:30:33] dreaminks: since you think tthey can 2v3
[2:30:36] dreaminks: and i think not
[2:31:03] dreaminks: have all sums?
[2:31:11] dreaminks: heal shield
[2:31:17] dreaminks: fid fear
[2:31:23] matheusgusmao00: samira doesn't have mana tough
[2:31:27] matheusgusmao00: though
[2:31:28] dreaminks: no way he can just flash stun
[2:32:03] dreaminks: well we don't agree so
[2:32:07] dreaminks: don't know what to say
[2:32:21] dreaminks: but now i know what you think
[2:32:46] matheusgusmao00: I believe in you ipav
[2:32:46] dreaminks: but when he see scuttle
[2:32:49] dreaminks: taken here?
[2:32:56] dreaminks: you know already
[2:32:58] dreaminks: that he is top
[2:33:08] dreaminks: bro
[2:33:10] dreaminks: don't say that
[2:33:12] velcotan: even if they could do something, every adc in the world is basing there or get fkd on tempo
[2:33:19] 10cmHurts: I agree with Ipav
[2:33:35] dreaminks: then he is janna?
[2:33:38] dreaminks: or samira?
[2:34:13] dreaminks: i don't think so
[2:34:22] dreaminks: just they can't contest
[2:34:40] dreaminks: since one roation of hwei and he can't do anything for 10 s
[2:34:47] dreaminks: full hp?
[2:35:01] dreaminks: didn't hear sry
[2:35:05] velcotan: it doesnt even matter if they win or not. their bot is never staying. they will ruin their own lane rofl
[2:35:07] dreaminks: if full hp?
[2:35:18] dochello: dochello subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[2:35:35] jordyutopia: e q + q q + w e from hwei they're ded
[2:35:44] jordyutopia: yeah combo is too long ^ kek
[2:36:28] Mr_Mirlo: So bot should push lane and contest and make red choose between fight or lose cs?
[2:37:12] GrekoPL: Please move on
[2:37:31] dreaminks: but if you fast forward 5 s
[2:37:37] dreaminks: and see scutlle taken
[2:37:42] dreaminks: you know 100% he is topside
[2:37:48] jordyutopia: actually at this spot, we don't know where he is
[2:37:48] softygold: te amo ipac
[2:37:50] softygold: :v
[2:37:57] jordyutopia: we need info
[2:38:47] GrekoPL: If Fiddle see him we know where he is
[2:39:28] YolkBun: ipavNoted
[2:39:34] dreaminks: wait sera can actually come aswell
[2:39:39] dreaminks: since she can just tp
[2:39:41] dreaminks: after
[2:39:54] dreaminks: so 2v4
[2:40:47] dreaminks: but whole thing here is that when fid see scutlle taken botside
[2:40:55] dreaminks: you can assume again he is topside or base
[2:41:53] dreaminks: but you should assume he is in little pixel bush
[2:41:55] dreaminks: atm
[2:42:40] jordyutopia: i would never follow that, seems way to sus she walking that way
[2:42:42] dreaminks: and same thing when you die to riven and veigo later as well
[2:43:00] dreaminks: also very unfortunate since you had 300 gold bounty
[2:43:20] Mr_Mirlo: @jordyutopia This yea.
[2:43:41] dreaminks: you can assume
[2:43:42] dreaminks: that's all
[2:43:44] dreaminks: assume
[2:44:02] dreaminks: but that's not majority
[2:44:08] dreaminks: it's more likely he is topside
[2:44:10] dreaminks: right
[2:44:13] dreaminks: more likely
[2:44:17] Mr_Mirlo: True but riven pathing is sketchy af. Shes being smacked, so needs to walk to safety. Why not walk to tower?
[2:44:55] jordyutopia: that's why we love league, there's so many possibilities <3
[2:45:14] Mr_Mirlo: What motivations could riven have to move there?
[2:45:21] dreaminks: so you literally coiintoss it
[2:45:26] dreaminks: and just give it to chancew
[2:45:32] dreaminks: you said it yourself
[2:45:35] dreaminks: nah
[2:45:57] dreaminks: this is what gave veigo his way to win
[2:46:07] dreaminks: he was dodgin bush
[2:46:19] dreaminks: he was waiting for it since crab
[2:46:21] dreaminks: aswell
[2:46:30] dreaminks: you can assume
[2:46:33] dreaminks: OFC
[2:46:47] YolkBun: MYAAA
[2:46:49] dreaminks: but nah
[2:47:17] dreaminks: well i don't agree with you at all but i see that you took a chance
[2:47:17] jordyutopia: i've seen that on a lot of avg joe junglers, they don't ping where enemy jg might be doing
[2:47:25] dreaminks: and it didn't workl out
[2:48:03] dreaminks: he's early game pathing was fine
[2:48:07] dreaminks: was good
[2:48:16] jordyutopia: i played only once with a challenger top tier jg, he was smurfing they guy pinged literally everything XDD
[2:49:10] dreaminks: then why take chance
[2:49:15] dreaminks: if it is 50/50
[2:49:38] dreaminks: you said you took 50/50
[2:49:49] dreaminks: but now not 50/50
[2:49:59] jordyutopia: @dreaminks if he got lucky there he was going to be madly ahead of riven
[2:50:15] dreaminks: and if he was unlucky he was madly behindf?
[2:50:20] dreaminks: nope
[2:50:48] dreaminks: no but same thing about riven going to blue then
[2:50:50] dreaminks: no?
[2:51:13] dreaminks: don't agree at all
[2:51:29] dreaminks: i said it before
[2:51:30] dreaminks: asweell
[2:51:36] 514484: still talking about this KEKW
[2:51:37] dreaminks: you read what you want to read
[2:51:39] dreaminks: that's all
[2:51:56] dreaminks: i understand the difference
[2:52:10] dreaminks: but it's same thing when you have someone don't reacting to it
[2:52:12] dreaminks: and not pinging
[2:52:17] dreaminks: you did same thing
[2:52:19] dreaminks: as he
[2:52:37] dreaminks: yes it's obv
[2:52:39] dreaminks: he is topside
[2:52:41] dreaminks: or base
[2:52:47] YolkBun: post opgg peepoRiot
[2:52:54] kuma_0_4: what is happening?
[2:53:08] dreaminks: for me it's 95%
[2:53:12] dreaminks: he is topside or base
[2:53:15] dreaminks: atm
[2:53:36] dreaminks: earlier
[2:53:53] whuazgoodnjaggah: dreaminks always easy to make calls in hindsight
[2:53:58] dreaminks: i did
[2:54:07] dreaminks: during game @whuazgoodnjaggah
[2:54:08] Pheanir: do you know that because of the ingame timer and jungle clear path for Viego? @dreaminks
[2:54:29] dreaminks: yes but he is not reacting
[2:54:31] dreaminks: same as you
[2:54:34] dreaminks: and you don't ping
[2:54:37] dreaminks: just like he didn't
[2:54:50] dreaminks: it's obv what's going oin
[2:54:56] dreaminks: and still no ping
[2:54:57] YolkBun: what is the question here monkaHmm
[2:55:06] Pheanir: looks like fiddle didn't pay attention
[2:55:08] StayMiIked: He was not paying attention
[2:55:14] kuma_0_4: nahh that is fiddle trolling
[2:55:21] dreaminks: but you see he is not reacting
[2:55:23] dreaminks: so why not ping
[2:55:25] dreaminks: then
[2:55:26] whuazgoodnjaggah: dreaminks so you can show me a clip where you call it during the game before it happens?
[2:55:28] kuma_0_4: I'm a main fiddle and holf fear for invades all the time
[2:55:30] StayMiIked: dude is in farm mode
[2:55:31] dreaminks: that's what you are asking for him
[2:55:32] YolkBun: fiddle should be looking at lanes while taking camps
[2:55:34] Pheanir: could ALSO be that fiddle checked the map elsewhere while trying to get blue, we don't know
[2:55:56] dreaminks: no @whuazgoodnjaggah
[2:56:04] YolkBun: he should know wave state of top when on blue NODDERS
[2:56:24] StayMiIked: only explanation is that fiddle is on drugs and was ultra focused on just farming
[2:56:37] UberZanc: why are you letting this troll get to you. Move on. Bad jng is bad jng. I want to watch my fav streamer play ranked.
[2:56:39] jordyutopia: @dreaminks we can't play for others, he doesn't have any pressure, meaning you have to play safe and youre fiddle, that's fiddel misplay brother
[2:56:48] whuazgoodnjaggah: dreaminks so you're making the cal in hindsight
[2:56:51] dreaminks: ofc it's fid missplay
[2:56:58] dreaminks: just saying a ping
[2:57:02] dreaminks: like you wanted
[2:57:10] dreaminks: you should do the same
[2:57:15] dreaminks: since he not reacting
[2:57:21] kuma_0_4: fiddle should have seen it
[2:57:23] Lazynameross: you can just check chat in vods for calls
[2:57:25] kuma_0_4: needs no ping
[2:57:35] Pheanir: @dreaminks I'd say it might be a good idea to do that because you shouldn't expect your team mates to do what they should/could.
[2:57:38] StayMiIked: I played with a fiddle like this that had 3.4 million mastery points. he went like 1-6-2
[2:57:39] dreaminks: ofc he should see it
[2:57:43] dreaminks: just saying since he doesn't
[2:57:46] dreaminks: you should ping
[2:57:51] Lazynameross: they did type something but idk what
[2:57:52] dreaminks: like you should assume he is topside
[2:57:52] kuma_0_4: hahaha
[2:58:08] kuma_0_4: you can't be babied all the time
[2:58:16] YolkBun: MYAAA
[2:58:25] dreaminks: it's same thign as top play
[2:58:26] jordyutopia: he didn't have fear or r, you saying he should ping and that is ok, but it is not the same when you do know what is coming
[2:58:30] dreaminks: you should assume he is there
[2:58:33] dreaminks: so why do yo uneed ping
[2:59:12] kuma_0_4: dreaminks sounds like he is fiddle
[2:59:14] kuma_0_4: hehe
[2:59:24] dreaminks: you said it yourself it's 50/50 in your eys so you do understand he can be there
[2:59:36] dreaminks: so why do yo uneed ping
[2:59:42] Pheanir: It's a dilemma, kind of. On one hand, Fiddle should have paid attention, on the other hand one can not rely on one's team mates in ranked to 'do the right thing', so you might as well do things yourself.
[3:00:00] lackdark97: can we just say it's solo q
[3:00:01] dreaminks: @kuma_0_4 KEKW
[3:00:02] Pheanir: but that's not possible
[3:00:05] kuma_0_4: gray matter is not for sale sadly
[3:00:17] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: purpose of pings are to warn teammates end of story
[3:00:19] kuma_0_4: nah fiddle be trolling or griefing
[3:00:51] StayMiIked: in "higher" elo people should know how to play the game is the problem. ex; high plat vs bronze. your teammates suddenly have map awareness and know usual rotations and timers.
[3:01:13] kuma_0_4: true milked
[3:01:19] dreaminks: but how would you know that ?
[3:01:23] dreaminks: you have no vision
[3:01:24] Pheanir: @StayMiIked absolutely agree. they SHOULD know
[3:01:27] dreaminks: right
[3:01:36] dreaminks: same counter
[3:01:37] dreaminks: as you
[3:01:44] kuma_0_4: hahaha
[3:01:54] kuma_0_4: dreaminks you tripping
[3:02:28] jordyutopia: @StayMiIked ii assume that is diamond and in that elo people at least and i say at least, they see the minimap and they can know what is happening
[3:02:40] jordyutopia: right?
[3:02:40] dreaminks: he literally said if riven didn't show and then went to fid in jgl then it's his fault that he didn't ping
[3:03:20] lackdark97: if it's the same when did we see viego go to topside ? oh wait you need to assume that viego need to go top and why do you assume that well you need to be in contact with the viego in discord ^^
[3:03:32] dreaminks: exactky @lackdark97
[3:03:38] dreaminks: that' s what i've been saying
[3:03:42] StayMiIked: @jordyutopia yeah something was off. fiddle was not paying attention for whatever reason. that was bronze awareness at the end of the day. not something someone should get used to. especially in higher elo where people want to win
[3:03:45] jordyutopia: is not optimal
[3:04:09] dreaminks: i jsut said what pav bveen saying! same counter! and it doesn't work the way he says @lackdark97
[3:04:37] lackdark97: no man you cannot assume he is going to toplane unless you follow his jungle pathing and it is not the role of side laners
[3:05:00] dreaminks: why not?
[3:05:05] lackdark97: it's the jungler's to know that and communicate it to its team
[3:05:14] dreaminks: yes
[3:05:21] dreaminks: agree with last sentence
[3:05:24] Pheanir: I think it's beneficial for any role to have an understanding of the jungle timings.
[3:05:31] jordyutopia: @StayMiIked agree
[3:05:34] StayMiIked: dream you are raising my blood pressure
[3:05:44] lackdark97: dude side laners need to manage their lane and ping when their opponents are missing
[3:05:52] jordyutopia: not for noobies
[3:05:52] qtzzu: ipavSip
[3:05:58] YolkBun: peepoCuteEatACookie
[3:06:20] IAmJusticex3: didnt u also type in chat that riven was coming or am i thinking of a different play
[3:06:45] lackdark97: but it's solo q you cant be 100 % precise in communications unless you are in voice with others
[3:07:00] dreaminks: yes but whole thing was that you couldn't know that veigo was topside unless fid tells you and i disagree. since there is so many indicators to why he was most likely topside
[3:07:15] Pheanir: not having vision =/= not paying attention
[3:07:17] StayMiIked: this is why dota 2 has voice coms for game chat (dont need party)
[3:07:42] StayMiIked: also for expert level flaming
[3:07:54] dreaminks: wasn't 4-5 min
[3:07:57] dreaminks: was first clear
[3:08:03] dreaminks: which is telegraphed
[3:08:06] lackdark97: @dreaminks it's a 5v5 game you cannot track everyone alone you need others
[3:08:09] dreaminks: and you see bot scuttle taken
[3:08:22] dreaminks: you can track everyoine
[3:08:32] dreaminks: that's legit what chally's do
[3:08:35] 514484: FeelsGoodMan
[3:08:39] dreaminks: that's why he want the pings
[3:08:42] StayMiIked: new game new mental
[3:08:57] lackdark97: no man you are overestimating challengers
[3:09:00] dreaminks: ofc not
[3:09:02] dreaminks: all the time
[3:09:06] dreaminks: mistakes happens
[3:09:15] matheusgusmao00: was dreaminks at that game?
[3:09:20] dreaminks: nope
[3:09:25] Pheanir: I think the top players have a good understanding of which options their opponents have, but it's never guaranteed.
[3:09:43] matheusgusmao00: its because i missed how this discussion started
[3:09:43] dreaminks: ye never garanted
[3:09:51] dreaminks: that's why you need to assume
[3:09:54] lackdark97: if you watch some junglers streams you see they skip sometimes camps or change their pathing just to target a lane to gank
[3:10:00] dreaminks: it's
[3:10:06] dreaminks: 90% me
[3:10:07] dreaminks: in chat
[3:10:13] dreaminks: wdym
[3:10:15] 514484: D:
[3:10:21] dreaminks: well
[3:10:22] dreaminks: i will
[3:10:50] dreaminks: sry for not having 200wpm
[3:10:58] lackdark97: anyway lets enjoy the teemo gameplay ( best champ in league)
[3:11:14] YolkBun: peepoRiot
[3:11:28] dreaminks: yea man you do you
[3:11:46] dreaminks: i don't give af if you play poorly or good
[3:11:53] dreaminks: just dind't agree with you that's all
[3:13:06] dreaminks: LuL
[3:13:14] Pheanir: NotLikeThis
[3:13:20] dreaminks: ofc its my fault
[3:13:35] dreaminks: i said lots :)
[3:14:11] Pheanir: pretty chaotic game so far already
[3:14:19] sumitos: Its true stop trying to start the topic when ipav spent 100 yrs explaining before . Let him focus on the new game. That's just common courtesy.
[3:14:32] dreaminks: haven't even said anyting?
[3:14:37] 514484: KEKW
[3:14:41] kuma_0_4: ban
[3:15:08] sumitos: he means you speaking now when the original conversation has passed .
[3:15:11] LochNeiss: You're getting trolled lowkey
[3:15:12] matheusgusmao00: is there a chance that he is just trolling?
[3:15:36] kuma_0_4: @LochNeiss yup
[3:15:38] dreaminks: did i not say yes man you do you
[3:15:57] matheusgusmao00: can we just move on
[3:16:00] Pheanir: TakeNRG
[3:16:09] matheusgusmao00: move on guys
[3:16:11] kuma_0_4: he is rage baitting you
[3:16:24] matheusgusmao00: @kuma_0_4 looks like
[3:16:29] OpaqueColours: @kuma_0_4 and it's working LUL
[3:16:39] dreaminks: what i say?
[3:16:45] H1kar1Yam1: H1kar1Yam1 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:17:06] sumitos: @dreaminks just stop it  already. we move onto this game now.
[3:17:11] YolkBun: bonkCat
[3:17:28] dreaminks: i'm not even talking about it @sumitos
[3:17:30] Pheanir: how to Taimo against Fiora with advantage?
[3:18:29] H1kar1Yam1: ipavClown ipavClown
[3:20:43] jordyutopia: I have a question for you chat. So enemy jg start with no leash, the laner should know where the enemy jg is after one play at botside where he was not even spotted?
[3:21:36] matheusgusmao00: global taunt in action
[3:21:57] sumitos: is it useful to get Randuin Omen to slow her movements so she can't position herself to tag you when she engages on you or not worth it?
[3:22:26] Pheanir: @jordyutopia I'd say it depends on the jungle champion to make a more likely assumption about where they are, but you cannot actually *know*.
[3:22:35] dreaminks: @jordyutopia don't know if you were here but he was spotted since bot crab was taken
[3:23:04] RoyalWeasel23: why are u not taking free blue buff?
[3:23:56] matheusgusmao00: I created a new acc only to play teemo, but I guess league put me in the smurf queue. I lack top lane xperience, it takes 20 min queue just to get wrecked and raged, it's so hard  ipavCrying
[3:24:47] jordyutopia: @Pheanir basically 50/50 that is kinda what is, an assumption, might be, might not be here
[3:25:08] Pheanir: @jordyutopia exactly
[3:25:08] matheusgusmao00: 1 little mistake costs my entire games
[3:25:17] chuuu: twitch chat i need y'alls opinion :3

[3:28:00] chuuu: mister ipav you can just do /deafen
[3:28:02] 514484: D:
[3:28:41] dreaminks: or say stop instead of engaging
[3:28:44] sumitos: totally had nothing to do with the entire enemy team coming for your furry ass as well.
[3:28:46] Plundertaker: @chuuu you never asked a question lol?
