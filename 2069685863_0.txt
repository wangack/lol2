[0:55:39] Deceiver_euw: Capybara it is wednesday my dudes
[0:55:43] swisslion2806: @snekbityou well if you want to climb go play different champs that are meta however if you have one champ that you like become an otp or a main anyone can get to challanger any way they want if thats the end goal
[0:55:51] snekbityou: @yonemain666 idk i've had games going 0/6 to a giga darius otp then smash his ass 1V1 champ is pretty much broken
[0:56:05] Wind_The: but playing meta champs is not a good way to climb btw
