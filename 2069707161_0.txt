[0:46:07] thedreadfulgamer64: @peterphii3 atoms have discreet energy levels. You give them the energy to go up a level (with electricity/heat). Then atoms go back to a stable energy level. In doing so they release energy in the form of photons
[0:46:11] neverlandx3: found the mentos
[0:46:19] n4vy_shadow: how hard is it to climb as a Mordekaiser onetrick?
