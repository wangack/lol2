[6:20:56] Synastar: @pobelter do you think Trista’s kit is a bit overloaded?
[6:21:13] smellofdog: tristana is fine its just shes problematic as a midlaner
[6:21:14] SoulOfASunbro: youve convinced me to buy this game...
[6:21:18] MageWrecker: does this game require knowledge of actual poker?
[6:21:19] smellofdog: her kit rlly isnt overloaded
[6:21:58] kumakewie: shes just another adc
[6:22:00] joco1405: What does snowball means
[6:22:07] smellofdog: man when is the last time they made a GOOD jungler, i thought KSANTE  would be able to, then NAFIRI but like seriously i dont remember the last time i had a decent fun jungler to play...
[6:22:08] christiawn: i have no idea wtf is happening
[6:22:15] kumakewie: @joco1405 when she gets ahead she pushes her lead really well
[6:22:23] Gold_Pinch: @Pobelter you are by far my favorite Eugene variant
[6:22:25] smellofdog: i swear riot hq doesnt have a single jungler in it
[6:22:35] smellofdog: like name a single jungler that was released last season
[6:22:36] kumakewie: @smellofdog wym briar
[6:22:36] joco1405: @kumakewie ooh tyyy
[6:22:36] Expryz: did i see you playing rimworld recently @Pobelter
[6:22:44] smellofdog: briar is literally warwick 2.0
[6:22:45] Jerkreb: thoughts on anivia?

[6:23:15] Cougar_Life: Okayge
[6:23:21] Gold_Pinch: @Pobelter you are by far my favorite Eugene variant
[6:23:30] honeymustard91: @smellofdog viego probably is the most recent strong jungler they released? maybe im missing someone
[6:23:30] theworldserpent01: im only emerald i dont have a queue game
[6:23:36] kumakewie: @smellofdog oh well warwick and briar are both viable champions to play so idk whay you want riot to do also no other jg has a global ult like briar this is is just your opinon
[6:23:48] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 yeah i would agree on that, but viego is like 2 years ago or more! its crazy
[6:24:00] theArambulance: Is balatro pobelter approved?
[6:24:05] 0xBufu: is this solitaire?
[6:24:07] grantthered: You can use them now
[6:24:07] smellofdog: @kumakewie i mean i main Lee sin, when is the last time a high tempo high apm jungler was made
[6:24:10] cultofaiden: you can use them in blinds when they’re most optimal
[6:24:12] theworldserpent01: riot needs to release a support tbh
[6:24:22] honeymustard91: old junglers are still better than anything new imo, nothing new will beat lee and nid to me
[6:24:23] smellofdog: they were gonna make nafiri a jungler, she was based of a conecept called Omen. long time back. then she comes out entirely different
[6:24:27] smellofdog: they literally dont make any jungler
[6:24:29] cantkillskill1: you can use the tarot cards in the top right when you open a pack @pobelter
[6:24:34] grantthered: @Pobelter You can use them while looking at tarot shop
[6:24:40] forbiddenanimegirl: is this game good?
[6:24:47] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 exactly. its because there are no junglers are riot anymore. so we dont get any champs like used to eb
[6:24:58] Afrobot: flush
[6:25:00] killshotalpha1: flush
[6:25:35] LyukaEscarlate: is this online?
[6:25:39] Cougar_Life: straight build Susge
[6:25:44] Cougar_Life: single player game LyukaEscarlate
[6:25:54] havoctft: If you don't like the jugglers riots putting out you can always play ezreal jungle or something if u want but I think briars really fun and unique @smellofdog
[6:25:56] LyukaEscarlate: Nice thx buddy
[6:26:00] scooterCx: 5Head
[6:26:00] NerfKatStierChamp: @Pobelter Do you find skirmish archetypes are more effective at Diamond games?
[6:26:26] Raistek24: i dont understand anything of this game
[6:26:28] theworldserpent01: any tips for the climb from emerald to diamond
[6:26:40] smellofdog: @havoctft yeah for sure, ive jungled with every champ.  katarian zilean. some even succesfully. but thats not hte problem. briar is fine design wise. but there are literally NO junglers like Nidalee Lee sin, they just dont  get made anymore
[6:26:40] christiawn: @Raistek24 me neither :c
[6:26:46] PlzDadNotTheBelt: have you ever tried a game called stormbound?
[6:26:51] honeymustard91: @smellofdog idk if there’s a direct correlation between employee roles and champ releases, but imo regardless of what they release theyre making the game more newbie friendly for the most part so dont hold your breath for some super invade heavy jungler to come down the pipe
[6:26:51] smellofdog: a whole arc type of the role is just gone, other than certain one tricks
[6:26:53] Jamma951: oof wouldve had a royal flush
[6:27:01] crop___: welcome to why gambling is so fun!
[6:27:07] Highfivesghost: Philippines is the first region to get Vanguard on Patch 14.5!
[6:27:08] smellofdog: i think the last cool jungler they made was kindred.
[6:27:24] theworldserpent01: @smellofdog theres also bel veth
[6:27:25] smellofdog: i HATE vsing a kindred. its so horrible. cus the game shifts into high tempo. which is good. you need some variation
[6:27:30] Cougar_Life: yeah you do your favorite part about this game is the foil packs Susge
[6:27:34] smellofdog: i have junglers just fucking full clearing vs eachother and then meeting for dragon fight
[6:27:35] xpoisonousx: pobelter jungle pog
[6:27:38] NerfKatStierChamp: Whats name of the game again?
[6:27:40] Highfivesghost: can you do a pred next game
[6:27:41] smellofdog: belveth was alright but just not so cool imo
[6:27:53] honeymustard91: ah I forgot about belveth
[6:27:53] supertfsuperfan100: pobelter how do i get woman who gets pizza for me
[6:27:54] smellofdog: now kindred., sick design. sick visual good to play. game changes around her
[6:27:59] sexmonkey: thoughts on viktor rn?
[6:28:00] smellofdog: lee sin high tempo super aggro champ
[6:28:02] smellofdog: belveth is like
[6:28:02] Highfivesghost: 😘
[6:28:05] smellofdog: get herald end game
[6:28:06] joco1405: anybody watching solo leveling?
[6:28:10] honeymustard91: try playing belveth raptors invade questline
[6:28:12] smellofdog: or just dont end game and be useless compared to a lee sin
[6:28:12] ContenderQ: @f0xyjustspams Balatro
[6:28:24] smellofdog: raptor invade is doable by literally any jgler
[6:28:27] scooterCx: monkaW
[6:28:35] smellofdog: i just miss playing something fun
[6:28:36] NewBabyAyla: what is the penalty to skipping?
[6:28:36] honeymustard91: it feels much stronger on belveth
[6:28:38] kumakewie: yeah they proabbly just dont want to make champs like that anymore
[6:28:43] christiawn: !!
[6:28:43] Angemony: your lilia was crazy tho
[6:28:47] kumakewie: seeing how they keep changing the jungle role to be less unskilled
[6:28:54] Cougar_Life: widepeepoHappy cute cat
[6:28:57] cars0n727: xdd
[6:28:58] the_tozo: why play this game now? did it come out of early access?
[6:29:08] honeymustard91: yeah jungle champs like nidalee are in the past
[6:29:10] smellofdog: @kumakewie theyre perma nerfing jungle because laners are too bad at the game nowadays
[6:29:11] Cougar_Life: can you even jungle like that in chall?
[6:29:16] Highfivesghost: don’t forget to gank
[6:29:27] smellofdog: @kumakewie its so hard to carry as jungle compared to carrying as top
[6:29:27] ContenderQ: @the_tozo full released this week
[6:29:27] Cougar_Life: !newrule MadgeLate
[6:29:27] Nightbot: Pob will quit out of his game when champ select starts Clueless
[6:29:29] smellofdog: its actually so sad
[6:29:40] kumakewie: @smellofdog they also just made it easier to clear camps for no reason that used to be a  lot more of a skill check
[6:29:44] FearSide5: what do you think of junglers that full clear base full clear base in your games pob
[6:29:44] wafflemachine27: What abt full clear tax mid?
[6:29:44] vvill: full clear base is a vibe
[6:29:47] veskit_: Is the new patch up in NA?
[6:29:48] smellofdog: i think the worst roles atm are jungle and adc. if u play more roles than 1 its no reason going as jungle or adc over queuing top mid sup
[6:29:51] honeymustard91: unironically the most recent jungler they released was the rell rework lol, and thats sort of how it is
[6:30:00] Cruzerthebruzer: monkaW
[6:30:01] scooterCx: PepeLaugh
[6:30:12] smellofdog: @kumakewie they keep changing those things but they dont matter. they literally changed entire map so that you cant gnak
[6:30:12] Cougar_Life: bro skipped the wrong blind Clueless
[6:30:20] NerfKatStierChamp: Damn if only the game was F2P
[6:30:25] theworldserpent01: @smellofdog L take jungle is so strong
[6:30:27] smellofdog: if they want less ganking they should make countger invading more rewarding. but they literally do the opposite
[6:30:44] smellofdog: @theworldserpent01 mate i literally play 10 games on fresh acc and i outpeak you 20x stop trying
[6:30:55] CJ4477: gambles??
[6:30:59] Angemony: Pob jng is lo key what I watch for
[6:30:59] honeymustard91: @smellofdog mind me asking what elo you play on?
[6:31:04] kumakewie: yeahn i just mean the general direction of the changes seems to be geared towards making the jungle role worse and more unskilled
[6:31:08] CJ4477: Channel Point Gambles?
[6:31:12] smellofdog: jungle is the strongest role just like the queen is the strongest piece of a chess board. its just the position. the xp gain and impact is so much worse than it used to be
[6:31:16] I3lackbird: @smellofdog silver player talking like a pro OMEGALUL
[6:31:17] smellofdog: im 200 lp master currently
[6:31:20] kumakewie: because they thought it was too op
[6:31:31] smellofdog: but ive been chall multiple times
[6:31:35] smellofdog: but jungle has never felt so bad to play
[6:31:42] dingplaysgames: phreak got ganked 1 too many times and said no more jungle
[6:31:53] smellofdog: jungle will always be the wildcard role but if you do ANYTHING other than fullclearing you will be put behind the enemy jungle
[6:32:07] dingplaysgames: @smellofdog ive played jungle for 7 years and it feels like absolute dog now i hate it
[6:32:19] smellofdog: if you can learn any other role., you carry easier with any other role
[6:32:27] honeymustard91: this season i agree, jungle feels a bit weird compared to past because of new map and new objective
[6:32:39] smellofdog: jungle is the hardest role and also the strongest just on the map. but jungle is not OP its literally the lowest winrate role
[6:32:50] zerodatman420: jungle Pobelter ?! cool
[6:32:52] Cruzerthebruzer: good start
[6:32:54] Cougar_Life: PepeLaugh this guy
[6:32:56] adip0: KEKW
[6:32:59] cars0n727: KEKW
[6:32:59] EgyptianOverlord: good speed so far
[6:33:01] CannonmanG: it's so joever go next
[6:33:04] honeymustard91: but if the issue you have is with jungle champs then thats been a problem for a really long time tbh
[6:33:15] supertfsuperfan100: I thought your game was full clearing pob cmon man.....
[6:33:18] Highfivesghost: if the enemy jungler is stream sniping
[6:33:34] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 its the most  team dependent role. least rewarding in gold. lowest xp gains. and its the one role were if enemy wants to play around their jgl and your team doesnt you auto lose
[6:33:48] Nightbot: subscribe to my TikTok BatChest tiktok.com/@pobelter
[6:34:01] Cougar_Life: lookingR i always greed second smite for crab fight
[6:34:04] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 nah camps are fine. its just if you do anything other than full clearing. even if  you get 3 kills as opposed to full clearing enemy. he will be ahead in XP
[6:34:06] Highfivesghost: jungle is like support with smite
[6:34:11] Nightbot: Check out Pobelter's YouTube where he uploads highlights of his most exciting games and moments! https://www.youtube.com/user/Pobelt
[6:34:13] smellofdog: which is just ridiculous, you get punished for making 3 plays on the map
[6:34:26] smellofdog: and the otehr guy is just PVE for 10 minute and then ahead of you 2 levels in xp? its crazy
[6:34:27] Cougar_Life: LETSGO THATS WHY HES THE GOAT
[6:34:27] the_tozo: wp to this jungler
[6:34:29] Highfivesghost: prediction
[6:34:30] Nightbot: https://discord.com/invite/SsnXFXxkVt hang with the hottest dudes and eat at the chillest restaurants in my stream community Discord
[6:34:32] Kelbotay: 5Head
[6:34:32] supertfsuperfan100: he is simply better
[6:34:33] flippyJAM: BIG
[6:34:35] EgyptianOverlord: that was an elite flash predict
[6:34:42] MultilateralDev: that prediction Pog
[6:34:46] sodepode: Is that Ville Valo? Cos it's HIM
[6:34:48] smellofdog: doing anything other than full clearing is just simply wrong as a jungler atm, which fucking sucks
[6:34:51] seb7stian: this reason he can do this is cause he has 200 iq folks dont try it at home
[6:35:07] goodnightx33: @smellofdog Noway if you don't do anything other than walking on the map you get behind in xp AINTNOWAY
[6:35:09] Cougar_Life: zeri moment
[6:35:15] zerodatman420: gank confidence is a powerful drug it could make the scaredest of laners all in 3 levels down just cuz they see thier jungler is comeing
[6:35:17] kispir_: good death
[6:35:23] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 what?
[6:35:28] Cougar_Life: what kind of toppings on that pizza pob lookingR
[6:35:31] Highfivesghost: where’s the pizza from?
[6:35:47] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 if one jungler is 1 camp ahead and the other jungler is 3 kills ahead, the xp is literally favored the one doing PVE
[6:35:56] Baazett: icecream so good
[6:36:16] honeymustard91: @smellofdog its the nature of the role imo, your enemy will just invade you on repeat until you either tilt invade and get punished because youre down tempo or tilt gank and get punished because youre down xp
[6:36:57] goodnightx33: @smellofdog yes but the enemy laners are now behind in xp and gold and jungler is so far ahead in gold half a level wont matter
[6:36:58] honeymustard91: thats the snowballing part of playing jungler that makes lee sin or nidalee or belveth so fun to me
[6:37:00] pobelterfan3: ive been cheating on ur stream with karasmai the kayn jungle main
[6:37:01] FlowAUT: !opgg
[6:37:01] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Pobelter-NA1
[6:37:01] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 idk man i just feel like the duality of jungle is full clear jungle vs tempo jungle, it always has been, but they want to nerf JUNGLE but all they did is nerf GANK junglers so now its sujper hard doing anything other than ful lclear
[6:37:08] pobelterfan3: oops! lol hahaha
[6:37:17] wheelsonthestrugglebus: I remember my first game of jungle my mid asked for blue buff lvl 1 and I said sure
[6:37:24] theArambulance: are they good?
[6:37:32] wheelsonthestrugglebus: And from then on out I thought that was the expectation
[6:37:32] Cougar_Life: grubs werent taken yet pob lookingR
[6:37:39] goodnightx33: @smellofdog Best thing riot did is nerfing jg
[6:37:45] Highfivesghost: likes the cookies but doesn’t want more sort of sus
[6:37:45] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 nah man  thats not the point. the point is one JUNGLER is ahead of the other, and the one ahead is the one palying WORSE. forget the team those are variables, you aalways focus on yourself in solo q
[6:37:58] SassPeach: Chatting
[6:38:02] adip0: Chatting
[6:38:05] theArambulance: he just had pizza i feel like cookies are kinda weird after pizza i wouldnt want more than one either
[6:38:10] scooterCx: modCheck
[6:38:10] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 for sure jgl can be nerfed, but theyre only nerfing one type of junglers
[6:38:20] syanne: the secret ingredient is rat poison
[6:38:23] goodnightx33: @smellofdog then go full clear and win the game in your logic
[6:38:28] theArambulance: D:
[6:38:33] Yokuz116: Well it's not a secret anymore
[6:38:35] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 well yeah exactly what im doing XD i just dont like it
[6:38:35] 7Locrian7: im gonna type -1 even though pob missed nothing -1
[6:38:44] Cougar_Life: EZ GRUBS
[6:38:44] theArambulance: actually he did miss 1 grub
[6:38:46] theArambulance: -1
[6:39:05] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 but that renders so many champs worse than others. tell me why would a shyvana bring more value to a team than lee sin? because she can just clear jgl faster? is that really good for the game
[6:39:07] Cougar_Life: he got to the grubs late he didnt miss it Madge
[6:39:08] MDAos: !grub
[6:39:12] goodnightx33: @smellofdog every other role likes it who cares about you xdd
[6:39:15] Highfivesghost: stocks in Japan hit a new hogh
[6:39:23] pingkylol: so did average age
[6:39:23] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 what? XD
[6:39:28] nathenn: Krispy Kreme donut dipped in milk must try if u have not
[6:39:30] pobelterfan3: play yasuo or yone
[6:39:44] honeymustard91: i genuinely dont think that you can quantify one jungler playing good/bad depending on playstyle, it still takes awareness and decision making to crossmap or match ganks, and if you do neither youre shitting the bed anyways
[6:39:47] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 jungle is the least popular role, hardest role, lowest winrate, sure if you dont play jungle you dont care  XD but that is biased as fk
[6:39:50] thebabahyuck: It was our mayo
[6:39:54] FearSide5: rylai liandry's is good because it keeps solid damage vs creeps
[6:39:59] pingkylol: lowest winrate XDDD
[6:40:04] FearSide5: a lot of ap items just favour damage vs champs
[6:40:07] pingkylol: hardest xddd
[6:40:08] goodnightx33: @smellofdog @smellofdog jg is hardest role go cope away pls
[6:40:12] theArambulance: isnt jungle winrate literally 50%
[6:40:20] Akynam_97: @goodnightx33 but it is
[6:40:21] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 i really dont understand you XD
[6:40:25] MrFruitzy: just won a run. three of a kind level 15
[6:40:29] Highfivesghost: looking
[6:40:31] adip0: @theArambulance KEKW
[6:40:37] goodnightx33: Fighting AI camps and reading lanes is so hard xdd
[6:40:37] Akynam_97: laners can just turtle under tower and farm safe if anything goes wrong
[6:40:38] goodnightx33: go cope
[6:40:38] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 what would you think is the hardest role? any player above diamond would agreee that jungle by far is the hardest role
[6:40:45] Akynam_97: jungle can get constantly attacked by enemy team
[6:40:52] nathenn: Dallas Stars are winning tomorrow.
[6:40:56] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 ??? that definition is literally the same in all lanes are miions and camps not the same?
[6:40:56] pobelterfan3: league is just for fun dey said chat
[6:40:57] dingplaysgames: @smellofdog hes just a troll and a bad one at that lol
[6:40:58] goodnightx33: @smellofdog no one says that
[6:40:59] pingkylol: why would any player agree to that
[6:41:08] pobelterfan3: league is just for fun. not to win. they said
[6:41:10] Cougar_Life: holy essaying can yall just kiss and watch the stream
[6:41:14] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 idk your takes are so obviously low elo that there is no point arguing with you
[6:41:15] pobelterfan3: BibleThump NotLikeThis HeyGuys Kappa LUL
[6:41:15] Cougar_Life: or go jack off or somethin jesus
[6:41:16] fizzymin: Chatting
[6:41:17] smellofdog: for sure they do
[6:41:18] pingkylol: idk if there's a real "hardest role" but probably if there were itd be top lane
[6:41:18] Urkoth: BriarFeet LETS BriarFeet GO BriarFeet POBELTER BriarFeet
[6:41:20] rammersvampen: just play safe top btw chatting
[6:41:24] goodnightx33: @smellofdog good laners fight you for every cs the only thing you are kiting is the blue
[6:41:25] Highfivesghost: where are the mods
[6:41:26] adip0: BriarFeet CAUGHT
[6:41:28] pingkylol: most hard punished
[6:41:28] smellofdog: any player above 1year of game time agrees jungle are hardest role
[6:41:35] pingkylol: what are usaying lmao
[6:41:38] Havoknuke: @pingkylol worst take ive ever seen
[6:41:41] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 mate im done talking to you you for sure are peak platinum 200 hours played
[6:41:43] Akynam_97: @goodnightx33 nah you are clueless
[6:41:44] Highfivesghost: top is the hardest role by far
[6:41:45] nathenn: hardest role is the one that has to buy items. It isn’t that hard to decipher guys.
[6:41:46] theArambulance: too bad briar is probably in top 5 most used emotes in pob stream
[6:41:52] theArambulance: PepeHands
[6:41:55] beltbuster: support is the hardest imo
[6:41:57] goodnightx33: @smellofdog @smellofdog go cope away pisslow
[6:42:00] 7Locrian7: lookingR BriarFeet
[6:42:00] rammersvampen: @smellofdog jungle is litterally the easiest role and it's not even close
[6:42:01] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 XD
[6:42:09] smellofdog: nah you guys cannot be serious
[6:42:14] sirfan11: mid is hardest role u hard stuck em players
[6:42:15] adip0: @theArambulance BriarFeet CAUGHT PepeHands
[6:42:20] Akynam_97: @goodnightx33 i don't think anyone agrees with you here stop being delusional
[6:42:21] smellofdog: since when did jungle become not the hardest role
[6:42:26] MultilateralDev: SNIFFA BriarFeet
[6:42:27] theArambulance: @adip0 repent
[6:42:28] FearSide5: i doing a low equip run in elden ring and my character ran through a poison swamp. after her feet were green with stink clouds coming off them
[6:42:29] Yokuz116: Hardest role, BY FAR, is support
[6:42:29] Urkoth: BriarFeet LETS BriarFeet GO BriarFeet POBELTER BriarFeet  󠀀
[6:42:31] FearSide5: hottest thing i ever seen
[6:42:33] unlessiamwrong: @smellofdog isn't plat for 200 hours pretty good?
[6:42:35] rammersvampen: jungle has never been the hardest role?
[6:42:38] Highfivesghost: i don’t play jungle but I can say it’s the easiest role
[6:42:43] smellofdog: @unlessiamwrong you got a point
[6:42:43] honeymustard91: @fearside5 ayooo
[6:42:51] nathenn: I like to play Cypher and do setup river when I get jungle
[6:42:51] Cougar_Life: weirdCorn
[6:42:54] MageWrecker: @Yokuz116 thats bait
[6:42:55] smellofdog: @Highfivesghost ive you dont play jungle you literally cant say anything XD
[6:42:56] 7Locrian7: the hardest role is the one i play, and the easiest one is the one that keeps ganking me Smadge
[6:43:00] Swaggarnaut_Beech: pobeast with the taliyah tech PogChamp
[6:43:00] scooterCx: WTF Pog
[6:43:02] snj10111: Pog
[6:43:03] fatnaldini: arugin in chat kinda Weirdge
[6:43:09] smellofdog: the only ones that think jungle is an easy role literally have never played jungle
[6:43:15] fatnaldini: arguing
[6:43:16] Purpledrakens: jgl need to gank 3 lane, clear its jgl, do objective, prevent invade, invade, all at the same time. yeah, definitly the easiest role zzz
[6:43:26] TLS_Fish1: support is the easiest, mid is second easiest
[6:43:27] pingkylol: that just means they have highest agency, not that they're hardest
[6:43:29] pingkylol: lol
[6:43:29] SassPeach: Chatting jungle this jungle that
[6:43:30] smellofdog: it might be an easy role in bronze . gold but that just is a stupid take cus in those elo all roles are op
[6:43:44] Urkoth: FirstTimeBackseating
[6:43:44] FearSide5: no one ever say pls don't die alistar
[6:43:45] theArambulance: that isn't agency lol
[6:43:46] FearSide5: makes you think
[6:43:49] Havoknuke: @TLS_Fish1 you are low elo for sure if you think mid is easy
[6:43:51] Yokuz116: Laning = last hit....last hit...trade a little.....last hite....last hit wow such skill
[6:44:09] smellofdog: bro jungle is for sure the most difficult role and its always been like that XD you get lower gold lower xp you have to watch entire map you have SMITE like how can any other role be harder?
[6:44:10] honeymustard91: top is hardest, jungle second hardest, thats pretty much it lol
[6:44:12] rammersvampen: the hardest part about jungle is not solo losing the game over grubs/scuttles
[6:44:13] Highfivesghost: mid is sort of easy and sort of hard. I would say it’s mid
[6:44:16] TLS_Fish1: @Havoknuke I mean, mid is my secondary and i find it piss easy
[6:44:26] Urkoth: urkothKAK
[6:44:29] Yokuz116: Oof
[6:44:35] Terrorizem: i mean not worth but like not the worst I guess
[6:44:42] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 top is hard in different ways. but top is also the most rewarding role, winning top means youre 2k gold ahead and 3 levels
[6:44:53] goodnightx33: Junglers = copers
[6:44:54] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 winning jungle you can still be equal xp and gold
[6:44:59] goodnightx33: easiest role in league
[6:45:01] smellofdog: i think support by far is the easiest role
[6:45:02] draiinprince: took a loan for amp tome
[6:45:13] Yokuz116: Also, when does your botlane feed and ever be like "fkn top diff?" Jng get shit for everything
[6:45:14] honeymustard91: seeing toplaners go 37 waves without getting 1 creep because enemy darius is permafreezing, i get secondhand cancer from it
[6:45:19] theArambulance: yeah even aphromoo admitted support is easy
[6:45:22] Havoknuke: @TLS_Fish1 i mid secondary as well as a jg player but i think its easier for me due to already being used to moving around map
[6:45:25] Akynam_97: @goodnightx33 can you stop barking, your takes are trash
[6:45:32] goodnightx33: @Akynam_97 jump
[6:45:39] TLS_Fish1: @Havoknuke What elo?
[6:45:44] Havoknuke: @TLS_Fish1 dia
[6:45:47] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 please link ur opgg so we can all point and laugh at you
[6:46:01] pingkylol: idk jg is kinda inflated
[6:46:09] TLS_Fish1: @Havoknuke Ok, im master. Theres no way mid is harder than ad or top
[6:46:10] pingkylol: top leaderboards on NA are all top lane and jg players
[6:46:12] blarggy: 0/10 powerspike inc
[6:46:14] KarmaEnjoyer: WOAH
[6:46:24] theArambulance: isnt that more to do with what champs are strong than the role
[6:46:27] smellofdog: @pingkylol nah mate its not
[6:46:27] Terrorizem: support is easier to play mediocre and get away with it, but a impactful support makes a lot of difference
[6:46:29] nathenn: infiltrating your games perhaps
[6:46:33] pingkylol: AD is pretty straightforward tbh i feel like it's easier than mid/top
[6:46:35] goodnightx33: @smellofdog Go laugh at your mother
[6:46:35] drstupiid: Can try win? Or just take lose
[6:46:37] smellofdog: @pingkylol its all toplaners. literally any server TOP is by far the easiest to climb
[6:46:41] pingkylol: it literally is, go look
[6:46:42] Swaggarnaut_Beech: the hardest role in league is drafting. we get it chat.
[6:46:43] smellofdog: @goodnightx33 XD
[6:46:50] adip0: lol mods where yall at
[6:46:51] Akynam_97: ye just block him, he is litearl 10 year old
[6:46:52] jordanmon18: Guys you pick a role and play it until it is ez if you think your role is hard it's probably because you need more practice
[6:46:53] Havoknuke: mid macro is hard tbh
[6:47:06] honeymustard91: @smellofdog i think that its important to keep in mind it goes both ways, there are games where your team plays for you as jg and youre put in a good position, or youre on the receiving end of the other team doing that
[6:47:28] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 you will win more games as a top player than a jujngle player, thats just a fact
[6:47:36] smellofdog: @honeymustard91 but for sure i get your point
[6:47:44] pingkylol: 8/25 top players on NA are junglers @smellofdog
[6:47:47] fatnaldini: pob chilling while chat is burning
[6:47:50] pingkylol: idk
[6:47:58] smellofdog: @pingkylol top 5 EU are all toplaners
[6:48:03] smellofdog: so like whats ur point
[6:48:04] TLS_Fish1: @smellofdog That is anything but a fact. Hahaha
[6:48:13] nathenn: @fatnaldini pob has unleashed the hammer before. it’s only a matter of time.
[6:48:13] Swaggarnaut_Beech: @smellofdog but every game has a winning team and a losing team with a top and a jungle. so i think the WR's are equal Kappa
[6:48:18] pingkylol: idk that means it has most carry potential then, not that it's hardest
[6:48:23] pingkylol: is support hardest because it has least carry potential?
[6:48:25] pingkylol: nop
[6:48:29] fatnaldini: im waiting for it this is cringe
[6:48:33] smellofdog: the winrates are not equal wtf guys this is super easy things to decypher XD
[6:48:36] nathenn: real
[6:48:37] smellofdog: do you not have math
[6:48:40] Highfivesghost: I’m only a silver support player but I can say that he’s play jungle all wrong Kappa
[6:48:46] Nightbot: subscribe to my TikTok BatChest tiktok.com/@pobelter
[6:48:48] pingkylol: this is pretty cringe talking about hardest roles
[6:48:48] Swaggarnaut_Beech: @pingkylol no shot. support can carry hard, just not with "damage" which is the low elo stat
[6:48:52] SchismDP: winrates are not equal lmaoo
[6:48:54] goodnightx33: EZ Cannon
[6:48:55] EphemeralLove: +1

[6:49:12] smellofdog: wtf XD
[6:49:17] Nightbot: Check out Pobelter's YouTube where he uploads highlights of his most exciting games and moments! https://www.youtube.com/user/Pobelt
[6:49:18] pingkylol: i mean, look leaderboards for all regions, sup mains are underrepresented
[6:49:19] honeymustard91: yeah and same for top, youll get games where youre on island and enemy top has his j4/khazix/lee in bush nonstop, or youll be the one with the backup, its just luck of the draw and nature of the game
[6:49:26] AzertyKeys: i'm ooming too Kreygasm
[6:49:34] EgyptianOverlord: you're already 1/4th mana
[6:49:36] smellofdog: everyone knows that jungle is hardest role, anything else is a soyboy take and i will not have it Keepo
[6:49:36] adip0: i remember when we just spammed BriarFeet and just chilled Sadge

[6:50:00] nathenn: my most embarrassing games are on Tali
[6:50:06] Kithlan: Did someone say feet? atpMouth BriarFeet
