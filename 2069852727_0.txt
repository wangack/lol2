[4:07:07] aggese: see? you distracted her, she never exppected that invade
[4:07:50] aggese: aatrox is very good against riven, they just don't expect it to be viper, thats why
[4:08:05] ouwarguii: goaty
[4:08:07] ouwarguii: goat
[4:08:17] xyz_abc: also aatrox is just rly strong atm

[4:10:10] MeloviI: @jaykills6785 not rly u gotta be a goat
[4:10:10] xyz_abc: i thought it was an even matchup
[4:10:11] JiudaLoL: aatrox been strong for like 50 season now
[4:10:15] Breakeyy: @aggese I mean if you're counterpicking there are so many better options than Aatrox
[4:10:27] xyz_abc: its just that aatrox is giga strong atm
[4:10:48] Breakeyy: @xyz_abc its literally a skill based matchup thats all it is
[4:10:48] aggese: @Breakeyy aatrox is very strong if played correctly vs riven
[4:10:58] aggese: that too xyz
[4:11:02] xyz_abc: @Breakeyy yea thats what i said
[4:11:35] Revangelkr: xd
[4:11:37] ouwarguii: viper sacrificed pyke lol
[4:11:49] Vericool21: nah brohe ran in himself
[4:11:56] Breakeyy: @aggese I dont disagree, but picking Aatrox whom you have to play insanely good against a possible viper on riven isnt necessarily a counter pick
[4:12:31] aggese: I never said it's a counter pick, a guy asked why is aatrox on every game
[4:12:37] Breakeyy: Its harder for Riven cuz you have to dodge Aatrox's Q otherwise you instalose, while Aatrox has to hit them
[4:12:48] Breakeyy: @aggese ye sorries
[4:12:48] Bryan16gg: Is this spotify or waht?
[4:12:51] aggese: the matchup is skill based but if you take it champ to champ aatrox is stronger right now I believe
[4:12:56] goodname223: Its an easy matchup for a good riven
[4:12:58] Breakeyy: @aggese agreed
[4:13:00] aggese: viper is just too good
[4:13:21] goodname223: But aatrox is stronger rn
[4:13:26] aggese: also aatrox's been around for a long time now too, the champ is good
[4:13:57] Versatio_: wow, it clearly is skill based
[4:14:01] svii: I think riven wins the matchup early game but aatrox outscales her later on
[4:14:03] Versatio_: that fight was sick
[4:14:05] BestHecarimOBlock: GoatEmotey
[4:14:07] Breakeyy: The champ is just broken so ppl pick it
[4:14:18] Breakeyy: @svii Yeah it comes down to team comps in the end

[8:05:31] imibby_: does core only do this in your games?
[8:05:38] imibby_: i swear he does it every time to you
[8:05:50] quincy_chan: probably target int u
[8:05:52] Viper: idk how
[8:05:53] Viper: he ints this often

[8:05:56] quincy_chan: xdd
[8:06:09] imibby_: @Viper it like the zyra game
[8:06:12] quincy_chan: what did u do to him?
[8:06:30] bob493: @Grint23 not out yet, but its just lifesteal on the damage. It makes it more in line with how ravenous used to be
[8:06:45] bob493: goredrinker was stridebreaker with % heals, not damage based heal
[8:07:50] seanblades7: this is so sad
[8:07:58] bob493: I mean no, conceptually its different. Like saying sundered sky is just lifesteal is ... kind of correct but conceptually different.
[8:08:03] bob493: goredrinker only worked on champions for instance
[8:08:09] bob493: new ravenous active will work on minions
[8:08:19] bob493: its fundamentally different, even though the animation may look similar

[8:11:03] seanblades7: you didnt vote
[8:11:49] quincy_chan: start surrender but didn’t vote Weirdge
[8:12:21] bob493: its functionally different yes, they compare in the fact they both provide sustain and  damage, but equivocating them is incorrect imo
[8:12:24] Chrisssan: why is core getting caught out of place so many times?
[8:12:27] bob493: its functionally similar*
[8:12:53] Chrisssan: shouldn't sesrver go down for patch?

[8:13:10] bob493: goredrinker  was way more damage and at low hp, way more sustain.  You didnt need to build AD to get benefit from it
[8:13:26] bob493: ravenous will scale on pure ad only; not hp; it functions very very differently

[8:13:35] Nightbot: ▶️ Giveon - "For Tonight" -> open.spotify.com/track/1TlTzdsEpgfsmbuNfYmWfG

[8:13:57] bob493: yea
[8:14:01] Arig4r: this fiddle.
[8:14:10] bob493: its just not fair to directlly compare them, as similar as though they appear
[8:14:15] quincy_chan: Pog kenny penta
[8:14:22] bob493: pedantic but it is what it is
[8:14:31] BestWienerdogNA: malp just dog into their comp?
[8:14:40] Chrisssan: at this point, shouldn't core's job be locking out Kennen only?

[8:16:29] bob493: @Grint23 no its fair to think about these things
[8:16:31] Chrisssan: WOWWW thats an actual int and grief
[8:16:44] bob493: understanding the game and sometimes importantly, what your opponent will be getting is helpful
[8:16:58] bob493: like if you know riven is gonna slam out a huge heal on her ravenous
[8:17:03] bob493: might keep you from inting into it
[8:17:19] bob493: because theres no shot riven doesnt get ravenous next patch lol
[8:17:27] bob493: beautiful item on her
[8:18:06] bob493: cant wait to play out some fiora with new ravenous
[8:18:12] luxmyboo: Malp inting eh
[8:18:28] bob493: look at his items haha
[8:18:38] Chrisssan: not only malph gooing ap now, he is actively griefing the game
[8:18:42] Chrisssan: is he a wintrader?
[8:18:54] bob493: @Grint23 i main shyvana; usually I get titanic, but the new changes are mighty interseting
[8:19:05] bob493: her Q applies ravenous stacks twice
[8:19:09] zhekhe: GGS
[8:19:15] Kylon1235: GGS
[8:19:16] luxmyboo: Gg
[8:19:18] zhekhe: YES
[8:19:19] bob493: so it could be a great item with the enhanced sustain
[8:19:30] bob493: who knew, full ap malphite in a challenger game is troll
[8:19:49] bob493: still mad at phreak for the recent shyv buffs; so pointless
[8:19:56] Viper: oh we can still queue up
[8:19:58] Viper: i thought ranked down
[8:20:03] leying_: i refuse to believe malp is challenger
[8:20:24] bob493: it upsets me because it shows a conceptual misunderstanding of whats wrong with the game
[8:20:30] bob493: literally no one on the planet
[8:20:32] interbot44: which radio is this?
[8:20:50] bob493: "upset" is a stronger word than Id use, but i cant think of something slightly milder lol
[8:20:52] bob493: but like
[8:21:03] bob493: no one on the planet is going "man I wish ap shyvana did more damage"

[8:23:54] bob493: xD
[8:24:43] bob493: shyvs weakness is point and click
[8:24:50] bob493: which theres admittedly a lot of in the game
[8:24:56] bob493: but you can also itemize out of a lot of it
[8:25:12] Massi_: he is mixing up when he E's and holds his w very long
[8:26:02] bob493: @Viper  have you heard don diablos new song? I think youd really like it
[8:26:06] eatingbeefenjoyer: which type of mexican meat is best in tacos
[8:26:13] bob493: its called "physique" its really g ood
[8:26:58] bob493: @Grint23 thats the beauty of it. So bear with me for a moment
[8:27:03] bob493: her E "marks" for 5 seconds
[8:27:08] bob493: her E mark damage scales with AD
[8:27:16] bob493: so at 300 ad it does like 8% max hp magic
[8:27:22] Massi_: agurin kinda disagrees with baus here :D
[8:27:22] bob493: then you have bork which is 12% current hp
[8:27:31] bob493: then titanic
[8:27:36] bob493: which has on hit
[8:27:38] bob493: then you get rageblade
[8:27:46] Massi_: bob through liandries in there why not :D
[8:27:53] bob493: so then you E - AA - Q - AA - titanic - AA
[8:27:54] Massi_: *throw
[8:27:55] bob493: thats 8 procs
[8:28:14] bob493: thats 12% current x 8; thats 8% max hp x8. but its both magic AND physical; it slaps harder than you can imagine
[8:28:34] Massi_: hope viper learned
[8:28:35] bob493: very very very hard to itemize against, and tabis do not reduce on hit
[8:28:37] Massi_: from baussen macrto
[8:28:41] vrgambit: I was learning from that
[8:28:46] lamp_____________________: thebaus has some crazy macro
[8:28:47] Viper: same malphite
[8:28:47] Viper: lol
[8:28:55] Viper: and same
[8:28:56] bob493: plus on hit damage gives you lfie steal; so getting shit like bloodthirster makes you drain tank like crazy
[8:28:57] Viper: scripter
[8:28:59] Viper: i have on myt team ewveryugame
[8:29:00] Viper: WTF
[8:29:05] bob493: boo
[8:29:07] vrgambit: The zeri with Korean name?
[8:29:10] lamp_____________________: but viper diff??
[8:29:12] sexinuggets99: 15 angle
[8:29:14] Massi_: @lamp_____________________ im convinced he just ran it, saw it somehow work out and then backtracked the analysis :D
[8:29:19] vrgambit: I had Korean scripter zeri earlier in master game
[8:29:31] vrgambit: Most played was janna lulu nami on profile..
[8:29:42] Massi_: lulu nutty scripter champ
[8:29:54] bob493: @Grint23 also, all of shyvanas abilities are reset or modified by autos, so running lethal tempo makes this combo really nuts
[8:29:55] abzorbcass: not the scripter again noooooooo
[8:30:02] Chrisssan: i can't believe that ashe support is not a troll
[8:30:07] vrgambit: Yes its very nutty to have highest mastery as 3 supports then magic zeri God
[8:30:07] sexinuggets99: gonna have to 1v9
[8:30:08] kobex7: no mic?
[8:30:09] Chrisssan: its actually OP
[8:30:30] bob493: @Grint23 heres the spicy part, her E damage still has 70% (instead of 120%) full ad scaling AND level scaling, so it still does 1000 damage per e lol
[8:30:30] Massi_: @Chrisssan if she had only R mid lategame on short CD she would already be viable without qwe

[8:32:11] bob493: @Massi_ 3 items is fair
[8:32:22] bob493: @Grint23 cdr
[8:32:24] bob493: thats it
[8:32:41] Massi_: if you win teamfights but to snowball you need to pop of 1 item pretty much
[8:32:46] Massi_: which i guess bork does well enough

[8:33:26] bob493: @enri_enri_enri nice song
[8:33:34] bob493: @Massi_ YES, exact same concept!
[8:33:36] Massi_: its almost like old sonderer
[8:33:40] Massi_: *sunderer
[8:33:40] bob493: and same voice actess
[8:33:44] Massi_: LOL
[8:33:52] Massi_: i have voices turned off fk that
[8:33:54] bob493: i love goofing with elise top, I cant get it to work tho
[8:34:01] bob493: like conceptually, its identical though
[8:34:04] enri_enri_enri: @bob493 a man of culture GoatEmotey
[8:34:10] bob493: could probably do the same build honestly
[8:34:11] Massi_: bob493 you run ghost flash and just use ghost for a winning trade lvl1
[8:34:14] bob493: no
[8:34:16] bob493: lol
[8:34:19] bob493: exhaust...
[8:34:24] Massi_: you can also proxy lvl1 to pull the wave etc
[8:34:26] bob493: because im a cunt and no one is allowed to have fun
[8:34:27] Massi_: exhast is the same
[8:34:28] bob493: lol
[8:34:30] bob493: no
[8:34:32] bob493: its not ahhaa
[8:34:34] Massi_: but you can split better with ghost
[8:34:45] bob493: imagine that poor renekton with no move speed and no damage xD
[8:34:49] Massi_: i mean exh works the same in creating that 1 winning trade
[8:34:55] bob493: also shyvana has too much inherent movespeed for ghost to work out
[8:35:01] bob493: she gets 50% from her W
[8:35:03] Massi_: sure im talking elise
[8:35:06] bob493: OH
[8:35:08] bob493: yeah for sure
[8:35:12] bob493: you can space better on elise
[8:35:15] bob493: yeah same idea
[8:35:17] bob493: movespeed
[8:35:17] Massi_: but exh would work on her too in lane
[8:35:17] SHISUI96_plus: udre supposed toreset there to come right in timewhere u crash into dive
[8:35:25] Massi_: i just go ghost for splitpush
[8:35:27] aimsss7: !rank
[8:35:28] LoLRankBot: Effortless is Challenger  1259 LP
[8:35:35] Massi_: which is probably restarted anyway :D
[8:35:38] bob493: ghost on elise makes sense, she doesnt have the MS steroid shyv has
[8:35:39] interbot44: nasus is so done for holy shit
[8:36:02] Massi_: bob493 have you faces the tank nida top yet :D
[8:36:11] bob493: there is no "tank" vs shyvana
[8:36:12] bob493: lol
[8:36:17] bob493: but no
[8:36:26] bob493: elise should be the same
[8:36:29] Massi_: you speak like shyv has no early game :D
[8:36:36] bob493: @Massi_ no shes super strong haha
[8:36:45] SHISUI96_plus: udyre gank timingsare dog
[8:36:50] bob493: very few champions outduel her level 1, which is surprising
[8:36:50] ReformedChampionHorizon: Wp
[8:37:00] bob493: couple champs you gotta wait, like darius and sett
[8:37:01] ahmed_e262: when do you go bruiser over lethality
[8:37:17] bob493: whats yuour elise build?
[8:37:22] Massi_: bro
[8:37:25] Massi_: if only i knew
[8:37:28] bob493: I was trying bork nashors rageblade but it was too squishy
[8:37:29] Massi_: all items seem euqally strong
[8:37:33] ReformedChampionHorizon: @bob493 quite a few top lane champs can outduel her lvl 1 tbh
[8:37:35] Massi_: but rylais is a good failsafe
[8:37:42] ReformedChampionHorizon: @grint23 same
[8:37:46] Massi_: vs AP you can just go rookern first
[8:37:52] bob493: @ReformedChampionHorizon not really, though as mentioned , I do run exhaust
[8:38:05] bob493: it changes the dynamic of a lot of matchups
[8:38:08] Massi_: if im ahead i just rush Dcap bc its hard to finish in  a bind
[8:38:19] lamp_____________________: what the dog doin Kappa
[8:38:29] bob493: like irelia riven renekton, etc those types cant fight with exhaust; its really powerful
[8:38:32] Chrisssan: V1per showing hwo to play as riven vs. nasus. he doesn't have stacks dayum
[8:38:37] Massi_: exh amplifies stat checking so
[8:38:47] bob493: @Massi_ its very on purpose
[8:39:02] ReformedChampionHorizon: @bob493 what does exhaust do? You still lose a few witj exhaust, and eben if you have exhaust I dont need to commit to a fight. For example as Urgot, when wave arrives I just short trade with Pta and flip you and back off.
[8:39:19] bob493: @ReformedChampionHorizon you run pta into urgot, darius, morde and sett
[8:39:27] bob493: so you short trade with them and use your movespeed advantage
[8:39:33] Massi_: obv not getting your exhaust fizzled is part of playing the matchup
[8:39:39] ReformedChampionHorizon: You wont win the short trade in meele vs urgot tho
[8:39:46] bob493: you dont have to trade with urgot
[8:39:48] bob493: just e
[8:39:49] SHISUI96_plus: nice
[8:39:52] bob493: poke him down
[8:40:01] ReformedChampionHorizon: Hmmm, yeah that is fair
[8:40:04] bob493: urgot, darius, morde and sett are in this special group
[8:40:08] Massi_: also urgot is urgot
[8:40:16] bob493: you poke them until youre ready to kill them
[8:40:18] karlrmbo: !rank
[8:40:19] LoLRankBot: Effortless is Challenger  1259 LP
[8:40:19] ReformedChampionHorizon: I usually buy cull on urgot in those MUs for sustain with W
[8:40:21] Massi_: one champ has to be the apex
[8:40:22] bob493: then exhaust and you have a lot of mobility into them
[8:40:26] SHISUI96_plus: nasus tring to match u , and it worked
[8:40:53] Massi_: snacking plates
[8:41:04] bob493: @ReformedChampionHorizon its a feel thing; if urgot and morde are good I will usually just deviate into full ap build because they have a hard time just being hit constantly

[8:41:27] bob493: if I get an early lead, I get my bork rush as usual and its pretty damning
[8:41:32] bob493: bork is a gross item
[8:41:38] bob493: speaking of gross
[8:41:44] bob493: this jhin :o

[8:45:45] lamp_____________________: punish the dog
[8:46:13] Massi_: riven would still work if she literally couldnt auto but her passive dmg would proc on q3 or someting :D
[8:46:19] bob493: @theblindmonkkk move speed, attack speed, ad, ult cdr, health, then bonus attack speed and movement speed on your additional 30 cdr ult...
[8:46:22] Massi_: in fact shed be stronger
[8:46:25] bob493: sounds *pretty* good on riven my guy
[8:46:27] bob493: lol
[8:46:31] quincy_chan: vlad op champ
[8:46:51] Massi_: ye but bob you have to consider the use case, are you rlly gonna stop qwe just to utilize max atkspeed?
[8:47:00] Kylon1235: @bob493 attack speed is useless and u alr have low R cd
[8:47:17] theblindmonkkk: riven does not need attack speed steroid she weaves autos  between spells
[8:47:46] theblindmonkkk: they made the knock up aoe
[8:47:49] bob493: k lets try the other angle lol
[8:47:57] bob493: its incredibly gold efficient, gives AD, movespeed and hp
[8:48:00] bob493: lol
[8:48:09] quincy_chan: why tf red card?
[8:48:16] KnnTM: i miss the music :/
[8:48:18] lamp_____________________: cause timeout
[8:48:27] Massi_: Grint23 youre not wrong but rek has to build more glass cannon and malph can have more burst and obv a bit more range
[8:48:28] Blazianator: !music
[8:48:33] imibby_: this mf writing an essay every minute
[8:48:42] Massi_: use Malph R has the psychological effect of making your team follow :D
[8:48:47] theblindmonkkk: build path is terrible you could probably build  it when fed  with black cleaver or smth
[8:49:23] Massi_: Grint23 ye but its not enough you could say nami is better malphite :D
[8:49:42] Massi_: guess the size of aoe is also a factor :D
[8:50:00] winnzonly: hey, good morning all I wanted to say is you have a beatiful voice that is pleasant to the ears imo
[8:50:19] quincy_chan: hey, good morning all I wanted to say is you have a beatiful voice that is pleasant to the ears imo
[8:51:19] Massi_: ye if malph builds tank you have a problem if reksai builds tank you ignore it
[8:51:34] bob493: haha
[8:51:39] Massi_: idk about that both pretty fast
[8:51:55] Massi_: guess tunnels are telegraphing alot

[8:54:24] SHISUI96_plus: not fed case , he just playing right
[8:54:28] Massi_: it all started with the nasus not starting e
[8:54:36] Icflr: fill gap
[8:54:41] Chrisssan: this was not an easy game by any definitnion. that mid game was fking brutal for v1per
[8:54:59] Chrisssan: teams getting caught out of nowhere then overextending
[8:55:25] Massi_: but imagine being vipers brother and wasting your life getting a neuroscience degree instead of getting rank 1
[8:55:53] KKrazy81: does anyone know how viper chooses to build items? like when he decides to build dirk, or when he decides whether or not to get eclipse?
[8:56:08] bob493: thats a huge question lol
[8:56:09] quincy_chan: all his brothers are going pro no?
[8:56:26] Massi_: quincy_chan he has 3 and the oldest went responsible path :D
[8:56:36] Massi_: as older brothers do
[8:56:40] SHISUI96_plus: jinxed it
[8:56:40] Chrisssan: @KKrazy81 im not good, but my guess is that they have nasus and cc heavy team. so he needed to survive. when he builds dirk, he's against a squishy match up
[8:56:47] bob493: oh i thought viper was the oldest
