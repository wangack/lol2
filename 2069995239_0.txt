[1:58:24] TitusGroen: LOL
[1:58:41] wilsonao: KEKW saaaaame
[1:58:45] hamm_bone: i mean he has like 12 abilities so its understandable
[1:58:56] Gromzzz: hes a new ap carry
[1:59:07] hamm_bone: champ has 5 ults
[1:59:18] LordAudacity: i mean just go into practice mode lol
[1:59:23] avatre218: also really hard to see his abilities with everything else on the ground
[1:59:42] avatre218: usually can see them a bit better bc the champ has to be close...he was all the way up the river
[2:00:23] wilsonao: learning what aphelios does is a waste of time since aphelios players don't know either
[2:00:57] JdubCT: Nocturne really feels like old design
[2:00:57] angrypanties: lol wils
[2:01:18] LordAudacity: u dont think theres an advantage of knowing a enemy champ better that they do? @wilsonao
[2:01:44] angrypanties: he was joking ^
[2:01:48] DarkRedux: ff inc?
[2:01:49] LordAudacity: ah
[2:02:11] JdubCT: o7 in chat for poor Nocturne.
[2:02:12] wilsonao: @LordAudacity Not really when nobody in the game understands macro anyway
[2:02:18] JdubCT: Truly a brave sacrifice.
[2:02:28] angrypanties: oh I thought he was joking lol
[2:02:32] hamm_bone: thats why in my opinion shes better support
[2:03:21] wilsonao: I was joking tbh
[2:03:26] wilsonao: but its still true
[2:03:49] LeiteroMasta: classic smolder
[2:04:05] AnthonySo1337: I see why they called it smolder PepeLaugh
[2:04:06] JdubCT: I've not been super impressed by Smolder.
[2:04:15] JdubCT: The champion not this guy.
[2:04:24] hamm_bone: almost no one builds smolder correctly
[2:04:36] angrypanties: damn you deleted painter man
[2:05:00] hamm_bone: also hes better mid lane than bot imo
[2:05:21] hamm_bone: even though theres two people to technically stack off of bot
[2:06:06] DarkRedux: thats a hard smite with his combo
[2:06:12] SouthpawHardin: smiteLaugh
[2:06:19] JdubCT: Doesn't help that Smolder is doing negative damage. I developed age related health issues waiting for it to die.
[2:06:40] LordAudacity: smiteLaugh
[2:07:09] DarkRedux: smolder burn online
[2:07:48] hamm_bone: this seems like a decent game for smolder to buy liandries actually
[2:08:04] hamm_bone: but probably not necessary
[2:10:34] wilsonao: yoshiJAM
[2:10:52] angrypanties: 🐒
[2:11:52] angrypanties: is that donkey kong music
[2:12:16] hamm_bone: banjo kazooie

[2:17:52] wilsonao: to upgrade the hearths you add decorations
[2:18:04] wilsonao: it will say which decorations you need when you click on the hearth
[2:18:12] wilsonao: yeah those are
[2:18:15] wilsonao: but you need specific types
[2:18:20] robotSabotage: need a specific kind
[2:18:29] robotSabotage: green for first tier yea
[2:18:30] LordAudacity: u need comfort
[2:18:35] wilsonao: See where it  says comfort, harmony, aestetics on them?
[2:18:47] robotSabotage: the decorations with the green borders ye
[2:18:56] wilsonao: I usually build gardens and parks
[2:18:59] robotSabotage: "Comfort"
[2:21:39] wilsonao: can just delete the building to get resources back
[2:22:37] Eldiloft: I love this game
[2:22:58] DarkRedux: Mario Cart baby
[2:24:13] Eldiloft: You might want to put a lizard on the hearth Saint
[2:25:27] Eldiloft: It gives you an extra buff that the human you have doesn't. +1 global resolve. When you see that little red symbol on the card when assigning, that means that unit gets a specialization bonus
[2:26:21] DarkRedux: Playin the songs of my childhood
[2:27:10] Wazepas: !gamble all

[2:40:43] lebrongabes: I thought they got rid of dominion
[2:40:43] mdiesel394: this xayah is insane lmao
[2:40:48] VashTheQuickDraw: More kills than minutes in game
[2:41:06] wilsonao: 50 deaths at 17 minutes: legit

[2:52:34] nickshn: also feels weird not seeing you play jg anymore
[2:53:19] Kaviji: this just the inqueue game?
[2:53:55] Kaviji: I was seein the map overlay and it tripped me out for a moment LUL
[2:53:59] Eldiloft: You need to have a building capable of producing them
[2:54:16] Kaviji: "wtf did they do to summoners rift?"
[2:54:25] Little_Toaster7: did you ever play black and white with the little god characters?
[2:55:06] makleboi: It's worse than a dangerous one
[2:55:12] makleboi: It is scary
[2:55:18] Kaviji: its got the baddies in it
[2:55:19] Eldiloft: Well then you can't make them yet. You can buy them from traders, get them from events, find a building on the map that's damaged that can, or on your resolve bar every little blue dot gives you a building choice
[2:56:45] Eldiloft: If you turn in your order you will get enough resolve to get to one of the dots and then get another building choice. Hopefully it's coats lol
[2:56:55] Shrapnel__: what this other SV is playing?
[2:57:06] Shrapnel__: other game
