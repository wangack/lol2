[2:08:25] xDinoBot: xDinoBot subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! 57 Years i've been asking sam for a TahmEg Game but he refuses to give me another Kench game. We need to unbench the kench as this is unbelievable that sam has rebenched the kench after unbenching him after so long. We must support the frog. Unibhibit the ribbit TahmEg this is unacceptable that TahmEg  is not the main champion right now. All we get is sleeper poppy gameplay ResidentSleeper which puts chat to bed instead of getting them hype with ghost ignite kench to chase down the enemies Madge
