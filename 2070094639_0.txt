[0:10:18] fistigons25: in all honesty, I’d prefer T1 vs NS over HLE vs KT. the T1 match was a banger, KT vs HLE was a mess

[0:15:02] ajollymate: can't see KT bans, your live image blocking
[0:15:16] e6merald6: @butelka_z_odzysku monte watches these to breakdown the game not to see who won lol
[0:15:32] vlagori: When is the next Powerspike episode?
[0:15:40] isaenzf: waddup lads
[0:15:46] Fissiccisst: remember when you coined the phrase squeezing the dragon when Dragon Trainer Trist came out? @MonteCristo Smolder reminds me of that every time I see em

[0:16:30] SirKavouris: hello everyone does anyone know why neeko is disabled in 14.3?

[0:19:52] e6merald6: should smolder be parma banned this season?
[0:20:11] najafan: @e6merald6 No, he should be gouda.
[0:20:14] spaceprincesssss: ali smoulder is not a lane 😢
[0:20:18] e6merald6: he kinda becoming the zeri when she came out
[0:20:34] kraethan: Looks likd thers a bug with neeko clone

[0:22:22] e6merald6: taliyah E can't damage yone on the back in his E?

[0:22:51] Phaetox: I use wasd for camera. Came from fps background so was much easier
[0:23:10] najafan: If you have a hypercarry, why don't you pick a disengage support that also has a stun for some extra utility?
[0:23:13] najafan: Just a thought.
[0:23:29] dredge4six: ? why wouldnt you be able to say lol
[0:23:45] najafan: @dredge4six If it's easily abusable.
[0:23:47] lazink: exploitable in the game

[0:25:04] dredge4six: kt v t1
[0:25:07] najafan: @ajollymate SKT vs KT
[0:25:11] ajollymate: ah ty
[0:25:13] ASquishyLiquid: monte can we exploit u?
[0:25:15] DigestivePrism2: if the neeko bug is the w one its been fixed in 14.4 anyway at least its in patch notes
[0:25:17] vikingrskald: @ajollymate KT vs T1 both are sponsored by telecommunications companies
[0:25:23] last_of_scions: thoughts on t1 vs ns match ?
[0:25:30] rfarleydude97: LMAO
[0:25:34] ajollymate: OH! makes sense, thanks! @vikingrskald
[0:25:37] e6merald6: @ajollymate T1 and KT they're owned a telecom company that's why when they fight it's called telecom war
[0:25:57] ASquishyLiquid: i promise in the off season ill use my prime on u instead of meteos
[0:25:57] e6merald6: by a*
[0:26:19] Shobes572: Shobes572 gifted a Tier 1 sub to ASquishyLiquid! They have given 75 Gift Subs in the channel!

[0:26:58] e6merald6: smolder is the new zeri
[0:27:03] PapaSmithy: would you say that your subscribers are getting the full monte?
[0:27:12] ASquishyLiquid: shobes let me prime ship u a beer
[0:27:19] Fissiccisst: I kinda love that smolder walks around like a dog, I expected him to fly everywhere
[0:27:19] XTI_Hero: Lol
[0:27:23] ASquishyLiquid: just need ur address
[0:27:25] ASquishyLiquid: and SIN number
[0:27:30] TangentCrab: This game is 2 fraud artists fighting in court
[0:27:48] getdeepfried: how do you feel about t1 almost dropping the ball against NS they kinda seem to be losing most early games now
[0:27:51] Shobes572: Lol, well I gave up drinking to be a workaholic
[0:28:14] Phaetox: Like korean Lissandra
[0:28:16] brissings: His uncanny face is up there too
[0:28:22] najafan: Counterpoint: Briar splash art
[0:28:23] lazink: knowing Riot, they used AI to make the voice, so they didn't have to pay the VA
[0:28:29] ASquishyLiquid: congrats bro
[0:28:32] FuHua_HoS: super galaxy rumble is the worst
[0:28:38] Shobes572: @papasmithy we don't get full monte until he's malding over KT fraud
[0:28:39] hey_malaise: faker is just godmode
[0:28:41] ASquishyLiquid: if only i can give up league
[0:28:46] GezelVT: @FuHua_HoS I so agree with this
[0:29:03] dredge4six: the noodle boys
[0:29:03] ASquishyLiquid: if i spent my time on league learning languages i could prob speak 5 by now
[0:29:11] Kodord: Game 2 was a banger tho at least
[0:29:16] e6merald6: they said playtime is over after game 2 loss LUL
[0:29:22] Phaetox: Bold assumption for you to think blg wouldn't drop a game to NS
[0:29:24] brissings: T1 fans are more annoying than old tsm fans at this point
[0:29:26] fistigons25: they were losing game 3 until Faker went super saiyan on Hwei
[0:29:26] Dreath1: faker had to carry some deadweights that series
[0:29:28] arielleej: I wonder how much of that T1 game 2 was mind gaming everyone else
[0:29:28] Phaetox: LUL
[0:29:48] butelka_z_odzysku: maybe from next ep just put t1 into special category called world champs and they gona be quiet?
[0:29:48] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:29:48] Fissiccisst: T1 has the best mind control
[0:30:18] Shobes572: I didn't watch the vods because I was semi hoping to see Montes POV on the T1 series
[0:30:20] kraethan: I think t1 might have been taking it a little too easy, lots of really lazy stuff in that series
[0:30:26] getdeepfried: the new hero picks are exciting lol
[0:30:27] S1lentSymphony: I think with more time, NS will end up being a really strong team. When they show up, they really show flashes of brilliance
[0:30:43] Dreath1: I know T1 winning one teamfight into instant nexus explosion is a meme but their early games have been concerning
[0:31:18] parkyr413: how much knowledge are you coming into these reviews with Monte? I know you know the winner. Are you checking drafts/stat lines or just, “who won?”
[0:31:24] Fissiccisst: does smolder have one of those annoying whiney child voices like they have on some of those childrens TV shows? That make parents physically recoil
[0:31:25] brissings: Why do people always have to make excuses for t1 maybe they just played bad
[0:31:26] Rumblextristana: Oh shit this is the long ass game
[0:31:37] fistigons25: @dreath1 Caedrel also said this. T1 has to clean up their early game a little. it’s getting too messy sometimes
[0:31:38] Pinkhas: I know this is off topic, but is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court worth it?
[0:31:45] swagbot12: why comet on aatrox
[0:31:56] kingkevin619: no t1 vs ns ?
[0:32:04] najafan: Smolder is the caillou of league of legends
[0:32:10] e6merald6: @Dreath1 we'll see when they play against stronger teams. Cause I only really see them losing early games on weaker teams so I dunno if it's just them fucking around or they're actually losing early
[0:32:39] ASquishyLiquid: in that case y dont u just not spoil urself the winner too if u know its a game ur gonna watch anyways
[0:32:42] trespasur: monte does Sentienls have more money than c9?
[0:32:47] parkyr413: @dreath1 I agree there is concerns, but also it’s clear they are playing off the cuff picks and seem to be limit testing some etc. I feel like when it comes down to brass tacks, it will be Gen G. and T1 at the end.
[0:33:22] Dreath1: @e6merald6 their botlane has just been omega cocky which is probably just egoing bad teams, but oner's pathing recently is a legitimate concern imo
[0:33:34] getdeepfried: if Zeka plays melee hero’s he’s a s-tier midlander but the instance he plays control he becomes extremely mid lol.
[0:34:05] e6merald6: @Dreath1 to be fair Oner has always been inconsisten in regular seasons so I'm not surprised
[0:34:27] Dreath1: man I fucking hate smolder w in lane it is so cancer
[0:34:32] brissings: The journey is more important
[0:34:34] rilsolo: you dont get context which is big
[0:34:45] najafan: Snape kills Dumbledore
[0:34:47] ASquishyLiquid: i actually never noticed that pre vision plant visual
[0:34:52] Kaniskion: let's put it to the test. spil away chat
[0:34:52] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:34:52] trespasur: sentinels content seems better quality, website built better
[0:34:56] najafan: Rosebud is a sled.
[0:34:58] xoceozcar: yo @montecristo,did you think more about the best game played by 5 question on si?
[0:35:06] AuzzyExxodius: Soylent green is people
[0:35:10] direpants2: i have a small penis
[0:35:16] e6merald6: that's just a go signal for us to spoil every fictional story made in existence
[0:35:17] rfarleydude97: Peter Parker was born at the end of Madame Web
[0:35:21] trespasur: mmm ty monte
[0:35:24] Pinkhas: THE MALTESE FALCON.
[0:35:25] parkyr413: @montecristo did you vod review the Pyosik Rammus game?
[0:35:28] najafan: @rfarleydude97 lmaowut
[0:35:32] DixMX: doesn't matter if DRX shits the bed 99% of the year, it only matters that they won the final stretch Kappa
[0:35:39] ASquishyLiquid: for me i dont care too much about spoilers just cause i almost never watch a whole vod of replays i just watch the highlights and then it doesnt really matter
[0:35:45] honeymstrd: Monte, I am your father
[0:35:48] trespasur: sentinels vct classic skin trailer was soooo good
[0:36:03] RawssDeBawss: I always thought Alliance vs Najin White Shield 2014 worlds was a decent played game, by Alliance at least XD
[0:36:04] ASquishyLiquid: or nowadays ill wait a few days to see if bangers only will show it
[0:36:04] e6merald6: @rfarleydude97 I heard they went out of their way to not mention anything peter parker related tho
[0:36:15] cryowizzzard: seems like the meta around the word is the same
[0:36:21] parkyr413: Say what you want about Pyosik, but he has a competitive win on Rammus in year of our lord 2024 and no one can take that from him.
[0:36:39] Dreath1: man I didn't watch this series, how the hell did KT lose with smolder in this position
[0:36:40] getdeepfried: you guys were talking about what would happen if faker was playing for KT instead of T1 at the start of his career doesn’t KT just become T1?
[0:36:50] brissings: I always enjoyed Lemondogs vs Omg in 2013
[0:37:01] najafan: They should show stacks in overlay for Smolder, Nasus, Senna, Veigar, Sion, etc
[0:37:04] Shimmerz: would you rather have glow up zeka on your team or no bad streaks pyosik
[0:37:04] parkyr413: @dreath1 that smolder builds a frozen heart
[0:37:18] RawssDeBawss: I basically only mentioned the Alliance one cause it was a "Perfect" game xD
[0:37:26] Dreath1: @parkyr413 wat
[0:37:27] getdeepfried: yea smolder doesn’t seem that strong
[0:37:30] Kaniskion: how'd he know? Susge
[0:37:34] rfarleydude97: @e6merald6 Thats some bullshit if thats the case lmao
[0:37:34] e6merald6: @getdeepfried skt and kt certainly doesn't have that much difference in names
[0:37:49] Dreath1: isn't this a 50 minute game just put bodies in front of him and let him execute the entire enemy team
[0:38:00] ASquishyLiquid: @cryowizzzard i miss the early days of league where most players had pocket pics
[0:38:13] rfarleydude97: unless the movie i read up about it from those that have seen it were lying + the official summary
[0:38:24] e6merald6: @rfarleydude97 sony doing sony things
[0:38:30] FuHua_HoS: @MonteCristo don't forget to check damage graph at end of this game
[0:38:33] getdeepfried: is it weird that I want to see faker on a different team lol
[0:38:33] Nidsmies: Damn, this is the first time I am amble to join in live to watch the series with you! Cheers!
[0:38:41] rfarleydude97: but with the way it is, its pretty much implied its Peter
[0:38:45] rfarleydude97: bc who else could it be??
[0:38:46] ASquishyLiquid: @Dreath1 SPOILER v-v
[0:39:06] ASquishyLiquid: @getdeepfried i want to see him in china
[0:39:15] ASquishyLiquid: couldnt he make more money in china?

[0:41:01] brissings: Paragon visually looked amazing back then
[0:41:06] kraethan: I had not seen that yet lol
[0:41:08] last_of_scions: can we get a razorcake for kt ?
[0:41:14] Fissiccisst: if its a baby, probably zerolingual
[0:41:20] Phaetox: cristoCAKE
[0:41:25] Krethas: will we see susie coming back to the scene (GMing etc.) or is she focusing on family?
[0:41:35] getdeepfried: who is the poy so far in lck
[0:41:41] Nidsmies: I laughed my ass off when you talked about the tweets from LCS games. It felt like the AI tweets from citybuilder games.
[0:41:41] cannata_: cannata_ subscribed with Prime. 
[0:41:50] Shimmerz: is there a gravitas image that’s just DOA yelling “what was that”
[0:41:54] ASquishyLiquid: becoming so is his english or korean better?
[0:42:00] 塵世中的一個迷途小書僮: Do you change your diet when you move to Korea?
[0:42:11] dbird901: but will Susie make an appearance on the SI 10 year special?
[0:42:13] Fissiccisst: So does baron randomly choose how he modifies his pit or does the dragon affect the change?
[0:42:49] Zbyggy: @Fissiccisst It's random 1 in 3 chance
[0:42:53] xoceozcar: ahh. that looks way too tasty
[0:43:01] lugubrieuzz: can u get tomatillos in korea
[0:43:03] Fissiccisst: @Zbyggy ah ty
[0:43:06] squires: Ooh, you got a good carnitas recipe?
[0:43:09] getdeepfried: viper is so good best adc in Korea
[0:43:32] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  when will teams stop giving Delight Rakan?
[0:43:41] lugubrieuzz: salsa verde would be killer but i don't think you'll find tomatillos tbh
[0:43:45] TangentCrab: It's so sad that hle has zeka :/
[0:43:58] Dreath1: I thought most people preferred botrk into shieldbow yone now?
[0:43:59] Mykah9: you just have to go to a naval base and you should be able to get tomatillos they are a standard in every comissary
[0:44:09] getdeepfried: zeka yone is actually good lol
[0:44:16] cryowizzzard: are you fluent in Korean
[0:44:18] MonteCristo: https://www.platingsandpairings.com/best-instant-pot-pork-carnitas/#wprm-recipe-container-13147
[0:44:31] DixMX: @MonteCristo thoughts on Anthony Bourdain? I just recently discovered him and he's so interesting
[0:44:45] najafan: Does fish make up more of your diet than it would in the US? It seems to be way more emphasized in Korean/Japanese media than it is in the US. Which makes sense, since almost everywhere is close to the water.
[0:44:53] Shimmerz: if you were to hang out with thorin or Richard IRL and not talk esports what would you do hanging with them
[0:45:04] sabbaer6666: was rly good

[0:47:31] kraethan: Yeah viper hard carries this game

[0:48:39] parkyr413: smolder frozen heart
[0:48:55] kalidios: Hes so strong
[0:49:01] DixMX: who is Smolder's mom?
[0:49:05] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  i dont know. he makes games boring because teams pick him and just afk farm
[0:49:11] FuumaX: subtract the voice lines and i agree
[0:49:11] lugubrieuzz: he doesn't have a giga overloaded kit to be a fun character for once
[0:49:14] killerwhalekj: it is fun to watch
[0:49:23] grandezelx: Nah he scales way too hard
[0:49:26] direpants2: how does this go on for 20 more minutes?
[0:49:30] mikejanderson: more fun than asol?
[0:49:35] grandezelx: Too fast
[0:49:49] GP2_HS: monte did you consider enchansing your vocab with stuff such as pepega, poggers, wideduckass, kappa, monkaS, gigachad etc? it would be funny
[0:49:50] eCabbage: his ult seemed very loud on the broadcast too
[0:49:53] brissings: Im just happy there is another viable late game adc aphelios xayah has gotten so boring over the years
[0:49:59] Shimmerz: do they have more than 200year of game design in him
[0:50:05] killerwhalekj: actually 30minutes
[0:50:05] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:50:13] gerbilsdontexist: they purposely made him annoying and stupid looking
[0:50:16] squires: He might scale too hard now, but his kit seems like it can be balanced, though.
[0:50:24] gerbilsdontexist: they want stupid cutesy design in all their champs now. that or waifus
[0:51:03] squires: Looks at Nefiri...
[0:51:06] brissings: Or kpop boys
[0:51:11] killerwhalekj: it is good for selling skins
[0:51:13] Fissiccisst: you know, cause when I think cute and waifu, I think Ksante

[0:51:20] moomookus: tru
[0:51:21] rfarleydude97: HUH
[0:51:22] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  you can trace it back to when Riot sold 100% of their shares to Tencent, this started in 2016. right away
[0:51:23] Shimmerz: do we know what the avg age of a Chinese lol player is
[0:51:24] ggezmayo: D:

[0:51:29] DrakeAcula: OMEGALUL
[0:51:30] DixMX: BASED
[0:51:31] TangentCrab: okay pop off monte
[0:51:34] NotZuraItsKatsura: we need to bring back the pizza feet lol aesthetic
[0:52:05] Shimmerz: name a champ more horny than reksai I’ll wait
[0:52:06] vikingrskald: I just think it’ll be hard to make skins for smolder that are unique and fun and not just crappy chromas
[0:52:11] brissings: Bring back the old poppy model
[0:52:23] killerwhalekj: why
[0:52:32] truthlol: are you going to try watching avatar the last airbender on netflix for nerd legion?
[0:52:40] killerwhalekj: what do u think of deft’s build
[0:52:41] Fissiccisst: @brissings Poppy
[0:52:49] rfarleydude97: Ooo
[0:53:00] najafan: @truthlol Can't wait for the hip hop secret tunnel remix.
[0:53:12] Fissiccisst: it hits viper but the shield ate it all LUL
[0:53:18] Dreamchosis: it hit viper, locket though
[0:53:18] DixMX: damn it mom, you are so useless
[0:53:29] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  delight on rakan is a cheat code
[0:53:41] gerbilsdontexist: he shouldnt ever get that champ
[0:53:41] rfarleydude97: also idk if i missed it at some point, but whens the next Foreplay?
[0:53:42] gerbilsdontexist: EVER
[0:53:48] Shimmerz: he didn’t get focus damage on anyone he spread his damage evenly and no kills
[0:53:52] Fissiccisst: is smolder just a better ziggs?
[0:54:01] gerbilsdontexist: no hes not
[0:54:13] rfarleydude97: Pyosik??
[0:54:17] rfarleydude97: that ult was kinda KEK
[0:54:26] gerbilsdontexist: smolder is a better ap kog maw
[0:54:36] direpants2: D:
[0:55:11] grandezelx: @montecristo monte did you watch the t1 games yet i think faker's hwei is probably the best i have seen in pro play so far.

[0:55:11] zen__cloud: do you think this year's MSI will be relatively low level macro compared to other years?
[0:55:44] saberaxe: deft is also on a low damage build
[0:55:44] hubertstephen: Smolder items are troll he needs damage
[0:55:51] IcarusFall_: pyosik inting this game
[0:55:57] parkyr413: @montecristo is the frozen heart on deft troll or not?
[0:56:00] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  Faker when hes on anything that requires no skill /s
[0:56:06] najafan: What style of Mexican?
[0:56:07] saberaxe: so the entire thing is letting his base damage cut through
[0:56:10] DixMX: it's because of Taco Buff
[0:56:14] DixMX: Pog
[0:56:23] Shimmerz: if wolf sponsors frozen pizza, what American item would Monte sponsor in Korea
[0:56:40] gh0ast98: Morning Monte (it's 6:30 here)
[0:56:42] rfarleydude97: thats cap, i was there for the last one. tho it made me very hungry
[0:56:47] rfarleydude97: KEKW
[0:56:51] spaceprincesssss: baby food cooking stream
[0:56:52] kraethan: Seems like korean and mexican food would be a good mix
[0:57:00] truthlol: i watched in the offseason it was really nice cause i could tell how much you loved cooking
[0:57:01] Krethas: I get the feeling that the vocal bunch asking for cooking streams are probably the younger viewers who can't cook
[0:57:04] awoogawooogawoo: how about the viewers set a goal donation for cooking stream?
[0:57:11] DixMX: @kraethan korean food in mexico goes hard
[0:57:42] IcarusFall_: @gerbilsdontexist hwei requires no skilll?
[0:57:43] zen__cloud: korean - mex fusion restaurants are so good
[0:57:48] gh0ast98: Bangers only food edition
[0:57:55] tyromancy29: Do you follow J Kenji Lopez alt at all?
[0:58:27] squires: There's this place in Austin called Chilantro that does Korean BBQ/tex mex fusion and it's so good.
[0:58:30] tyromancy29: Love kenji
[0:58:32] AdmiralReggie: wow
[0:58:36] direpants2: KEKW
[0:58:36] Dreath1: jesus christ what am I watching
[0:58:38] Dreath1: what is BDD doing
[0:58:43] trueaether: why is Viper so good, he could be on a team like GENG and we'd still find ways to say he's elohelled I swear
[0:58:45] iiTzLos: omg
[0:58:45] spaceprincesssss: average deft experience
[0:58:58] Shimmerz: this is the opposite of a macro blast, it’s a micro fizzle
[0:59:07] Mykah9: so what i am learning is that smolder is kogmaw 2.0?
[0:59:07] kraethan: Just pretend its zeri and play the same way
[0:59:42] nautcholibre: MOM!
[0:59:54] hubertstephen: If smolder had navori and bt instead of sojin/ frozen that would be a different fight
[0:59:58] gerbilsdontexist: thats on bdd 100%
[1:00:00] Dreath1: BDD sold that lmfao
[1:00:01] DixMX: we're going back to 2013 where I don't know what the fuck is going on the screen
[1:00:08] iiTzLos: lol
[1:00:24] awoogawooogawoo: how lose on 351 stacks
[1:00:24] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:00:37] gerbilsdontexist: god that aatrox is so fucking useless
[1:00:42] torgoat: im not an expert but this is a big yikeasaurus
[1:00:47] direpants2: how many teamfights were thrown this game for it to go on for 20 more minutes?
[1:01:06] killerwhalekj: what does smolder ult do btw
[1:01:16] Dreath1: @killerwhalekj carpet bomb
[1:01:16] theancientdreamer: viper is the best adc in the world
[1:02:03] gerbilsdontexist: look at aatrox. still building lethality
[1:02:04] gerbilsdontexist: unreal
[1:02:07] spaceprincesssss: does lck playoffs have losers bracket this year
[1:02:08] gerbilsdontexist: he is so usless.
[1:02:13] kumukarms: kumukarms subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Thanks for all the content Monte. Its a treat to have full match breakdowns but do miss your commentary
[1:02:15] nautcholibre: I can’t believe it KT frauds! I’m shocked! cristoWTF
[1:02:20] Shimmerz: is there any frozen heart value on deft I think he’s getting blown up too quick and out of range of passive most fights
[1:02:40] gerbilsdontexist: feels like he is getting more assassinated by aatrox than other way around
[1:02:59] kumukarms: I guess more like formal commentary (OGN and Overwatch)
[1:03:17] DixMX: holy shit Viper
[1:03:36] cryowizzzard: too be honest I wouldn’t expect that dmg either
[1:03:38] Evan_Ralston: looks like he did as he died
[1:03:45] gerbilsdontexist: did they buff varus E damage?
[1:03:48] nautcholibre: that’s a world champion! he gets a pass on not ulting!
[1:03:52] Fissiccisst: omg he did lose ult
[1:03:59] Nasacrim: Im glad deft is hardstuck in this team, he for sure had a hand getting his buddies together, now he gets what he deserves LUL
[1:04:08] tylerjenkinz: He was not prepared -Illidan
[1:04:16] spaceprincesssss: 3x worlds finalist beryl
[1:04:17] QuietLighter: this is probably the most impressive lethality varus game ive seen in recent memory
[1:04:22] theancientdreamer: i'm just in love with viper
[1:04:24] awoogawooogawoo: no way you lose with smolder
[1:04:25] zen__cloud: varus blight stacks feel hard to keep track of sometimes
[1:05:11] tylerjenkinz: varus the only one who can hit turret and he can't really step up
[1:05:26] gerbilsdontexist: Peanut is such a sejuani merchant lol
[1:05:26] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:05:26] nautcholibre: @montecristo since NA Is live do you think they will be setting the meta this year ?
[1:05:29] Shimmerz: Monte is there any frozen heart value in this build? seems like he’s getting mobbed and exploded when he gets ccd anyway
[1:05:37] najafan: @nautcholibre lol
[1:06:15] kalidios: 400 stacks is 13% edecute
[1:06:15] cryowizzzard: so does smolder peak at 250 stacks ? I know it keeps going up but it seems the champ doesn’t get any stronger I’ve had some 50 min games with shit dmg smolder 400 stacks
[1:06:21] nautcholibre: @najafan you know what I mean not that they will be good but other regions watching how patches are playing out before hand
[1:06:56] Shimmerz: I dunno I’m not seeing frozen heart impact any fights since he got it
[1:06:57] kalidios: Or 12 but its insane ye
[1:07:06] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  Kog maw cant get a better passive. and new adc has elder drake passive as an add on extra
[1:07:10] najafan: @nautcholibre Players will not. Will teams might have a few analysts looking for things that are promising? idk, probably. But that would be true anyhow.
[1:07:10] definitelynotkus: he has to keep grabbing resource even though his build is done though, so other players lose out on items
[1:07:28] nautcholibre: Quick someone do the math how many stacks for 50 percent health ?
[1:07:56] RawssDeBawss: 1920
[1:07:58] yanya7701: so this year worlds LCK team would be T1 Geng HLE and KT?
[1:08:00] Evan_Ralston: 1920
[1:08:01] Ritashi2: 1920
[1:08:13] nautcholibre: Jesus I don’t want to see that game! 😂
[1:08:14] AdmiralReggie: EZ
[1:08:14] killerwhalekj: Kappa
[1:08:21] Shimmerz: 20x40 - 80 easy math
[1:08:21] spaceprincesssss: doable like that long ass jin air game
[1:08:39] nuadore: so after afk farming 3920 stacks, he one shots from 100% max hp. EZ wins every time
[1:08:48] nautcholibre: montemath emote
[1:09:05] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  legitimately you can replace most top laners in pro play with an AI and the results would be the same.
[1:09:33] TuxedoMasquerade: Imagine taking Elder and the game goes on another 15min
[1:09:33] QuietLighter: Execute is on FoX
[1:09:37] theancientdreamer: @MonteCristo could smolder be played as a support?
[1:09:40] Shimmerz: he sold frozen heart for ga
[1:09:45] Limpy7030: does it stack with the elder dragon execute?
[1:09:52] AdmiralReggie: HUH
[1:09:53] nautcholibre: yes
[1:09:56] awoogawooogawoo: HUH
[1:09:58] divine_killjaeden: we no longer do T1 reviews?
[1:10:01] najafan: @theancientdreamer Any champion COULD.
[1:10:02] kalidios: Its fun vs asol
[1:10:05] najafan: But should they?
[1:10:10] QuietLighter: The Dot does
[1:10:12] nuadore: children are psychopaths though, he probably thinks it's a game
[1:10:12] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  why the fuck does he have arms AND wings
[1:10:13] direpants2: humans do it all the time. what's the big deal?
[1:10:14] hotblew1337: Is perfect a griefer for going full lethality in this game?
[1:10:20] Shimmerz: smoulder is actually the main character from 3 body problem, betrayed his own kind
[1:10:26] kalidios: Since there is a quest where you can get more stacks
[1:10:27] Shimmerz: main villain

[1:10:31] QuietLighter: but the execute is capped at the higher point iirc
[1:10:46] najafan: @Shimmerz True. Literally true.
[1:11:04] najafan: Smolder's designer is a misogynist confirmed.
[1:11:07] QuietLighter: he wants to spit
[1:11:12] UpYerArs: its almost 1am should i head to the gym or na help me out chat
[1:11:13] nautcholibre: he’s got that stack mentality
[1:11:27] nautcholibre: I have damage nothing can kill men
[1:11:27] najafan: And is pro CCP and hates the Uhygurs.
[1:11:30] AdmiralReggie: those minions were paid actors
[1:11:31] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  nobody built armor on the team so nobody can step up and eat varus Qs. someone should be building tank
[1:11:32] mintiik007: sej smitre for slow too
[1:11:52] Shimmerz: @najafan yep, I bet he operates a radio satellite
[1:12:04] QuietLighter: beryl learned he ulted right away lol
[1:12:07] divine_killjaeden: monte when are you doing the T1 games?
[1:12:13] najafan: Can Smolder pass the Piaget tests?
[1:12:15] spaceprincesssss: sad that hle isnt going to msi
[1:12:25] divine_killjaeden: ok ok
[1:12:40] WhatTheHay: u bet on new KT T1 odds?
[1:12:40] killerwhalekj: it was good series though
[1:12:42] nautcholibre: I think they should give Nasus Q an execute seems fair. it’s way harder to stack it
[1:12:45] Shimmerz: will you ever do a lord bet with wolf over if KT is a fraud or not
[1:12:46] najafan: Which Kohlberg stage is Smolder at, and why is it the second?
[1:13:10] boostmelpay: have you seen patch notes 14.4 yet?
[1:13:10] Mariiann_2002: the damage graph at the end of this game is a thing of beauty
[1:13:28] grandezelx: @montecristo do you think faker can be mvp this split?
[1:13:32] najafan: Okay, that last one has layers. I like that one.
[1:13:34] nautcholibre: 14.4 is gonna change the meta hardcore
[1:13:43] QuietLighter: this game was pretty much a 4v5 imo  perfect was invisible both games :(
[1:13:58] divine_killjaeden: i hate infinite stacking champions it always feels like theres a time bomb.
[1:14:10] direpants2: bdd KEKW
[1:14:20] Violet_Katt: got 3 ults out of that
[1:14:21] heckintim: @divine_killjaeden cuz they are
[1:14:29] nautcholibre: Kasante nerfs!!
[1:15:01] Shimmerz: zeka no deaths is this worlds 2022
[1:15:02] cryowizzzard: I feel like 50% of vision is ineffective in proplay
[1:15:09] squires: 45 minutes and pyosik still not max level. Jungle is fun
[1:15:14] WhatTheHay: he should have PD for boots swap
[1:15:49] Violet_Katt: Pyosik is so shit
[1:15:50] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:15:54] Shimmerz: let the hate flow through you
[1:16:04] divine_killjaeden: pyosik is trash unless he plays vs gengee or t1.
[1:16:06] najafan: @Violet_Katt Well his name is Pyoshit
[1:16:07] spaceprincesssss: the clock hit 12 and he turned into a pumpkin
[1:16:09] nautcholibre: what @montecristo mean to say is he’s a god not a fraud.
[1:16:17] killerwhalekj: wdym he is the best jungle in lck
[1:16:26] jeanbarreto001: ao vivo isso aqui ?
[1:16:33] WhatTheHay: I think it’s good @montecristo get jungle pick so then they can elder
[1:16:34] Violet_Katt: 10% of the time Pyosik is the best player ever 90% of the time hes a bot
[1:16:39] Dreath1: going from sylvie vi to pyosik vi is disturbing jesus
[1:16:40] ax_ell: Classic pyosik moment after popping off previous series
[1:16:45] spucky117: FRAUDS!
[1:16:53] litixio: 4 ults and aatrox flash
[1:17:14] Shimmerz: pyosik sees enemy jungler alone, neurons activate
[1:17:23] Shimmerz: what else is there to understabd
[1:17:35] nautcholibre: ok why not just back off after the sej kill real question?
[1:17:35] divine_killjaeden: its crazy how pyosik lv of play goes super saiyan vs gengee and t1.
[1:17:38] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  thats one useful aatrox
[1:17:46] boostmelpay: deft no boots hehe
[1:17:59] hotblew1337: Zilean Smolder lane = thousand year dragon
[1:18:02] najafan: Love the Aatrox
[1:18:07] divine_killjaeden: @hotblew1337 lol
[1:18:11] najafan: Love the Alistar
[1:18:26] nautcholibre: wait baron for elder cristoLCS
[1:18:26] Shimmerz: Evelyn smoulder lane, fuck dragons
[1:18:32] Dreath1: atlus is hilarious
[1:18:36] grandezelx: @montecristo i am sry you said zues is probably the best player in the world do you think faker can mvp over zues or chovy,cuzz or pyosik who are the other people in contention for mvp.
[1:18:42] QuietLighter: baron to stall the elder was the right call imo here
[1:18:59] divine_killjaeden: kt macro is that of a chicken with no head?
[1:19:09] DavP3rz: Tal, Aatrox and Alistar flash+R to kill the Tank
[1:19:25] spucky117: spucky117 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! another month of bangers... chipotle wraps, razor cakes, cake razors trash! cristoRACCOON
[1:19:27] QuietLighter: If history tells us anything
[1:19:40] QuietLighter: 2nd RR Muich more important for allpro/mvp  than 1st RR
[1:19:45] Mile1234567890: Mile1234567890 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:19:47] QuietLighter: which makes sense. Current form
[1:19:52] najafan: You know what would be great here?
[1:19:54] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo zeus or marin  for best top of t1 all time?
[1:19:55] najafan: Lulu.
[1:20:02] Giiino: how many stacks is he at now?
[1:20:08] najafan: Lulu on Smolder would be exquisite in the late game.
[1:20:11] Dreath1: zeus by far
[1:20:23] Shimmerz: Monte will you be participating in the EG files content or is that for Richard and thorin?
[1:20:27] najafan: And, wow, maybe she would have been better than Alistar in laning.
[1:20:38] itsDoukas: mvp is whoever on the first place team that has the most pogs
[1:20:38] najafan: Just something to think about.
[1:20:44] gerbilsdontexist: what the fuck is bdd doing???

[1:20:57] spucky117: smolder wave clear literally makes this match last 20 mins longer than it should...
[1:20:58] Dreath1: this is a horrific game from BDD
[1:21:00] definitelynotkus: yet smouler 6 item and on 3k
[1:21:05] hotblew1337: 4000 damage smolder r?
[1:21:19] Fissiccisst: @spucky117 isn't that why they gutted ziggs?
[1:21:20] Shimmerz: he sold boots
[1:21:31] QuietLighter: man that wave clear
[1:21:34] QuietLighter: from such long range
[1:21:39] divine_killjaeden: why i hate veigar
[1:21:53] Violet_Katt: "so many water" well said Atlas
[1:21:56] Fissiccisst: hes basically veigar, kog, and ziggs combined
[1:22:06] nautcholibre: I always sell boots in Aram but on rift that feels scary.
[1:22:07] divine_killjaeden: 2k extra damage on his q yaa.
[1:22:14] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  this was an average Jin Air game
[1:22:19] gerbilsdontexist: lol
[1:22:28] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo zeka should buy some lifestel no? like bt or shieldbow
[1:22:29] RawssDeBawss: Zeka hasn't died yet ooft.
[1:22:32] najafan: Is that like 543 stacks on Smolder?
[1:22:36] Shimmerz: LS is probably arguing he should buy liandries
[1:22:37] Dreath1: what the FUCK does aatrox have fucking opportunity for MY EYES MAN
[1:22:43] Shimmerz: actually wait that sounds good
[1:22:47] Dreath1: BUY A SUNDERED SKY
[1:22:51] divine_killjaeden: who was better marin or zeus?
[1:22:53] nautcholibre: it’s actually so hard to kill Yone
[1:23:17] Violet_Katt: lsGiga
[1:23:29] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  actually RFC yes for the Movespeed % because he sold boots!!!!
[1:23:36] awoogawooogawoo: lsGIGA
[1:23:46] divine_killjaeden: i hope the coach points it out in there vod review.
[1:23:51] myosotismenot: peepoFat nom
[1:23:59] QuietLighter: I feel like GA is the sell here
[1:24:03] achillesreel: He's got the bird move though.
[1:24:05] QuietLighter: if you die you die anyways
[1:24:05] gerbilsdontexist: I agree
[1:24:20] WhatTheHay: rift maker liandrys and PD
[1:24:21] Dreath1: honestly GA sell is pretty based
[1:24:31] azelikk: i mean, quickblade give +16% ability damage right now
[1:24:38] QuietLighter: i feel like the line of battle would be moved
[1:24:40] Nasacrim: he can sell all his items and buy 6 tears, his jungler is pyosik
[1:24:41] QuietLighter: during GA revive
[1:24:42] trueaether: GA is often a bait buy for that reason, but its good this game, their followup is kinda ass
[1:24:43] spucky117: zeka does change his build yes
[1:24:48] Shimmerz: the max health burn with poke and true damage execute
[1:24:52] killerpineapple1: and that %burn gets the bonuses from rift liandiys and spear its all  added in separate from what i understand
[1:24:54] nautcholibre: @montecristo ok real question we agree HLE is better the KT but is KT holding HLE here or is HLE just playing bad?
[1:24:55] Shimmerz: sounds good
[1:25:01] najafan: I can't quite see the stacks on smolder, but I think he has >550 now and execute is at like 16% of health.
[1:25:06] divine_killjaeden: bloodthirster?
[1:25:33] Shimmerz: so we can equivocally say they lost to shop keeper as a single tear sheds down the liandry mask
[1:25:35] Dreath1: BDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[1:25:37] Dreath1: WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[1:26:08] yanya7701: what

[1:26:16] yanya7701: didnt he ult the Alistar
[1:26:19] Shimmerz: it’s ok he has ga
[1:26:22] Dreath1: wait BDD's ult was genuinely game losing lmfao
[1:26:24] gerbilsdontexist: man Delight is a god
[1:26:31] boostmelpay: look at viper damage
[1:26:32] divine_killjaeden: 600 stacks
[1:26:35] WhatTheHay: BDD R bad
[1:26:36] trueaether: HLE bot lane holding this team together
[1:26:37] boostmelpay: LOOK AT VIPER DAMAAHGE AHAHA
[1:26:45] nautcholibre: elder on 4 is better then on one smolder
[1:26:46] TuxedoMasquerade: 11k Viper damage holyyyyy
[1:26:47] QuietLighter: The GA kept him alive from dying as soon as yone got him I guess
[1:26:54] definitelynotkus: its not unlucky, its par for the course KT game
[1:27:03] hotblew1337: Also def should have gotten the fruit after flashing out
[1:27:10] yanya7701: wait how did he even get in range to ult Yone
[1:27:17] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  can we have an intervention here right now. BDD is a huge career choker
[1:27:20] trueaether: HLE might have the best bot lane in the world
[1:27:24] najafan: Hard not to feel that Nami and Lulu might have helped more than Alistar here.
[1:27:27] Shimmerz: tears shed down the liandry mask in the back of the shopkeepers pack knowing what if
[1:27:30] dowiet: the snotbubbles of death
[1:27:32] Limpy7030: if deft flashes yone ult he might kill everyone imo
[1:27:33] gravitum_uwu: viper my god
[1:27:40] yanya7701: what
[1:27:44] Mariiann_2002: Viper didnt even lose his spell shield, wtf man, positioning masterclass
[1:27:50] gerbilsdontexist: when does Taliyah start doing damage! WHEN
[1:27:55] Violet_Katt: Deft D key just not workin
[1:27:57] forgefather: That bdd ult was so troll
[1:27:57] yanya7701: can you still ult him when he uses ult
[1:28:02] yanya7701: I mean Yone
[1:28:07] WhatTheHay: huge BBD Ew combo
[1:28:10] WhatTheHay: BDD
[1:28:20] gerbilsdontexist: Yeah, HUGE for HLE, he brought them closer to Deft!
[1:28:21] boostmelpay: he is too old to flash tha
[1:28:21] Dreath1: BDD zoned his own team off
[1:28:29] spucky117: perfect flashes back in
[1:28:34] spucky117: deft doesnt hit honey fruit
[1:28:54] Xaicro: Viper is chill though and still has heal
[1:29:02] Zay7ay: I doubt HLE comnmits as hard/plays it the same if deft is full health but yes agree he needed to flash it
[1:29:10] offcorser: Thoughts on Smolder? His stacks for execute seems a bit too low imo. Should be getting it around 30 minutes, not 20.
[1:29:20] trueaether: viper shits out so much damage
[1:29:27] Dreath1: idk alistar has like 4 people on him Delight should 100% die there
[1:29:27] trueaether: he breaks 10k
[1:29:28] Shimmerz: side with more conditional engage wins
[1:29:33] QuietLighter: The wall maybe made the fight worse. Not flashing Yone ULt was fight losing
[1:29:45] gerbilsdontexist: I dont understand why teams dont pick miss fortune and a bunch of tanks
[1:29:50] yanya7701: yeah Deft lost that fight
[1:30:01] spucky117: waht q does perfect flash back in on
[1:30:11] spucky117: looks like he flashes on q 1 or 2
[1:30:18] zoneado: zoneado subscribed with Prime. 
[1:30:18] RawssDeBawss: Ultra Late Game, Jin Air has entered the chat XD
[1:30:19] boostmelpay: how is pysoik not full build at 50 mins
[1:30:21] najafan: I mean, Deft messed up, but so did picking Aatrox and Alistar imo.
[1:30:24] nautcholibre: @montecristo 55 min game reminds me of season 3
[1:30:33] najafan: Other picks would have helped with that mistake.
[1:30:37] Shimmerz: did pyosik learn the throw in dragon pit technique in NA like the rammus pick
[1:30:50] hotblew1337: @boostmelpay 10k spejnt on pinks 3k on potions and deft 600 farm for stacks
[1:30:50] Fissiccisst: Do you think league would be more interesting if a coach could be in comms during a game? @MonteCristo
[1:30:51] spucky117: also zeka changing his build after 45 mins
[1:31:09] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo the varus nerf in patch 14.4 hit on-hit varus more than lethality, agree?
[1:31:09] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:31:15] QuietLighter: I think league would be more interesting if we could listen to team comms
[1:31:18] mikejanderson: @hotblew1337 10k spent on pinks sounds so insane
[1:31:19] Mariiann_2002: that damage graph is hilarious
[1:31:22] Shimmerz: zero death zeka
[1:31:23] WaystedMined: "I told you to smite at 1199 HP"
[1:31:28] offcorser: Is it csgo that allows a coach to talk during the game?
[1:31:31] gerbilsdontexist: teams need to bring out the ziggs to counter varus
[1:31:33] QuietLighter: I would pay 15$ a month to listen in on team comms
[1:31:34] killerwhalekj: having faker on comm would be too op
[1:31:35] trueaether: in-game coaching would hurt players like Faker's ability to have unique impact
[1:31:39] hotblew1337: @mikejanderson its a joke but the rest of it isnt
[1:31:41] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo the varus nerf in patch 14.4 hit on-hit varus more than lethality, agree? ---
[1:31:45] pandagrog: @QuietLighter some leagues already have that and it ruined the pacing of the game too much
[1:31:58] najafan: @trueaether On the other hand, Hai could come back.
[1:32:17] mikejanderson: @hotblew1337 im just gullible as fuck OMEGALUL
[1:32:20] najafan: MAOKAI LESSGO
[1:32:21] Shimmerz: it’s the chilly women
[1:32:28] QuietLighter: @pandagrog oh like after fights? I think theres a lot of that but I mean live while the game is going on
[1:32:46] gerbilsdontexist: tbf every mediocre top laner is a ksante merchant
[1:32:55] hotblew1337: @mikejanderson he did buy like hella elixers tho and deft was taking every wave and camp from him even at 7 items
[1:33:11] gerbilsdontexist: but they picked Taliyah, the negative damage mage
[1:33:22] hotblew1337: @gerbilsdontexist ????????????????????????????
[1:33:28] QuietLighter: IMO udyr wins the game for HLE here
[1:33:32] najafan: They did miss out on Maokai, but c'est la vie
[1:33:35] mikejanderson: @hotblew1337 yeah i can imagine it might be worth for stacks
[1:33:41] najafan: Nice
[1:33:43] Shimmerz: this is a lot of responsibility on zeka this game
[1:33:56] pandagrog: @QuietLighter no i meant during fights. NA had it for a little bit and it was weird.
[1:34:05] hotblew1337: @mikejanderson its def not worth it at 6 items for deft to lose out on entire items for vi
[1:34:07] sabbaer6666: is that a shivana?
[1:34:11] gerbilsdontexist: Giving Delight Rakan should be a federal crime!!!
[1:34:18] Shimmerz: zeka the only tank buster on HLE
[1:34:21] QuietLighter: @pandagrog ah okay. More than fights I want to listen to what each team does between objective setups lol haha
[1:35:19] trueaether: why tf is there a jhin, this champ is too awful
[1:35:33] Ryan_T89: How many champions are actually in proper rotation at a time it feels like you never see some champs played ever?
[1:35:57] trueaether: this game it feels like you are hitting high armor frontline or nothing as jhin, minus ult
[1:36:06] edenjtv: what do you use to draw on screen?
[1:36:49] edenjtv: Ty bud

[1:36:57] QuietLighter: Vintage Udyr game inc
[1:37:04] parkyr413: why does epicpen feel like it should be doing a cross promo with freeze pipe?
[1:37:48] ADrugge: I think I'm pretty over K'sante in every game at this point.
[1:38:16] trueaether: Can we agree that Udyr is a better every game champ
[1:38:33] nautcholibre: @montecristo I’m pretty  sure it’s gonna gut him.
[1:38:35] najafan: @trueaether No, but we can agree Mao is
[1:38:58] myosotismenot: iwdGOAT
[1:39:03] parkyr413: I will trade K’Sante every game for Corki every game
[1:39:05] henxry934: is zeka finally back on melee champs?
[1:39:08] trueaether: @najafan that's fair, though I prefer when First Strike was still a strong option
[1:39:19] ADrugge: Can we just have some variety instead?
[1:39:25] sillycoomer69: why hle picked jhin huh
[1:39:36] Elysian_Shine: would be interesting to see league with old maokai ult in current year. Esp with all the insane damage in the game
[1:39:41] QuietLighter: @sillycoomer69 great follow up CC from his teams engage
[1:39:52] trueaether: also jhin doesn't care about sivir
[1:40:09] najafan: @Elysian_Shine AP Bruiser Fizz back with a vengance? I don't mind if I do.
[1:40:15] Kudegraw: The only difference is in solo queue the enemy udyr would have done twice the damage Doran just did somehow.
[1:40:20] nautcholibre: I am spam pinging the shit out of my laner if he does that
[1:40:51] trueaether: how did delight get rakan 2 games
[1:41:25] Mizzzraim: people forgot it should be respected
[1:42:07] Shimmerz: zeka has to carry his comp though right it seems low damage otherwise

[1:42:21] Shimmerz: jhin can’t kill tanks fast and they have sej ksante
[1:42:27] stevethekind: how crucial are grubs at this level of the game monte?
[1:42:28] killerwhalekj: hle is different team when zeka is on melee champ
[1:42:29] WhatTheHay: @montecristo are Korean teams favoring grubs or early drag more?
[1:42:37] gerbilsdontexist: lol look at how stupid udyr looks
[1:42:54] ADrugge: K'sante has an 82.3% presence in LCK spring so far. lol
[1:42:58] offcorser: Udyr looks like a GIGACHAD
[1:43:04] trueaether: full AP maokai time
[1:43:09] najafan: Mao could build AP
[1:43:10] trueaether: where's blaber
[1:43:13] QuietLighter: The Sej is so behind
[1:43:14] najafan: He does it all!
[1:43:16] Zzmarr: This game just brought me great sadness
[1:43:25] offcorser: Is first strike red pokemon maokai dead?
[1:43:31] hotblew1337: @MonteCristo HLE have a sneaky amount of magic daamge with YONE doing 50% magic udyr magic rakan magic and maoki
[1:43:41] Kaniskion: HUH
[1:43:41] Thaiestro: I remember shit dildo
[1:43:42] Elysian_Shine: Old trundle looked so much better
[1:43:48] BubbaGuamje: You can use the classic trundle skin
[1:43:49] UpYerArs: shit dildo not as hygenic
[1:43:58] parkyr413: @montecristo have you given a summary opinion on the seasonal changes now that we’re half a split in?
[1:43:59] kosstossa: shit dildo doesnt sound fun at all
[1:44:01] Fissiccisst: does the classic skin bring it back?
[1:44:19] gerbilsdontexist: traditional trundle
[1:44:21] Violet_Katt: got that taco bell dildo
[1:44:30] spucky117: i miss cigar graves...
[1:44:32] UpYerArs: Woah Monte Riot doesn't condone war or any negative stuff
[1:44:34] Kudegraw: The shit dildo isn't suppose to be a good time for you...
[1:44:44] nautcholibre: “I’m the troll king. KING!”
[1:44:56] WhatTheHay: are Korean teams favoring grubs or early drag more? @montecristo
[1:45:00] killerwhalekj: adc graves was slick
[1:45:01] Thaiestro: Cigar graves is gone? Riot
[1:45:10] Elysian_Shine: Riot does such strange changes, like making graves a jungler for some reason
[1:45:18] najafan: He smokes another type of cigar now.
[1:45:22] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  thanks China
[1:45:25] Mizzzraim: alcoholism is funny too :)
[1:45:28] nautcholibre: I miss the old graves gun animation. So smooth.
[1:45:36] ADrugge: LoL is my poison of choice.
[1:45:42] Nasacrim: Im just glad its not vape graves
[1:45:44] nautcholibre: Those autos feel nice
[1:45:47] Wolfmanmoore: Chinese society
[1:45:47] pandagrog: Sadly thats legit all over the world lmao
[1:45:47] nuadore: I miss "I'm not heartless. I love beating" on old Trundle
[1:45:50] parkyr413: society is crumbling around us anyhow
[1:45:54] TakinR: tar is too obviously poisonous to tolerate
[1:45:55] casperrrem: just do coke
[1:45:59] buzzkill00: iqos graves
[1:45:59] QuietLighter: Asia is pulling back from cigs too
[1:46:01] Mizzzraim: shouldn't they put a vape in graves' mouth?
[1:46:05] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  no but they literally changed it because of the splash, they actually changed the splash art first in china
[1:46:09] Thaiestro: There's still smoking areas in Japan, china
[1:46:10] nautcholibre: lol
[1:46:11] QuietLighter: but yea
[1:46:14] QuietLighter: growing up in korea
[1:46:14] najafan: Nah, China is why his new cigar is on the DL.
[1:46:16] QuietLighter: EVERYUONE SMOKRED
[1:46:18] zoneado: can concur
[1:46:19] Violet_Katt: Americans try not to impose their values on other cultures challenge impossible
[1:46:41] hotblew1337: Replacing smoking cigar w/ smoking dick is fosho a california move not a chinese thing
[1:46:41] Thaiestro: Can we sink California?
[1:46:52] UpYerArs: do we get an opium induced champion or would the Chinese get too triggered
[1:46:53] najafan: Other cultures try not to be objectively inferior to America impossible
[1:47:00] Nargy: Good old opium dens
[1:47:06] pandagrog: @najafan KKona DAMN RIGHT
[1:47:24] spucky117: it was part of the general wave of child proofing games

[1:47:30] Karego: Second hand smoking sucks tho
[1:47:36] WaystedMined: You drinking doesn't cause me to take it too
[1:47:38] pandagrog: Well they tried to do something about that in the 1920s and..
[1:47:42] zen__cloud: yea but @MonteCristo the SOCIAL ASPECT of drinking Kappa
[1:47:46] Elysian_Shine: Riot taking a social stand is just cringe, as they are putting chinese spyware on it's consumers next patch
[1:47:48] nautcholibre: @montecristo did you like the chance to graves to jungle or did you like him in a bot lane roll ? I liked him as an AD
[1:47:52] UpYerArs: consuming tobacco doesnt lead  to car accidents but alcohol does, Riot hmmmm
[1:47:52] WhatTheHay: alcohol is not anywhere near as addictive as cigarettes and 2nd hand smoke sucks outside or not the wind
[1:47:55] QuietLighter: ya designated smoking areas should be a thing
[1:47:57] rilsolo: but my ozone Pepehands
[1:47:59] nautcholibre: change*
[1:48:01] spucky117: blizzard went back and repainted tons of busty dwarves  in WoW
[1:48:01] OnTheRhodeAgain: I think the problem is they cant ban alcohol because its too easy to make
[1:48:03] moonglaives: Smokers also look super cool EZ
[1:48:07] Kudegraw: It's muh constitutional right to drink alcohol.
[1:48:07] zero_null: Social media and cellphones quietly sitting in a corner hoping no one notices how addictive it is
[1:48:07] arandomcrimson: ask any military person...
[1:48:08] QuietLighter: SMoke breaks are SO BIG in Korea
[1:48:09] TakinR: or any european
[1:48:09] deft4691: It is worse being around people smoking than people drinking IMO
[1:48:10] HenArcade: LOL As an ex smoker, the social aspect of smoking is BIG DEAL
[1:48:10] Alyxed: my county put in a no smoking indoors policy before covid and people were so mad
[1:48:11] buzzkill00: im middle eastern can confirm
[1:48:14] killerwhalekj: tobacco is more addictive than weed actually
[1:48:16] Sjkaev: smoking is literally networking
[1:48:17] casperrrem: are you for a legislation of some hard drugs
[1:48:18] Fissiccisst: the only reason anyone starts smoking is because of the social aspect I'm convinced
[1:48:18] spucky117: as a smoker....
[1:48:20] QuietLighter: like you socialize with people so much during smoke breaks in korea   lol
[1:48:27] buzzkill00: smokes and coffee
[1:48:30] saberaxe: Even for Americans there was a communal aspect in smoke breaks
[1:48:33] UpYerArs: lebanon chain smokers are on another level
[1:48:37] clippityycloppityy: the carcinogenic risk of smoking is much higher than alcohol but in general I agree w you
[1:48:40] spucky117: i met the best people smoking
[1:48:42] najafan: @pandagrog I'm sorry that I like freedom, gay rights, abortion, science, women being able to work, and burgers. I'm just an American. It's my culture to force it on others.
[1:48:43] Kudegraw: Is Tobacco addictive or is the nicotine? Legit question.
[1:48:52] moonglaives: bring back Joe Camel
[1:48:53] ADrugge: It's a religious thing, no? Can't ban the blood of Christ you know? xddd
[1:48:54] Dreamchosis: hookah networking
[1:49:01] Mile1234567890: the tobacco lobby lost to anheuser busch
[1:49:04] swagasaurus99: you’ve got a point. I’ve never heard of someone smoking a pack of cigs and then slamming a truck into a family of 4 in a minivan
[1:49:04] hotblew1337: holy fuck 30 cs jungle gap at 11:30 is crazy @MonteCristo
[1:49:06] bolt0s_2: a;cohol causes so much more ectra cost from fights and destruction
[1:49:10] wackylattice: Korean squat while smoking
[1:49:10] Karego: Because then you segregate smoking and non-smoking. Thereby suggesting smoking 'doesnt belong' in the 'normal' areas
[1:49:11] UpYerArs: @pandagrog what abortion lil bro they are banning it
[1:49:25] najafan: @UpYerArs Give it a decade.
[1:49:25] QuietLighter: @wackylattice while wearing adidas slippers
[1:49:29] lolznaga: Graves cant have a cigar. He can have a huge shotgun though KKona
[1:49:39] pandagrog: @najafan KKona i dont know about that other stuff but burgers mmm
[1:49:48] UpYerArs: America will be run by the Chinese or Indians in a decade
[1:49:49] saberaxe: Its even in alot of movies here, smoke breaks from work (retail, fast food) where 2 people have  deep conversation
[1:50:01] Karego: Lead poisoning Kappa
[1:50:02] yanya7701: @UpYerArs what? no
[1:50:10] pandagrog: @UpYerArs China already rules the world bud your late
[1:50:13] Kodord: OMEGALUL
[1:50:13] Kudegraw: Gragas THROWS ALCOHOL AT PEOPLE!
[1:50:14] najafan: @UpYerArs lol, might want to check in on China there fam.
[1:50:15] freddaxyz: and animals
[1:50:15] Nargy: At least he doesn't vape
[1:50:21] buzzkill00: hes defending himself Monte
[1:50:21] Fissiccisst: hey, if Dick Cheney can do it, so can Graves
[1:50:21] kosstossa: maybe they can make a skin where graves has a vape or maybe a 'kazoo'
[1:50:22] Mizzzraim: didnt you know killing is fine?
[1:50:25] lolznaga: Riot telling people what you're allowed to put in your mouth smh
[1:50:27] Ryan_T89: and having a smoke bomb
[1:50:32] hotblew1337: Graves canonic vaper when
[1:50:36] wackylattice: @quietlighter I didn’t see korean smokers with adidas slippers while I was in Korea
[1:50:38] Dreamchosis: also "crime city graves" doesnt hit the same as mafia graves
[1:50:42] parkyr413: @montecristo I actually think it’s legitimately the old Joe Camel law
[1:50:45] Shimmerz: next they will tell us they have to get rid of brand since his character is also smoking
[1:50:45] achillesreel: Evelyn eats your soul but Graves cant smoke.
[1:50:46] myosotismenot: don't tell riot, they might change it to a water gun
[1:50:57] zen__cloud: i don't understand why riot tries to bring political things into league and just keep it as the fantasy video game it is
[1:51:05] Nargy: The shotgun doesn't kill people, Graves does
[1:51:07] spucky117: yeah cant promote tabacco to kids
[1:51:11] QuietLighter: @wackylattice ah maybe its changed now hevent been to in like a decade.  Kids would wear adidas workout pants/slippers and squat while smoking. And spitting lol
[1:51:17] Shimmerz: brand is a walking cigar
[1:51:17] trueaether: both teams are kinda bulky but also low damage early
[1:51:19] pandagrog: @zen__cloud newsflash! fantasy is political wow!
[1:51:22] hotblew1337: OFC this game i had over on kills and it ended up this way
[1:51:24] hotblew1337: after last lol
[1:51:27] Mile1234567890: could the cigar have run afoul of child advertising laws?
[1:51:27] zoneado: so why haven't they nerfed Udyr yet?
[1:51:40] najafan: @Nargy Isn't it like canonically magical? We can blame magic.
[1:51:44] turtles223: Careful monte they might put the squirt gun in all of his skins
[1:51:54] UpYerArs: How come they tell us to not drink and drive but need a drivers license to buy alcohol?
[1:52:12] WhatTheHay: what’s the point in playing tank junglers to afk farm for 12mins, there’s no way this is the proper jg meta when brand and Lillia exist on this patch
[1:52:30] najafan: @pandagrog Newsflash: Things in the world we live in are effected by politics. omg

[1:52:43] Karego: seems like it was a spit... nvm you said it
[1:52:46] Thaiestro: Wuta the diff between yone and yasuo
[1:52:47] Karego: split*
[1:52:53] BubbaGuamje: God I want BDD and Deft to succeed but just not as much as I want pyosik and beryl to fail
[1:52:58] Thaiestro: They look like same abilities
[1:53:14] offcorser: @Thaiestro Uhh... a lot lmao
[1:53:28] wiisoka: @BubbaGuamje why do you want beryl and pyosik to fail ?
[1:53:35] WhatTheHay: ocean insane here
[1:53:38] trueaether: @wiisoka frauds
[1:53:42] najafan: Okay, can I say something without judgement here?
[1:53:43] Kudegraw: I think the talia could have walled the engage on Moakai. Sej could have possibly lived.
[1:54:10] pandagrog: @Thaiestro Yone is better and Yasuo is worse.
[1:54:16] wiisoka: @trueaether lil bro, beryl won his second world championship while playing genshin, he's the GOAT
[1:54:18] najafan: Deft is a decent name for if I have a boy.
[1:54:27] najafan: I might consider it.
[1:54:39] spucky117: deft is an adjective not a noun
[1:54:44] najafan: It's a bit weird, but I think it slaps.
[1:54:46] sabbaer6666: @najafan plz dont?!
[1:54:53] ADrugge: Also Graves title is literally "the outlaw." Makes sense for him to smoke if he's a bad guy.
[1:54:58] Shimmerz: you should name him ppgod instead, better league name
[1:55:06] najafan: @Shimmerz Very true.
[1:55:06] AdmiralReggie: man he baited his team so badly
[1:55:06] clippityycloppityy: pyosik is the duality of man
[1:55:07] pandagrog: @Shimmerz BASED
[1:55:08] offcorser: Im gonna name my kid Quick :)
[1:55:12] BubbaGuamje: @wiisoka For every solid game they have they follow with 10 disgusting egregious run downs
[1:55:15] trinhanvu: can't believe GenG lose to these guys
[1:55:15] clippityycloppityy: pumpkin or princess
[1:55:24] SimplyJunJun: how do you go from sweeping GenG in the last series to this mess lol
[1:55:29] kingkevin619: kt vs t1 Aware
[1:55:41] dredge4six: i cant be fooled by good lee sin mechanics, pyosik been a fraud
[1:55:45] spucky117: LOL wolf called himself on his own take this week
[1:56:01] Shimmerz: that deserves the fraud buzzer
[1:56:06] mikejanderson: was lee sin banned this series?
[1:56:12] kosstossa: pyosik getting his int out before the telecom wars
[1:56:18] spucky117: do we have a FRAUD button emote
[1:56:26] trueaether: @kosstossa do they play tonight?
[1:56:28] wiisoka: @BubbaGuamje i know, but wanting them to fail seems a bit extreme (?
[1:56:31] Fissiccisst: Maokai runs ALL the way from baron to bot for that ult from the river LUL
[1:56:31] Shimmerz: FRAUD ALERT kt can’t pilot their comp
[1:56:38] QuietLighter: Beryl moving in enemy JG like hes playing alistair
[1:56:38] sillycoomer69: losing to jhin PepeLaugh
[1:56:53] nautcholibre: I convinced my soon to be wife to name our first daughter Taliyah, unfortunately she didn’t want to name our first boy Naut or Cho gath.
[1:57:06] Fioraoraoraoraoraoraora: playing the picked comp
[1:57:07] kosstossa: @trueaether saturday
[1:57:35] najafan: Monte missing the discourse as to whether "Deft" is a good name for a boy.

[1:57:39] najafan: (Yes, yes it is.)
[1:57:51] najafan: (It slaps.)
[1:57:51] nautcholibre: @montecristo maybe if you have a good argument I can give her we might be able to change her mind
[1:57:55] Shimmerz: I think a yone ban is due against zeta, the one champ he can play right now
[1:57:57] deft4691: rammus would be an ok name for a boy
[1:58:04] Fissiccisst: Tell your wife to name your daughter Cho, pretend its for Cho Change from Harry Potter, but its actually Cho Gath
[1:58:12] Fissiccisst: Chang*
[1:58:32] Karego: when in doubt, all in for the enemy toplaner
[1:58:32] tyromancy29: is jhin rakan good?
[1:58:43] nautcholibre: @fissiccisst Yea I tired that argument. it’s a no go lol
[1:58:54] Fissiccisst: I tried dolphinDerp
[1:59:12] RoughRunner98: kt is pretty low range so i feel like its ok
[1:59:19] trueaether: where is ezreal in this region, It feels rare
[1:59:25] nautcholibre: she said if we get a dog I can name is Cho gath 😂
[1:59:34] Fissiccisst: thats a great dog name
[1:59:35] nautcholibre: not good enough
[1:59:36] QuietLighter: we had a lot of ezreal week 1~2 on LCK iirc
[1:59:41] Shimmerz: is yone zekas only champ this patch he isn’t balls on
[1:59:51] SheaMoon: I named my dog Peanut
[1:59:53] trueaether: @Shimmerz Akali
[2:00:07] Karego: Why doesnt anyone wanna name their kid garen? Kappa
[2:00:08] Fissiccisst: I wanna get a dog, name it either Garrus or Tali based on the gender
[2:00:20] Shimmerz: is he going 6 - 0 on akali tho?
[2:00:25] trueaether: mayhaps
[2:00:33] RoughRunner98: idk about these walls from bdd
[2:00:37] yanya7701: that taliyah ult was kinda bold lol
[2:01:41] najafan: @nautcholibre have you tried nagakabouros?
[2:01:48] RoughRunner98: 0% zeka told his team hes going
[2:01:51] parkyr413: good night Monte
[2:02:03] RoughRunner98: wait nvm
[2:02:07] Karego: wait, why didnt mao ult
[2:02:16] Shimmerz: maoki getting thrown over the wall too is cringe from peanut
[2:02:18] trueaether: BDD is a player of some skill certainly
[2:02:20] deft4691: you can see the line of the return right?
[2:02:21] RoughRunner98: he saw him snap back
[2:02:32] trinhanvu: well not blind he can see him going back
[2:02:37] yanya7701: theres a line of Yone
[2:02:38] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:02:42] trueaether: the timing is really insane though
[2:02:45] beauds69: he wouldnt see the exact spot
[2:02:55] QuietLighter: its like calculating siege tank range in fog of war
[2:03:02] QuietLighter: elementary for pro players i assume
[2:03:04] yanya7701: yeah except that line it was blind
[2:03:35] Karego: he jsut wasnt paying attention
[2:03:41] yanya7701: that Yone engage is kinda forced
[2:03:44] grandezelx: I still cant believe ls gave deft his name
[2:03:54] nautcholibre: yea they have to run from the moa R or they just die
[2:04:01] trinhanvu: pretty sure the tether would still end where he snap back it's just dimed because of FOW
[2:04:03] Fissiccisst: I think zeka was just intending to poke and got cc blasted
[2:04:06] trueaether: would you say that BDD has been the second best mid in lck or does it go to faker?
[2:04:16] RoughRunner98: i thought that too but hes pretty in sync with udyr
[2:04:23] RoughRunner98: the engage
[2:04:32] AdmiralReggie: monkaS
[2:04:33] trinhanvu: @trueaether not with that wall LUL
[2:04:38] QuietLighter: udyr was always going to be there to be annoying
[2:04:46] AlsoValley: who are your top 3?
[2:05:25] trueaether: Showmaker probably could have been in that convo if he kept up the performances after GENG
[2:05:28] QuietLighter: IM pretty sure Zeka was yelling  GANDA GANDA GANDA GANDA
[2:05:29] nautcholibre: It’s a Yone thing.
[2:05:29] RoughRunner98: @QuietLighter yeah its hard to tell hes walking up
[2:06:00] paddlestar_gallactica: more like aTone
[2:06:05] RoughRunner98: zeka couldnt fight the masculine yone urge to engage over a wall... ive been there
[2:06:20] nautcholibre: Sometimes Yone brain just takes over, and next thing you know your E deep In the enemy and dead soon after lol.
[2:06:30] BubbaGuamje: Does it even make sense to build LDR on Jhin here? Would he ever actually do any damage to either ksante or sej? Would it make sense to just commit to more lethality? I actually dont know I might just be a pleb
[2:07:01] Fissiccisst: its probably just that they're most likely in range for jhin to hit
[2:07:13] yanya7701: was the RNG TES series good? If not, im going to bed
[2:07:25] QuietLighter: ya the squishies are always going to be behind the sen or ksante during fights i
[2:07:39] vanKaaskop: LDR might not be the optimal 2nd item but it allows you to be flexible with your 3rd
[2:07:39] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:07:45] vanKaaskop: optimal dmg item*
[2:07:56] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  is Taliyah the Vi of Mid lane?
[2:08:03] gerbilsdontexist: the Renekton of mid lane
[2:08:15] yanya7701: @gerbilsdontexist Taliyah and VI are actually very good combo duo
[2:08:23] gerbilsdontexist: i think she sucks
[2:08:43] trueaether: @yanya7701 I think its really stompy, idk if that's enough to go off of though
[2:08:44] gerbilsdontexist: i think teams should play anivia instead
[2:08:45] RoughRunner98: @gerbilsdontexist bdd isnt doing the ult justice this game lol
[2:08:50] QuietLighter: side laning vs a taliyah comp is a nightmare
[2:09:09] nautcholibre: I suck at her and I got like 20 kills on Aram lol@
[2:09:12] najafan: Also she can be flexed jg
[2:09:13] Fissiccisst: KT playing badly? say it isn't so
[2:09:16] Zay7ay: cho gath > thalia
[2:09:18] gerbilsdontexist: good thing nobody side lanes in a game where dragons spawn every 5 seconds
[2:09:35] AkibaBoi: @MonteCristo Hope you are doing well, your casting back in Overwatch was always my favourite
[2:09:37] offcorser: @gerbilsdontexist KEKW
[2:09:44] nautcholibre: @zay7ay not according to my wife
[2:09:45] AnnoraxTV: With enchanters like Soraka and Lulu getting buffs do you think it is possible we will see enchanters make a comeback in pro?
[2:10:00] QuietLighter: udyr's dream lol
[2:10:09] Zay7ay: @nautcholibre shoulda left it to a chat vote :P
[2:10:23] najafan: @AnnoraxTV They were already strong enough to see play tbh.
[2:10:24] RoughRunner98: tp?
[2:10:28] riley_bruce_: @AnnoraxTV not until crit ADs are buffed. you have to think of the lane pairings
[2:10:28] najafan: People just hate em
[2:10:31] Zebrios: Man Monte seriously called the KT turning into pumpkins at midnight with this series.  KT looked SO bad.
[2:10:40] gerbilsdontexist: I think teams should play veigar mid instead of Taliyah
[2:10:58] nautcholibre: “Sorry babe chat says we should name our kid Cho gath.” chat has spoken
[2:11:07] Zebrios: The razor cake has been completed.
[2:11:33] riley_bruce_: despair
[2:11:39] Zebrios: Udyr tanks like 7 turret shots.
[2:11:44] RoughRunner98: udyr proxy farming
[2:11:46] najafan: @nautcholibre Have you suggested Viego? It's close enough to a normal name she might go for it.
[2:11:47] Fissiccisst: Spell Shield this you filthy casual ~Udyr
[2:11:54] Shimmerz: is Doran in his career peak for ?
[2:11:59] riley_bruce_: the Pyosik special xdd
[2:12:03] wiisoka: @Zebrios i mean, they almost lost against DRX, the smell of fraud was in the air
[2:12:05] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  bdd is worse than Pyoshit this series tbf
[2:12:08] QuietLighter: doran's lck summer last year was very impressive I'd say that was his peak
[2:12:14] Zebrios: I don't think this was all on Pyosik though.  BDD played like ass.
[2:12:19] gerbilsdontexist: am a big bdd stan but come on
[2:12:32] Zebrios: BDD got gapped by ZEKA
[2:12:45] gerbilsdontexist: zeka didnt really even do much last game bdd just didnt do anything at all

[2:13:45] Zebrios: BeryL thought he was Keria
[2:13:46] nautcholibre: @najafan she calls viego the sad sword guy.
[2:13:46] spucky117: this game took so long to finish...
[2:13:59] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  Yone can do that and be a hyper carry, but how dare does zed can do only one of those things
[2:14:03] najafan: @nautcholibre I mean she's not wrong
[2:14:07] sillycoomer69: zeka > bdd BASED
[2:14:15] GodlyAlba: will zeka be able to play melee champs for the rest of the split and or playoffs and be less of a feeder than previous zeka

[2:14:52] Mizzzraim: time to call wolf
[2:15:06] Violet_Katt: i will never believe a team with Pyosik and Beryl on it arent blatant frauds @MonteCristo
[2:15:10] QuietLighter: watch the 1st min
[2:15:11] QuietLighter: ofthe space
[2:15:13] BubbaGuamje: But I did bet on them to win against T1 :)
[2:15:14] kosstossa: i love the pain

[2:15:16] Fissiccisst: cristoCAKE
[2:15:21] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  honey dicked is a better term

[2:15:24] GodlyAlba: caedrel was spreading the gospel of how fraud KDF is
[2:15:27] spucky117: did wolf respond to your texts after this

[2:17:06] Violet_Katt: doodSad
[2:17:20] zen__cloud: are you gonna watch the T1 vs NS series?
[2:17:31] Zebrios: This was a decent series IIRC
[2:17:33] nautcholibre: How was the work out yesterday @montecristo
[2:17:33] Shimmerz: wolf has not taught how to hate kt the real way yet, his punishment will be more severe
[2:17:35] Nidsmies: It's so sad because Viper still is trapped in team with Zeka and Deft is in that eternal purgatory with Pyosik and Beryl.
[2:17:35] zoneado: I love me some LPL
[2:17:39] spucky117: t1 happy gaming
[2:17:40] yanya7701: how good is RNG this split? Their roster seemed promising
[2:18:05] pandagrog: @yanya7701 very rough. They dont seem to be close to the top teams dispite the nameplates.

[2:18:12] Zebrios: @yanya7701 Middling
[2:18:22] Mizzzraim: @Nidsmies well deft made the shitty bed he's lying in
[2:18:23] Shimmerz: we shall bruise wolfs body so his mind will learn to be humble
[2:18:42] Zebrios: The KT mental beatings will continue until morale improves.
[2:19:16] spucky117: has anyone risked their childhood... and watch any of the new ATLA show yet?
[2:19:34] yanya7701: oh so they benched LWX?
[2:20:47] osrskuzzy: ????
[2:21:59] Zebrios: I always thought LWX was just a worse Jackeylove
[2:22:12] universal_mvm: he is a big fella
[2:22:14] MoonFall24: I'm really sad I was about to bet +2.5 on the RNG vs TOP game but was too late and the bet closed
[2:22:18] yanya7701: @Zebrios nah his peak was higher than JKL
[2:22:25] Zebrios: @yanya7701 Was it really tho?
[2:22:30] yanya7701: it was
[2:22:30] Zebrios: IDK
[2:22:52] Kodord: i would have thought he was a rell main because she has a horse
[2:22:54] yanya7701: JKL is not as good as people especially in the West make him to be
[2:23:08] gargoyldubs: still better than lwx tho
[2:23:08] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:23:09] Zebrios: I feel like Jackeylove would int like LWX does, but he would actually get kills so it kinda evened out, where LWX just ints and dies trying to kill low health tanks a lot.
[2:23:26] yanya7701: LWX is way past his prime
[2:23:54] yanya7701: hes been playing on a lot of sht rosters after that FPX collapse in 2021
[2:24:04] Zebrios: I really like RNG's draft here.
[2:24:36] Zebrios: Neither draft is bad, but I feel like RNG's has more "safe" zone control.
[2:25:05] yanya7701: so is RNG with LP better than RNG with LWX?
[2:25:28] Zebrios: Color correction.  Somebody messed with the saturation levels.
[2:25:38] liamismyname3: can creme play azir now?
[2:25:51] Zebrios: @yanya7701 I don't think it's a huge difference, honestly.  Maybe a little better long term
[2:25:54] tylerjenkinz: Someone turned the digital vibrance to 110 lol
[2:26:00] fedw4: creampie azir?
[2:26:15] yanya7701: @Zebrios so whos the problem?
[2:26:22] alex_is_shadow: Honestly it looks kinda cool
[2:26:30] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Can you think of a reason that TES would trade that hard at level 1?
[2:26:40] gargoyldubs: Tangyuan and LP
[2:26:45] profound23: Hello, I missed the KT review. I bet on KT to win I think I was part of the problem😭
[2:26:48] gargoyldubs: are the problem
[2:26:49] Zebrios: @yanya7701 I think it's a team cohesion issue.  Split calls, etc
[2:26:58] Warzard908: am i crazy or did they make it sharper too
[2:27:00] Violet_Katt: someone tell the Chinese broadcast to reduce their  colour saturation by half
[2:27:27] casperrrem: holy who was on the contrast slider
[2:27:34] Zebrios: I really don't understand Meiko's thought process there.  Was he just trying to let Jackeylove get some CS?
[2:28:21] A_MericanPelican: insta-filter lpl

[2:28:37] Zebrios: I really don't understand CN teams' bot lane strategies sometimes.
[2:29:36] Zebrios: They're doing "no rush level 6" rules, Monte
[2:29:53] dapreyingmantis: Who is the durex ad for
[2:30:20] offcorser: Did sivir get buffs? Why is she popping up again?
[2:30:22] pandagrog: @dapreyingmantis Lpl midlaners
[2:30:30] Zebrios: Meiko randomly here to fight over grubs
[2:31:05] Zebrios: I don't think Ming needed to flash there tbh
[2:31:08] nautcholibre: Guys how are we feeling about grubs over all ?
[2:31:22] Zebrios: @nautcholibre T1 uses them well, everybody else doesn't.
[2:31:28] vanKaaskop: he did get all the red minions to focus ashe/sivir so the blue minion pushed slightly faster and maybe preventing 3 stack wave clash/dive
[2:31:34] yanya7701: @dapreyingmantis Asian audience for league esports is very different from the West. The West are all nerds who cant get laid, but Asian fans got a lot of cute kpop/anime/popular egirls
[2:31:53] vanKaaskop: + maokai started dorans shield
[2:32:09] nautcholibre: Grubs feel weird in solo Q but when you six stack they rock.
[2:32:23] Zebrios: Grubs are more of a "win more" button.  They force you to trade down if the other team has a pushing lane.  So if the team with grubs overloads a lane, you have to respond before they get to the turret or you're always trading down.
[2:32:54] yanya7701: what did he use E for?
[2:33:20] tylerjenkinz: I thought he might have used it on slam
[2:33:21] RoughRunner98: must have use it on a varus q
[2:33:24] esr_140: who did tes lose to chzt or monte?
[2:33:24] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:33:32] GosuBws: @RoughRunner98 prob this
[2:33:34] offcorser: Mightve used it on a varus q or maokai e?
[2:33:40] GosuBws: it's long cd
[2:33:40] tylerjenkinz: Yeah no, didn't use it
[2:33:45] yanya7701: he just didnt use it
[2:33:57] tylerjenkinz: look at the hud
[2:33:58] Zebrios: Sapling into shield for mana return maybe?
[2:34:21] AntiquusTonitrus_3: do u think Meiko is the best support jackylove has had so far @MonteCristo
[2:34:22] Lopseypop: @Zebrios its a heal now a days
[2:34:27] Warzard908: @Zebrios heal now
[2:34:41] Zebrios: Oh is it?  I haven't played Sivir in like 7 yrs
[2:35:01] Warzard908: @Zebrios they changed it last year or late 22
[2:35:03] Zebrios: I stopped playing when all the harassment claims started coming out
[2:35:03] fedw4: maybe coudnt react on time
[2:35:15] yanya7701: nah
[2:35:19] Zebrios: Meiko's got a case for sure.
[2:35:29] r1zznizz: lemonnation is the goat
[2:35:33] yanya7701: Beryl is best support all time for me
[2:35:43] Zebrios: lemonnation and his notebook.  Never forget.
[2:35:56] Uberblacktorne: i love how midlane matchup is creme vs soup dumpling LUL
[2:36:08] green_candles: xpecial is the best support of all time Kappa
[2:36:12] r1zznizz: @Zebrios wrote it in my notebook so i dont forget
[2:36:14] maxkikken: clueless
[2:36:21] MoonFall24: You can spell shield the ignite?
[2:36:22] Zebrios: Why is an aatrox pushed in by Ksante?  I feel like it's supposed to go in the other direction
[2:36:27] gargoyldubs: Targamas is best supp of all time
[2:36:37] r1zznizz: @Uberblacktorne is that what Tangyuan means?
[2:36:55] GosuBws: Targamas might be in conversation for best support
[2:37:08] Zebrios: LP with huge blunder
[2:37:09] yanya7701: @Uberblacktorne tangyuan is not soup dumpling, but I am not exactly sure what soup dumpling is in American Chinese food. If im correct, I believe its actually Xiaolongbao which means little buns
[2:37:11] Zebrios: taking 2 tower shots
[2:37:18] theancientdreamer: @montecristo maybe riot finally nerfed K’sante
[2:37:24] fedw4: is that a beer
[2:37:26] theancientdreamer: with the new patch
[2:37:27] r1zznizz: @GosuBws very short conversation
[2:37:35] Warzard908: wait xiaolongbao is a player too XD
[2:37:44] Uberblacktorne: @r1zznizz yea, its basically like mochi. sometimes with some kinda filling like beanpaste/ground peanuts. served in a sweet gingery soup. its like a dessert
[2:37:44] yanya7701: @Warzard908 yeah exactly lol
[2:37:46] BubbaGuamje: Thats way better than a beer
[2:37:47] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I think LP fucked up after that forced flash.  They lost lane control and had to back because LP took 2 tower shots.
[2:37:48] gargoyldubs: alcohol tho?
[2:37:52] offcorser: Im cool with ksante being dead for at least a year
[2:38:09] green_candles: black raspberry? thats a nice way to say blackberry
[2:38:37] Uberblacktorne: @yanya7701 oh right. thats actual dumplings with soup in it. tang = soup, yuan = round/ball
[2:38:37] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/

[2:38:49] GosuBws: monte, does nip or ig crack top 10 power rankings now?
[2:39:17] Uberblacktorne: yea, a lot of chinese pros name themselves after food xD
[2:39:25] gargoyldubs: iG has to be frauds right
[2:40:03] GosuBws: xun had a really off series and their draft was terrible ye
[2:40:47] r1zznizz: dry arrow
[2:40:49] dah777: he also juked into it LUL
[2:40:50] RoughRunner98: is he shopping wtf lol
[2:40:52] majesticcchim: im bronze af but pro players should be able to flash those arrows right?
[2:40:57] Warzard908: @yanya7701 looks delicious

[2:42:10] offcorser: @majesticcchim Flash is a very important resource so it is greatly beneficial to just dodge. But of course sometimes they fail to dodge and then they get roasted LUL
[2:42:17] sara15gonzalez: do you think the quality of the LPL as a whole is not as good as last year?
[2:42:18] GosuBws: a special shoutout to jerckysminion and buttpounder420

[2:44:29] Uberblacktorne: @jerckysminion hahah! grats though. thats impressive
[2:44:33] yanya7701: 999
[2:44:38] GosuBws: 369 is that guy
[2:44:54] MoonFall24: Btw monte how far up would you put 369 on the global player rank list
[2:45:16] kitkatbar5: PogBones
[2:45:18] profound23: FAKER
[2:45:18] Aoyos_: He could have gotten out of the chain range if he ran straight any direction, instead he went diagonal
[2:45:19] Warzard908: 999
[2:45:19] majesticcchim: 999
[2:45:21] RoughRunner98: rolled a 9 this game
[2:45:25] GosuBws: so good to see him on carries again
[2:45:25] gargoyldubs: 369 is so clutch
[2:45:32] Kodord: that shit is so cool when its not happening in my game Pog
[2:45:35] Thaiestro: Holy shit
[2:45:36] jerckysminion: what a god 369 is
[2:45:43] tiltedfrog: 369 has the worlds largest Yordpole.
[2:45:46] tyromancy29: knight was the problem
[2:45:48] jerckysminion: this dude mayby old but he is still worlds level
[2:46:26] spucky117: 369 is still great
[2:46:28] yanya7701: I hate so much that 369 went back to TES. He shouldnt be blamed for only losing to the best top in the world
[2:46:29] jerckysminion: what???
[2:46:35] jerckysminion: vs weibo u say?
[2:46:38] sara15gonzalez: yeah you could see he practiced alot Aatrox and Rumble since worlds, he used to play good only in tanks mostly
[2:46:45] GosuBws: @yanya7701 it was his choice. he didn't like jdg atmosphere
[2:46:54] Lopseypop: it seems creme can infact play azir
[2:47:04] yanya7701: @GosuBws I know. But apparently thats also bc he got blamed
[2:47:21] RhinoTheHamster: get over here!
[2:47:25] jerckysminion: alright time to find the vod
[2:47:34] Aoyos_: It's actually incredible Tangyuan managed to find the worst possible pathing out of the chains
[2:47:51] gargoyldubs: top lane is busted
[2:48:06] jerckysminion: that's so broken
[2:48:08] sara15gonzalez: now he looks more "free" or happy if you can say no to much pressure or stress
[2:48:12] Performensch: brittlWave
[2:48:15] carnivalnights: Is the LPL weaker as a whole without TheShy competing in it?
[2:48:22] divine_killjaeden: 369 is so hype but everyone puts bin above him
[2:48:29] gargoyldubs: @carnivalnights LUL
[2:48:36] GosuBws: the shy was dog for the whole year till worlds lol @carnivalnights
[2:48:43] yanya7701: @carnivalnights LPL is weaker but not bc of Theshy bc its not Theshy in 2018/2019
[2:48:44] smellofdog: yo

[2:49:41] divine_killjaeden: everytime i see rng i wish uzi would play one more time
[2:49:45] GosuBws: lpl first few weeks is always scuffed because the best teams arent solidified
[2:49:51] smellofdog: didnt kjnow u were a streamer

[2:51:28] nautcholibre: Thank Lord Bezos for his blessing and gifts of  more @montecristo
[2:51:34] Lopseypop: I remember they did something with korea that nerfed streaming already
[2:51:35] smellofdog: conductor? like driving a fucking train?
[2:51:42] borichorichap: time for streamers to organize
[2:51:43] smellofdog: were you a conductor? @MonteCristo
[2:51:47] tyromancy29: lmao
[2:51:49] ThatLatvianGuy: soon subs from turkey will make you pay them instead
[2:51:56] jerckysminion: their so gonna nerf it into oblivion so we need monte to basically stream 24/7 so he can barely afford korean ramen
[2:52:00] UrbanGeographer: will you ever stream on Kick?
[2:52:03] smellofdog: yes i remember the korean hype train
[2:52:16] Skydanzer: It was a good ride, that train
[2:52:37] gargoyldubs: official broadcast died after monte left, I can only watch costreams now
[2:52:37] jerckysminion: he even had tickets !
[2:52:43] tyromancy29: @MonteCristo when does the dom monte thorin dgon doa clash team play?

[2:53:10] zxwb: @tyromancy29 is there any footage of thoorin playing lol? would love to see that Xd
[2:53:11] GosuBws: no point to steam there unless you get a deal from them
[2:53:12] spucky117: kick uses twitch's back end and servers anyway

[2:55:01] MoonFall24: How good your connection should be to stream in two platforms and use VPN at the same time?
[2:55:05] jerckysminion: don't say that monte the korean police will come hunt u
[2:55:13] StealingYoIPZ: north or south?
[2:55:22] jerckysminion: even in china it's rare it's only a single region

[3:06:24] super_oj: @MonteCristo Bullshit, I've heard peple hold you for ransom by KR Triads and you're offered free BBQ wherver you go. This popularity has made you the most prized western peen in ALL of KR. Correct me if Im wrong and we know im not
[3:06:25] ruiva: Korean bbq gets all the love in the west, but korean soups are s tier.  Pretty easy to cook too

[3:11:39] ruiva: I'll be in korea for a family wedding this summer.  Haven't been there since I was a kid.

[3:16:18] nautcholibre: @jerckysminion when his kids are old enough we can just make them join the game lol
[3:16:25] jerckysminion: true that
[3:16:41] nautcholibre: indoctrination is key
[3:17:13] sinnerslayer34: Meiko is really carrying this team comms, evolving from a jackeylove led team to meiko lead is rly an HUGE upgrade
[3:17:35] nautcholibre: @montecristo do you think no preseason is effecting pros this season ?
[3:18:33] McDumps: @MonteCristo Sir, I am confused and would like you to explain that maokai ult.
[3:19:04] 塵世中的一個迷途小書僮: maybe to set up for neeko
[3:19:24] ThatLatvianGuy: it's not the preseason as much as pro leagues starting when the map is released
[3:20:01] RhinoTheHamster: according to *** 14 champs have not been played in all pro play
[3:20:13] nautcholibre: The map really messed with me for like 3 weeks before I was feeling comfortable again but even now I still get confused

[3:21:14] jerckysminion: monte can multi stask kids he's not a absolute boomer
[3:22:08] golden_ks: hi Monte

[3:22:42] Bladetykon: @MonteCristo but december has important cult buisniss in riot games and we can't miss those
[3:22:45] golden_ks: looking forward to it 👍
[3:22:56] DSc_Venom: While the pro players have a bad experience because of no preseason but isn't the viewer experience better in terms of champion diversity?
[3:23:31] Double_Hitt: @DSc_Venom same champs as last year
[3:23:57] 塵世中的一個迷途小書僮: kalista ulti owning neeko every time lol
[3:24:41] aihiavg: is sundered sky aatrox trash? i only see lethality builds now
[3:24:49] BubbaGuamje: @DSc_Venom id argue there would be less diversity becasue players are incentivised to stick with what they know since they dont know whats good anyway
[3:24:54] nautcholibre: I do these challenges where I play a champ for 100 games was in a KHA one about 50 percent win rate about 50 games in patch hit and my win rate tanked when first patch hit. I stopped

[3:30:14] nautcholibre: I watch 369 and I’m like damn I wanna learn Atroxx and then I play it and feed and go meh, I’ll go back to point click  stun moa
[3:30:29] DSc_Venom: @BubbaGuamje my subjective opinion is that the more time pro teams have to figure things out the more they stick to a few champions. I guess my opinion is pretty skewed because teams are playing the OP-s like TF, Karma, Zac(?) as well as last years champs which probably would've happened anyway even if there was a preseason.

[3:32:00] GosuBws: LP the woolite of LPL
[3:32:16] BubbaGuamje: @DSc_Venom TF and Karma werent a huge pick until they're respective buffs. It wasnt caused by preseason patch. I'd say theres remakably low champion diversity becasue certain picks always serve pro play very well (K'Sante, Azir, Maokai)
[3:32:16] VanidarD: I really dont like this RNG team, they are just sooo bad
[3:32:42] MoonFall24: Wish there were people like you, Dom or any of LFN on dota2, are you planning on expanding to it?

[3:33:32] carnivalnights: I know it's ultra niche, but it would be cool if you guys found a fighting game dude under the LFN banner.
[3:33:49] Thaiestro: Cast for TI?
[3:33:59] smellofdog: honestly dota 2 is so niche imo
[3:34:02] VanidarD: lets go Crime!
[3:34:11] ThatLatvianGuy: is prince going to latam now that he's benched in lpl? montecristo o7
