[2:44:53] riin08: i think its kinda like the standard tier color
[2:44:56] Dezter: press S to choose what skills to unlock their skill trees for too btw
[2:45:11] riin08: blue=uncommon, yellow=rare

[2:48:19] Dezter: yes, press S
[2:48:20] Lawferry: S
[2:48:30] Hydro_Penguin: if grapplr would be thrown into a fantasy world, i'll bet he'll be either a wizard or a rouge.
[2:48:46] ReddishMoon: you can choose one skill for master it
[2:48:50] ReddishMoon: total of 5
[2:48:51] riin08: pick a spell
[2:48:55] chelomm91: ou can only lvl 1 skill at a time then you unlock more spots
[2:48:58] Dezter: you can also respec it in the top right if you want to for free
[2:48:59] Lawferry: Oh is this your first ever playthrough?
[2:49:06] chelomm91: i mean what i wrote is wrong but just 1 for now

[2:49:20] StreamElements: Make sure to join the Discord if you want to stay in touch while the stream is offline!  https://discord.gg/jXRqSyxD4R
[2:49:22] chelomm91: when you cast nova, it will cast any one you enable at random
[2:49:23] ReddishMoon: the spell you master can change into so many cool things
[2:49:25] riin08: u can cast ice?
[2:49:33] Lawferry: It means it changes the spell yes
[2:49:50] Lawferry: Up to you
[2:49:52] chelomm91: no, nova will always cast ice nova if its the only one enable, if you have another element it will cast at random
[2:50:11] Dezter: yes
[2:50:11] Lawferry: You can pick all 3
[2:50:11] chelomm91: yes
[2:50:16] AnjosFate: Go grap, go grap!
[2:50:17] Hydro_Penguin: can you pick other spells?
[2:50:23] chelomm91: each element has the same chance to appear
[2:50:27] chelomm91: but only 1 at a time
[2:50:27] Lawferry: But it will be harder to itemize
[2:50:27] AnjosFate: grappHEART
[2:50:32] DubbieGod: picking all is not efficient
[2:50:32] Noftie: @chelomm91 is saying it will cast one at random if you have more than one
[2:50:49] ChirusHighwind: Time to respec
[2:50:54] Hydro_Penguin: JUST FIREBALL
[2:51:08] Lawferry: Despec

[2:51:16] ChirusHighwind: Despecialize
[2:51:21] ReddishMoon: right one
[2:51:55] riin08: i really like the skill customization in this game
[2:52:02] Hydro_Penguin: i miss jocat with the just fireball meme Sadge
[2:52:16] Noftie: free respec is cool mechanic for new game :)
[2:52:36] Lawferry: Do you prefer chat to shut up or do you like tips?
[2:52:37] thereaperl: @riin08 i dont like if you change a specialization you lose all the progress with previous skill
[2:52:52] Hydro_Penguin: for someone already played this game, can you respec as many times that you can?
[2:52:58] chelomm91: you get it at lvl 9 or something
[2:53:10] DubbieGod: they need to charge 1$ per respect smh
[2:53:11] thereaperl: @Hydro_Penguin yes
[2:53:13] shoat1: can you move move with keyboard or only mouse?
[2:53:37] Noftie: are the health pots diablo 2 style or poe style?
[2:53:40] Hydro_Penguin: that's actually good for me. i usually change my mind on builds LUL
[2:53:57] Noftie: aka pick one up each use
[2:54:13] thereaperl: @Hydro_Penguin i dont remember if you can change subclass
[2:54:39] Hydro_Penguin: not changing subclass is fine for me. as long as you can respec skills
[2:54:53] chelomm91: @thereaperl when i chose my mastery it told me you cant, thats all i know
[2:55:02] Hydro_Penguin: thank you for the info @thereaperl
[2:55:09] thereaperl: @Hydro_Penguin np
[2:55:16] EagleEyesII: you cant change subclass

[2:55:25] Hydro_Penguin: just dodge LUL
[2:56:04] Noftie: SMOrc
[2:56:07] ChirusHighwind: I like how there's just a shrine of money sitting in the middle of this battlefield
[2:56:14] ChirusHighwind: Classic game logic
[2:56:31] thereaperl: @GrappLr  if you skill levels up, it will show a icon where you have the camera
[2:58:00] muchaklimt: new skill
[2:58:03] thereaperl: the new prologue its pretty cool
[2:58:23] Andy_975: MathLr

[2:58:35] muchaklimt: orb around yu i guess
[2:58:39] BlexBoy: it's good
[2:58:47] Rossi_Porto: ward is your main defense
[2:58:48] chelomm91: but dimish over time
[2:58:56] thereaperl: the fireball pretty much its a basic attack, it should be on right click
[2:59:03] colo_rado_: hello grapp, what´s your opinion about de game? im thinking to buy it
[2:59:08] Glebk0: is that some diablo clone?
[2:59:16] Noftie: wow that's strong
[2:59:16] Hydro_Penguin: @colo_rado_ he just started
[2:59:20] Noftie: it reduces damage too
[2:59:39] chelomm91: 5
[2:59:39] BlexBoy: 5
[2:59:42] Hydro_Penguin: no
[2:59:42] Noftie: fine on my end
[2:59:44] ChirusHighwind: Stream seems fine
[2:59:47] BlexBoy: no
[2:59:47] colo_rado_: no
[2:59:52] chelomm91: on the right click you can put another
[3:00:00] EagleEyesII: yeah if the fireball doesnt cost mana, it'd be fine on the right click
[3:00:01] thereaperl: right click you can put another
[3:00:10] Hydro_Penguin: you closed it
[3:00:12] EagleEyesII: im not getting lag

[3:06:48] AnjosFate: grappHEART
[3:07:30] k2llertv: Heeyoo
[3:07:36] Hydro_Penguin: for a bad reason i think?
[3:07:39] Hydro_Penguin: for bandle tale
[3:07:42] Noftie: have you decided on a subclass yet?
[3:07:55] chelomm91: that shield retaliate with fire damage

[3:11:00] Hydro_Penguin: defense*
[3:11:22] AnjosFate: And deffense is the best offense
[3:11:32] AnjosFate: *Defense
[3:11:41] thereaperl: best cc its death
[3:13:11] Hydro_Penguin: i do not mind if you stream this game until expansion hits. not much game that can recommend other than tekken 8 and tft 3.5
[3:13:34] AnjosFate: No, imagine: If you have to take advantage in a duel, who has the best odds of winning? The one attacking or the on defending? TakeNRG

[3:16:02] Snnuy: thats why i play fiddle, he just stands still KEKW
[3:16:30] AnjosFate: In fighting games is not much about the character, in my opinion. It's more about how you play them, so the playstyle
[3:16:57] thereaperl: do you have in mind what subclass are you gonna choose?
[3:17:13] Snnuy: thats fair, i like playing shooters and i play them somewhat frequently i just dont actively try to get better at them

[3:17:31] geno_64: @definitelynottams nah more like jack 8 or maybe king
