[0:36:11] Dzukill: is black cleave rly worth
[0:36:13] SCYTHEMYTHROAT: EXPLAIN THIS PLS : The changes that gave players below Emerald +/- 28 LP per win/loss have resulted in promotions and demotions being too streaky, resulting in an increased frequency of players losing more LP than they gain. With patch 14.4, we'll be reverting back to +/-25 LP per win/loss to make climbing a bit more consistent and reduce instances of players getting into negative LP states.

[2:05:21] FioriSpezzati: @RipleyUp KEKW
[2:05:23] pan_con_chicharr0n: @sdihfu12 but as soon as he lands it the yone ult procs i think, idk
[2:05:28] Niels_The_Kid: why he dont take the antiheal blade ? (donc remember the name)
[2:05:37] Nimlaya: Don't look Chatlog
[2:05:44] szewuuu: why u dont freeze lane
[2:05:45] horrorificreature: @sdihfu12 yeah i meant ww would cancel yone ult since its mid channel i think, unsure how that works tbh, flash is a instant cast while the ult takes like a sec
[2:05:49] pan_con_chicharr0n: @Niels_The_Kid bc ww can Q a minion and go full hp again
[2:05:50] zzzfujin: yone's ult takes too much time for ww's one tbh, timing would be hard af
[2:05:52] korsan8806: false item
[2:05:53] baoketban123: @Niels_The_Kid he lose all in and ww can just heal from minions
[2:05:58] CatinVoIeuseDeCitrons: @voltigeur__ :)
[2:05:58] paul_0208: only 2min cd on barrier? thats not really much i think...is it?
[2:06:00] Nimlaya: firstGarf
[2:06:02] Kontrar: Because anti heal is fake when you give up your main damage source or delay your power spikes
[2:06:05] horrorificreature: @zzzfujin yup, flash is instant, yone ult isnt
[2:06:06] danlicky: @CatinVoIeuseDeCitrons hes banned
[2:06:13] CatinVoIeuseDeCitrons: ah
[2:06:22] wizstars: @Kontrar buy mortal reminder first trust me
[2:06:32] Kontrar: @wizstars sure
[2:06:50] Niels_The_Kid: @pan_con_chicharr0n @baoketban123 yeah but when they trade ww will healed himself less
[2:06:56] Maedros17: What's the point in anti heal if you arent doing any damage?
[2:07:05] mknjn23: @dzukill culling now ?
[2:07:06] RipleyUp: can yone go inside herald when E ?
[2:07:09] elhuatillo: @Maedros17 true
[2:07:15] Yukanahh: oh new build path for term
[2:07:16] horrorificreature: @Kontrar it is worth to get it after laning phase right?
[2:07:19] termaus: yo @Dzukill would terminus bork be good this lane? hes going armor it seems
[2:07:19] imeepyy: cozy do this irl dzu 󠀀
[2:07:21] baoketban123: @Niels_The_Kid when they trade dzu doesnt heal but ww can heal back from half hp to full
[2:07:23] elhuatillo: and ww will get full hp just farming
[2:07:24] DarK_DayZ__: @RipleyUp yes
[2:07:33] Nimlaya: cozy
[2:07:34] nozarashiiiii: hello mr bill
[2:07:34] zzzfujin: @niels_the_kid ww can avoid trades to heal and yone won't have enough dmg in the end
[2:07:44] Niels_The_Kid: ooh I see
[2:07:44] RipleyUp: @DarK_DayZ__ Is E just canceled after this?
[2:07:47] Kontrar: @horrorificreature It is not even worth then because you will easily outscale his healing with your damage
[2:08:00] horrorificreature: thats smart
[2:08:13] raivato: @Niels_The_Kid at some point in the game u out  dps his healing
[2:08:19] justgethigh: All nighter?
[2:08:21] DarK_DayZ__: @RipleyUp you just snap back when u get past your threshold .
[2:08:26] Nimlaya: @justgethigh no
[2:08:37] immeralis97: Terminus gonna be insane this patch
[2:08:38] elhuatillo: @raivato but u need the all in early i think
[2:08:39] Niels_The_Kid: he finally took the antiheal blade
[2:08:45] paul_0208: @Kontrar as perfectly shown here after baron with help from others
[2:08:46] RipleyUp: @DarK_DayZ__ oh, thx 5Head
[2:08:55] zzzfujin: btw the antiheal little item has the same passive than mortal reminder so better to not buy the full item at that point imo
[2:09:18] horrorificreature: @zzzfujin yeah, its the same effect, you can just get the full item later on or even sell it at some point
[2:09:38] raivato: @elhuatillo first item u can try outplay if u can't early
[2:09:38] termaus: bro edging the turret
[2:09:40] baoketban123: @Niels_The_Kid after he had 2 items yeah but dont buy it in laning phase

[2:10:15] Kontrar: Healing and Shielding are just a form of additional health. Buying anti heal early on in lane can help prevent healing but you delay your critical power spikes / core build which are necessary for your champion to function properly
