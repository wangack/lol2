[0:29:59] UnfamiliarToramaru: demeLurk Hi deme idk if you'll see this but i originally encountered you on youtube in your God Of War Ragnarok vods. At first i began watching you cause of your cool looking model but you're actually quite a vibe & i think you're underrated. I hope you reach 1000 subs & also i can't sub atm cause i'm currently broke. Btw are you gonna stream the God Of War Ragnarok dlc?
