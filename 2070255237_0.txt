[0:21:19] Lazynameross: RabbitArrive
[0:21:39] crusaderkami: when you have low ping you can react better so being more aggressive would make sense with a lower ping
[0:21:56] 00001991: 0.1 sec is NOTHING

[1:33:59] thirassy: team is blind, they don't see you got pressure top like 80 % of that game xD
[1:37:17] 291x: turnUP
[1:39:20] 514484: consider cryptbloom instead of void staff, the CDR is nice
[1:40:47] 514484: the heal is a funny gimmick but really the CDR and lower cost is the core
[1:41:02] 514484: against kaenic, understandable monkaS
[1:41:16] 514484: that said, other champions didn't have MR
[1:43:10] 514484: let's see
[1:44:25] Lazynameross: autofilled within 3 min queue??
[1:45:16] Lazynameross: how was it this easy
[1:46:39] Lazynameross: PogBones heim
[1:46:50] 514484: would you go cryptbloom if you faced sqishies? let's say maybe 2 of them built MR but they are still squishies
[1:47:01] Dolwin: streamer guarantee
[1:47:08] Lazynameross: mr pav do you know why heim main build dcap 1st item
[1:47:12] 514484: movement speed, ee... ee.
[1:47:44] seigebrisbane: max W , swifites? rapidfirecannon KEKW
[1:48:50] 514484: i'll test this later today
[1:48:56] Lazynameross: btw you can set up custom search engines in your address bar
[1:48:57] 514484: (not on taimo tho)
[1:49:04] thirassy: saw 46 / point
[1:49:23] Lazynameross: you can have keyword be like "lolwiki" then search magic pen right there
[1:49:51] 514484: agreed, damage is better
[1:49:54] YolkBun: void staff becomes worth as soon as they buy a null magic ipavKEK
[1:50:06] henrymichell2: MYAAA
[1:50:12] 514484: but you know, it's a fun gimmick, we only had voidstaff for years
[1:50:26] CptTeempo: Welcome to non toxic Taimo main Taimo stream cohhBless
[1:50:26] 514484: apparentkly, since the heal scales with AP nicely, it's a fun item on veigar
[1:50:36] thirassy: 10 ap is flat anyway, and if you already got ability haste, you don't gain that much % cdr right ?
[1:50:41] Lazynameross: its gimmick for teeemo cuz hes not intended audience
[1:51:03] Lazynameross: hes a champ with a passive dmgg ability and another being an ms boost
[1:51:34] Lazynameross: haste item not wildly important to him compared to mages with actual casts
[1:51:41] seigebrisbane: TF top? Monkas
[1:51:52] seigebrisbane: oh its itrelia
[1:52:00] 514484: maybe the heal is a win-more ability? if you get a pick and it heals your team, do you need to heal to win the rest of the fight?
[1:52:01] Lazynameross: RABBITDIESFROMCRINGE irelia
[1:52:28] seigebrisbane: @514484 last game how often was he with his team? think about that

[2:09:48] YolkBun: ipavHmm
[2:09:49] qtzzu: ipavSip
[2:09:51] 514484: blinding the stun is always a thing of beauty but only works  if the projectiles travel for about max range
[2:09:59] 514484: short range it doesn't work
[2:10:12] Lazynameross: what was the q qol change they made last patch
[2:10:15] 514484: that's why pav walks away
[2:10:23] 514484: also, that puts him further from danger
[2:10:23] Lazynameross: i thought it would be for stuff like this
[2:11:17] 514484: interesting
[2:11:44] 514484: this is pretty big

[2:13:18] 514484: double tp on the taimo KEKW
[2:13:19] Lazynameross: this double port Smoge
[2:13:36] YolkBun: what if you just press q from a distance then dont touch the keyboard Susge
[2:14:07] 514484: when an enemy tries to stun you, stop moving, this way his stun is wasted :)
[2:14:24] Lazynameross: these were good ults at least
[2:16:53] thirassy: Ipav, can we compare ms diff to clicks vs keybind, or even keybind vs smartcast ? ^^
[2:17:09] 派教授博士先生: dingdi245
[2:17:13] 514484: this is why i mute everybody
[2:17:20] 514484: and sling animal names at them when needed
[2:17:44] 514484: must never read their absurd words otherwise i get permabanned

[2:19:23] YolkBun: everybody knows lvl 5 ivern beats lvl 6 irelia ipavHmm
[2:19:26] 514484: even if he did
[2:19:37] 514484: yep KEKW
[2:19:46] 514484: freezing kills ivern, pushing kills you KEKW
[2:19:51] 514484: solo qq experience
[2:20:04] 514484: you basically have to ping everything hoping they listen otherwise they die KEKW
[2:20:36] YolkBun: mr ipav will you be playing the bandle tale league game
[2:22:22] Lazynameross: speed too
[2:23:21] Lazynameross: ctrl f "-to-"
[2:23:39] justname: Erm
[2:24:48] 514484: yes Q range is from the center
[2:24:53] 514484: and AA rane if from the edge
[2:24:54] Lazynameross: wiki/Range
[2:24:58] 514484: range is*
[2:25:02] Lazynameross: im assuming i cant link here
[2:25:34] 514484: that's why the 680 of the Q is deceptive
