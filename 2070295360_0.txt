[0:30:31] Tristiiano: I like it when they try to steal camps when you still have smite up it’s dumb as

[0:50:17] getsometalentloser: remeber when shaco had real dmg numbers on his skills @santorin ?

[0:50:31] binultwitch: that's just jg tax LUL

[1:03:29] Tristiiano: that’s hard thing I find with shaco so much shit one shots your boxes and ult
[1:04:45] Danishshadow: Maybe this means more Shaco? Pog
[1:04:55] smellofdog: i thought shaco was unbeliably shit
[1:06:09] Deigosanchez99: yoooo
[1:06:18] getsometalentloser: feeding off bad macro
[1:06:26] Deigosanchez99: sorry I’m late just distracted watching @Broxah
[1:06:37] solidussovis: You need to practice your clone fake out. Leave clone back go invis then run at them. When the clone snaps to you they will thing you came out of invis and jump on it
[1:06:53] Deigosanchez99: tyty
[1:06:53] LeHozed: @Deigosanchez99 same lol

[1:13:23] Tristiiano: that Q buff will be super nice I always thought it just felt so slow they out kite it so easily
[1:13:28] DeathWaffle: Do you think it will make him a good jungle tho?
[1:13:32] Floeey_: i play tcg games i hate reading so i need a video

[1:14:29] smellofdog: when does the turkish arc start
[1:14:36] Tristiiano: I guess I’m lcs too I’ve done that millions of times
[1:14:39] PigeonSenti: i can't see any world where a volibear players does that differently
[1:14:45] ntmadeit: ur brain lagged for a second
[1:14:59] worldparadise420: your veigo quadrakill against EG in Baron pit is still being viewed in YT
[1:15:20] ntmadeit: no one can't beat caedrel's malzahar play
[1:15:22] moosE3knucklE: sniff run dont stop.. realize u fucked up.. die
[1:15:32] Floeey_: its called technical play let enemy bot ahead for more gold
[1:16:01] ntmadeit: did you guys win that game tho
[1:16:14] NachoLazer_: Why is it uncommon to leash in high elo?
[1:16:31] PigeonSenti: team gap
[1:16:42] NachoLazer_: Ohh
[1:16:44] NachoLazer_: Gotcha
[1:16:53] Floeey_: shut down gold and objective gold in the jungle + towers seems like a good deal
[1:16:53] ntmadeit: also enemy can understand your pathing as well no ?
[1:17:00] Floeey_: all planned out thats why it was play of the game
[1:17:15] moosE3knucklE: u really dont need a leash as a jungler especially since they added the pets
[1:17:28] tman8er94: Reksai change looks like a straight  nerf from what I can tell
[1:17:34] NachoLazer_: @moosE3knucklE True you just see it all the time in lower elo
[1:17:48] NachoLazer_: Because people dont really think about losing matchups etc. xP
[1:18:00] moosE3knucklE: @NachoLazer_ yeah. they are still learning da wey
[1:18:52] NachoLazer_: @moosE3knucklE Indeed me being in the lower elo i am also learning da wey. Reached my peak tho, P2 !
[1:19:29] moosE3knucklE: @NachoLazer_ hey congrats! thats awesome
[1:19:36] ChicoLoLxD: steelcaps rush xD
[1:19:48] NachoLazer_: @moosE3knucklE Thanks man!
[1:19:58] iyoricthedark: iyoricthedark subscribed with Prime. 
[1:20:20] moosE3knucklE: they did change most of Reksai's abilities to do Magic Damage. so maybe AP Reksai could be strong.
[1:21:09] Teebs0809: Teebs0809 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! lesgo
[1:21:24] lolyanchan: @Santorin how do you play the graves vs kindred matchup as graves i can never win it
[1:21:38] Teebs0809: I'm good! always love being here
[1:22:21] ChicoLoLxD: @moosE3knucklE they changed unburrow to ap instead of ad  and lowered prey seeker ad ratio which is strange
[1:22:28] ntmadeit: no context i just found out that people in cold countries consume more ice cream than hot countries
[1:22:47] moosE3knucklE: @ChicoLoLxD her Q is also Magic damage too
[1:22:58] ChicoLoLxD: yes
[1:23:15] moosE3knucklE: its just the Bite and Ult that are AD now
[1:23:28] ChicoLoLxD: burrowed q isnt used for damage tho
[1:23:30] moosE3knucklE: so maybe a hybrid build or something? idk its kinda odd
[1:23:38] moosE3knucklE: right
[1:24:01] moosE3knucklE: but they also changed unburrowed Q to be an auto attack now too lol
[1:24:03] lolyanchan: i like going a mix of stormrazor rush into full lethality on graves idk if that's troll @Santorin
[1:24:27] ChicoLoLxD: yeah I predict AD is still preferred because E is 100% of total AD which is really strong
[1:24:34] ChicoLoLxD: plus max health damage lord
[1:24:46] ChicoLoLxD: E on reksai seems very strong
[1:25:55] AistisSlayer: ornn on the pecs
[1:26:07] MeowySan: Pog
[1:26:08] ntmadeit: its because in hot countries ice cream is only for summer but cold countries see it as a dessert
[1:26:21] PigeonSenti: @ntmadeit Might be because summers in cold countries are pretty hot and since people are more customed to cold temperature, they get hot faster
[1:26:58] ChicoLoLxD: @lolyanchan I like opportunity / eclipse... it's very cheap and the passives on both items are good on graves
[1:27:02] jzipfel20: I have seen a lot more Illaoi support recently
[1:27:13] RifleEU: Hubris cyclo graves feels really good
[1:27:37] MyqLamb: Would you be willing to queue up Howl by The Streetlight Manifesto?
[1:27:39] lolyanchan: @ChicoLoLxD isnt eclipse nerfed for range?
[1:28:09] ChicoLoLxD: yes but the shield is useful nonetheless
[1:28:14] justcoup: Havent seen Ilaoi support but seeing a lot of Teemo support. Feel i missed something somewhere on this
[1:28:19] Teebs0809: any good advice for solo queueing as a support main? just trying to grind my way into gold for the first time
[1:28:26] ChicoLoLxD: and you proc the shield on pretty much every q
[1:28:27] thee_briefcase: is this buffed volibear patch now?
[1:28:38] GreenBaePackers: What's good Santorin how you doing  today
[1:28:39] PineappleCoco: did riot cook with the voli buffs?
[1:28:42] ChicoLoLxD: @lolyanchan the shield procs on both parts of q
[1:28:56] lolyanchan: @ChicoLoLxD ok ill try it
[1:29:02] Teebs0809: aye GB fan in here @GreenBaePackers
[1:29:14] lolyanchan: @ChicoLoLxD i feel like if u go eclipse with new cleaver as well u will go so fast
[1:29:50] ChicoLoLxD: @lolyanchan opportunity gives u the move speed but that is true... opp/ecl/bc could be the move
[1:30:24] GreenBaePackers: @teebs0809 yesssirr we in here FutureMan
[1:31:00] Teebs0809: @GreenBaePackers letsgo GB for life man
[1:31:46] RifleEU: You play gragas so different than I do, I E  flash so much in ganks
[1:31:51] ChicoLoLxD: holy the turn around went crazy
[1:31:58] krazilec_: wow super clean teamfight holy
[1:32:14] BenJaggers: I can't believe you aced them there
[1:32:33] PigeonSenti: gragas just has big bones
[1:32:41] GreenBaePackers: How's the new patch looking for JG? Any good/bad changes you've noticed? @santorin
[1:33:16] PigeonSenti: very large thorassic cage
[1:33:16] vindice1441: 💀
[1:33:23] getsometalentloser: American bones
[1:33:26] getsometalentloser: 🇺🇸
[1:33:52] Humbleblood: lmao isn’t a thoracic cage… a rib cage lmaoooo what an elaborate way to say it 😂😂
[1:33:53] GreenBaePackers: Says Mr 6 pack LUL LUL
[1:33:57] DeathWaffle: What did they change in jungle?
[1:33:57] lolyanchan: @ChicoLoLxD ghostblade isnt good on graves anymore right?
[1:34:23] lackmind9: mostly voli bear buffs and Reksai changes
[1:34:25] ChicoLoLxD: @lolyanchan no it sucks from my experience playing it its so weak
[1:34:38] KillYourShadows: Don't worry about Yasuo, he's just trying to get the 10 death power-spike
[1:34:45] lolyanchan: @ChicoLoLxD yeah i noticed it too
[1:35:12] ChicoLoLxD: @lolyanchan ppl still build it so maybe i'm playing wrong
[1:35:24] ntmadeit: riot keep nerfing asol im so mad
[1:37:16] Broitone: what you think about reksai changes? make her viable again?
[1:37:22] RifleEU: I think that if you ulted mid E then a she was read
[1:37:30] RifleEU: Dead*
[1:39:15] im_tongan: I fell asleep and didn't get to see all of the Nunu gameplay yesterday
[1:40:14] MeowySan: LUL
[1:40:16] getsometalentloser: reksai next
[1:40:20] ChicoLoLxD: well played :D
[1:40:40] g1oomey: it was an above average bomba, don't be sad KappaRoss
[1:40:57] GreenBaePackers: Liandries zac was so troll lolol
[1:41:40] Broitone: ad break the second he talks about jung changes bigsad
[1:42:56] MeowySan: what item you go first on ap Zac?
[1:43:07] getsometalentloser: rek sai or ap ivern reeee
[1:43:14] lord_reksai: Have you tried reksai changes? @Santorin
[1:43:14] GreenBaePackers: So voli looks better now?
[1:43:23] Santorin: @Broitone Maokai not good jg already - now nerfed even more. Reksai more of a bruiser champ - gonna try her out (movement speed increase - is usually big for champs in general and especially reksai, so might feel very nice=
[1:43:51] PPenjoyer69: what was ur least favorite champ to pick in pro play
[1:43:53] iyoricthedark: AP voli
[1:43:57] iyoricthedark: go full ape
[1:44:06] GreenBaePackers: Sundered sky voli lolll
[1:44:22] g1oomey: meta voli is lika nashors -> riftmaker, weird ass stuff
[1:44:22] Ancarage: i deleted LoL cause my win is too old to play it Clueless
[1:44:27] moosE3knucklE: i love AP Volibear. i have so many games of it Jungle.
[1:44:58] Ancarage: now i can only watch mr streamer to play lol to enjoy it
[1:45:08] MeowySan: awww I love noc :o
[1:45:20] Pandaz8MYDAD: lol thats crazy
[1:45:22] MeowySan: lmao
[1:45:23] lord_reksai: Do you think theres any chance of an ap bruiser reksai build with ad scalings being nerfd and ap scalings being buffed?
[1:45:32] Ancarage: 5/1/2 and still lose Sadge
[1:45:38] lord_reksai: Like lia rift tank or something?
[1:45:41] ntmadeit: @Santorin what do you think of closer as a player
[1:46:47] oreomegalul: happE reksai
[1:47:31] Ancarage: is her new scaling that high?
[1:48:02] getsometalentloser: I miss old macro ultimate reksai
[1:48:13] Ancarage: that looks like a ap ww case
[1:48:15] Ancarage: you can do it
[1:48:22] Ancarage: but probably the normal build is better
[1:48:29] lord_reksai: I think stride bc tank is still core reksai build
[1:48:31] Ancarage: i could be wrong
[1:48:34] Ancarage: Clueless
[1:48:36] Social_Phobia: ive been waiting all day for your stream - hellooo
[1:48:37] getsometalentloser: bruiser is what there trying to push her into
[1:49:13] KillYourShadows: Spin to win POG
[1:49:34] baevermaas: baevermaas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! this is not Warwick?
[1:49:36] Ancarage: They made Q a cancellable enchance auto by the way, because there is a new bug with it if they kept the Q uncancelable with the R, but most of the time you wont notice it since they speed up the Q now
[1:50:20] lackmind9: yes your W got a change from target to all
[1:50:29] R8X2010: you were too far i guess
[1:50:35] getsometalentloser: the knock up is aoe again
[1:50:56] KillYourShadows: Can only knock up every 10 seconds I believe
[1:51:11] baevermaas: you should call me before playing Warwick @santorin
[1:51:11] im_tongan: Hydra?
[1:52:40] YISP: botrk works on first auto now
[1:52:47] baevermaas: Unsubbed
[1:53:34] sebastianminiatures: morning boss o7
[1:53:42] baevermaas: 45 months of asking for Warwick just for you to pie me off like that. I’m leaving UNSUBBED Madge
[1:53:55] annehappy318: @Santorin sunderer good 2nd item
[1:54:04] YISP: @fbphilly yea, the slow now just works from the first auto
[1:55:08] lord_reksai: ngl reksai looking kinda shit now wtf
[1:55:30] ChessBoxinLIVE: do u a click with leftt or right?
[1:55:58] WingedChipmunk: Ya her wind up is REALLY bad. It should not be as long as it is
[1:56:12] KillYourShadows: The Q looks weird and visually weaker? Like before it looked powerful now it looks airy and light; I know that sounds dumb but...
[1:56:53] baevermaas: yeah you should just play WW instead
[1:57:56] PigeonSenti: Trundle's name is literally "The Troll King" in french lol
[1:58:29] WingedChipmunk: I mean you can cancel EVERY one of rivens empowered auto animations and then there is this
[1:58:37] Griefclaw: why did they even change it from a spell
[1:59:25] baevermaas: I don’t think anything is wrong with Rek’Sai I just think you are bad. @santorin
[1:59:36] KillYourShadows: @baevermaas KEKW
[1:59:55] lord_reksai: wtf did they do to reksai
[2:00:02] Social_Phobia: nashors :D
[2:00:09] im_tongan: I thought assassin hydra was the go
[2:00:11] Whitizi: try kraken haha
[2:00:16] lackmind9: You're not an assassin anymore, you're a bruiser
[2:00:32] WingedChipmunk: Lethiality/kraken Rek'sai
[2:00:36] WingedChipmunk: its the only way lol
[2:00:38] lord_reksai: stride  last patch was really good this shit looks terrible
[2:00:39] Whitizi: buiild her like viego
[2:00:42] KillYourShadows: Maybe you build her like Bel now?
[2:00:51] KyleKyleArgyle: is this new rek'sai?
[2:00:54] Princess_Keenny: finally can build runaans
[2:01:03] annehappy318: sunderrer sky
[2:01:31] Ancarage: you say that but there is also udyr into janna Sadge
[2:01:40] ntmadeit: does anybody wear contact lenses here, i wanna ask smth
[2:01:58] im_tongan: Cleaver with new buffs maybe?
[2:02:09] Ancarage: would titanic better if we build a bunch of hp bruiser ad item?
[2:02:13] Whitizi: wait what about terminus
[2:02:13] lord_reksai: idk early game reksai looks terrible like at this point just play sej and call it a day you do more dmg as full tank sej lmao
[2:02:27] Gjerg10: kraken firsti item? xd
[2:02:36] Whitizi: attack speed ad and tanky on terminus for first item pauseChamp
[2:03:13] PigeonSenti: you literally deal no dmg wtf is this
[2:03:16] TheGesterr: monkaSTEER
[2:03:31] moosE3knucklE: idk from what i understand about the changes. they dont want her to be an assassin style champ anymore. bruiser tanky style. so there has to be something to make that work lol
[2:03:31] KyleKyleArgyle: I don't think new rek is supposed to be a big damage dealer right?
[2:03:36] getsometalentloser: so reksai another rell now ?
[2:03:45] PigeonSenti: maybe stridebreaker is still too much of a shit item
[2:03:47] DJ_Photik: So many grubbies
[2:04:12] DeathWaffle: You're dmg is so trash? wtf
[2:04:33] PigeonSenti: maybe you need on hit dmg like bork
[2:04:42] PigeonSenti: but it seems shit
[2:04:49] ntmadeit: jankos went titanic black clever steraks
[2:05:12] Princess_Keenny: maybe this fits with a support jungle meta
[2:05:19] serulric: @santorin  could it be a hail of blades rune and lethality build??
[2:05:22] Princess_Keenny: knock up machines
[2:05:30] YISP: the tunnel cd buff is nuts
[2:06:11] getsometalentloser: how can u go bruiser when ur base dmg is dog shit
[2:06:13] getsometalentloser: lol
[2:06:17] getsometalentloser: riot games
[2:06:18] PigeonSenti: they did a horrible job of it then lol
[2:06:37] pandamixed: How do the reksai changes feel so far
[2:06:42] RifleEU: this akali should be careful not to hit soo many skills
[2:07:01] YISP: the change was to make her feel more modern, lower the damage and increase survivebility
[2:08:02] pandamixed: Is it something that you can get used to or is it just scuffed?
[2:08:08] lord_reksai: nah these reksai changes look fucking terrible watching you play
[2:08:13] sebastianminiatures: TP's in as mini, is that Summit?
[2:08:18] WingedChipmunk: @YISP judging from gameplay, does not look like it was a good change lol
[2:08:30] lord_reksai: Like unironically it looks like the weakest version of reksai I've ever seen why pick this champ rn
[2:08:59] Ancarage: her biggest plus is probably the full AOE knock up added?
[2:09:01] RifleEU: Maybe fulltank?
[2:09:33] Griefclaw: bro reading the patch they changed burrowed q and unburrow from ad to ap??
[2:09:42] Ancarage: before it was main target full knock up and a small shorter knock for champions next to the main target
[2:09:43] TheGodOfCakes: If they want her to be a bruiser / tank again, then they should give her back her old ultimate
[2:09:44] moosE3knucklE: i mean we are judging off of nothing so far. give it a few days for people to experiment and its either gonna be just bad or someone will find the build.
[2:09:45] YISP: @WingedChipmunk it creates a different playstyle, building and playing her like pre changes not feeling the same as post changes seems logical
[2:10:15] tacozzzzkekw: Maybe you're supposed to go conq
[2:10:26] GreenBaePackers: Wtfff Akali!!!! Goat
[2:10:41] pandamixed: yeh probably conq now and maybe rush titanic over stride
[2:10:47] KyleKyleArgyle: I think conq would be good with the attack speed changes?
[2:10:54] tacozzzzkekw: Conq is better
[2:11:11] Ancarage: and i notice her general "up time" is logner, she has a bigger hp pool cause of the briser item and she regenerate so much freaking hp off the passive now
[2:11:16] tacozzzzkekw: Oh he has conq lol
[2:11:24] pandamixed: @tacozzzzkekw oop we're all blind
[2:11:25] pandamixed: xdd
[2:11:27] tacozzzzkekw: Lmao
[2:11:33] tacozzzzkekw: Thought he had the atk speed one
[2:11:54] pandamixed: for real its probably xin build now, titanic sundererr steraks
[2:12:02] FreudvsSkinner: I'm too stupid to understand what the Rek Sai changes imply for her gameplay
[2:12:07] trivela2k: how does reksai feel?
[2:12:15] lord_reksai: I mean I feel like you have to build like the old build just to make reksai viable now like yom/titanic/steraks-maw 3rd
[2:12:15] Griefclaw: they nerfed a completely fine champ lol
[2:12:24] pandamixed: @FreudvsSkinner basically she's hard forced tank or bruiser now
[2:12:35] iyoricthedark: yorick jungle
[2:12:37] iyoricthedark: set the meta
[2:12:40] tacozzzzkekw: Lol
[2:12:41] zocton: Wait what did they change about rek??
[2:12:48] tacozzzzkekw: Yorick is fun
[2:12:51] pandamixed: she has zerrro lethality scaling now, so youmuus is troll
[2:13:00] YISP: all her ad scaling were reduced
[2:13:10] Ancarage: they shifted a whole bunch of stuff
[2:13:13] ftUncleDrew: did he try volibear yet
[2:13:17] Baker076: is it all aa's or when q'ing?
[2:13:20] pandamixed: p sure you just go the xin zhao build now
[2:13:25] GreenBaePackers: Voli not yet
[2:13:36] GreenBaePackers: Voli waiting room Keepo
[2:13:50] zocton: Lol yeah that feels horrible
[2:13:59] zocton: First few clears are probably so clunky
[2:14:14] Griefclaw: no massive nerf to q
[2:14:17] Griefclaw: burrowed
[2:14:19] Ancarage: @Santorin before the auto attack on Q is uncancellable, now Q is cancellable because there was a bug with Q and R when Q is uncancellable
[2:14:26] pandamixed: think it just takes time to get used to
[2:14:33] Ancarage: @Santorin they mentioned they might try to fix it in a later patch
[2:14:35] pandamixed: volibear forece YEP
[2:14:45] pandamixed: or rrerksai and go xin's build
[2:14:47] zocton: Try hail yet with dmg build or just running bruiser conq?
[2:15:00] Ancarage: yea it is probably clunky when u regularly played reksai
[2:15:01] im_tongan: Voli?
[2:15:04] GreenBaePackers: VOLI
[2:15:07] ChicoLoLxD: looks like a volibear angle
[2:15:19] Daeth_Wish: So for me who is new to reksai, it will feel good
[2:15:20] GreenBaePackers: Voli or we RIOT
[2:15:24] Ancarage: maybe titanic hydra would fix the lower dmg issue?
[2:15:26] zocton: Full tank rek angle ever??
[2:15:27] Ancarage: idk
[2:15:28] Gjerg10: viego build in her
[2:15:33] Social_Phobia: kindred
[2:15:33] im_tongan: Full AP voli
[2:15:34] pandamixed: Volibear force YEP
[2:15:34] Ancarage: it is always a Volibear angle
[2:15:37] annehappy318: @Santorin how about pta for reksai
[2:15:52] pandamixed: full movespeed voli YEP
[2:16:02] solidussovis: Have we seen the Wukong jungle yet? Sorry just got back.
[2:16:02] zocton: Yeah I am way to used to the combo it will be hard to get over the habbits
[2:16:10] denryan03: Poppy or wukong ✌️🫰
[2:16:13] BerryXXL: @Santorin are you ever going to frame your jerseys or just hang them?
[2:16:15] lord_reksai: Her dmg just looks way to low and if she's supposed to be a more tanky champ now why not just go sej who does fk tons of dmg? xD
[2:16:47] zocton: Okay here me out... Hydra into full tank
[2:17:01] GreenBaePackers: YESSSS
[2:17:02] ChicoLoLxD: 😍😍😍
[2:17:03] pandamixed: isn't aoe w buff huge for reksai though?
[2:17:09] im_tongan: Leshhhh gooooo
[2:17:17] Daeth_Wish: What are the strongest lvl 2 invade junglers?
[2:17:21] lunariflame: rek q is cancellable, theres a reddit post and phreak youtube video
[2:17:29] solidussovis: Voli patrolling the jungle I like it
[2:17:34] Ancarage: it did
[2:17:36] pandamixed: not on champions
[2:17:41] ftUncleDrew: cookiemanman goes titanic into full tank and it’s pretty good
[2:17:41] lord_reksai: it pushed them to the side then slowed them by 50%
[2:17:43] Ancarage: but the 2ndary target cc is shorter
[2:17:47] pandamixed: it did on monsters but not champions
[2:17:51] Ancarage: now it is the same for all aoe cc target
[2:17:57] I_Am_Chanman: No graves nerf again this patch :(
[2:18:04] Daeth_Wish: xin no?
[2:18:06] zocton: Xin
[2:18:06] Daeth_Wish: j4
[2:18:07] GreenBaePackers: Shaco?
[2:18:19] pandamixed: xin prob better level 3
[2:18:21] lord_reksai: @I_Am_Chanman graves wasn't nerfd??
[2:18:22] bideogamemaui: Brand  atm?
[2:18:23] lord_reksai: ?*
[2:18:29] Ancarage: graves is a lot more manageable now anways
[2:18:56] pandamixed: what do you take level 2 for viego invade w or e
[2:18:57] zocton: Ignite hec invade lmao
[2:19:00] Ancarage: 2 patches ago was pretty scary
[2:19:03] Ancarage: idk what changed though
[2:19:28] Ancarage: how is smolder gonna not die from gold card into hook?
[2:19:31] Ancarage: PepeLaugh
[2:19:38] pandamixed: IGNORE
[2:19:43] zocton: Nashors slaps lol
[2:19:44] Daeth_Wish: I saw this jungle strat that goes raptors to opponent gromp for a lvl 2 invade/kill. Thoughts?
[2:19:45] im_tongan: What is up with ad TF all of a sudden? Everyone I've seen just omegatrolls 😭
[2:19:48] pandamixed: thats for top lane because no one plays jungle voli
[2:20:04] pandamixed: W
[2:20:06] pandamixed: NOooooo
[2:20:11] Social_Phobia: rip xD
[2:20:27] zocton: Nash riftmaker for the content
[2:20:34] GreenBaePackers: Whoa
[2:20:36] pandamixed: jk im boosted
[2:20:49] lackmind9: E shorter CD, R shorter CD but less tower block
[2:20:51] I_Am_Chanman: If ur full clearing its 100 percent 2 points E then 1 q at 4
[2:20:56] Social_Phobia: ok ok ill try voli tonight xD
[2:21:18] pandamixed: they also gave q more move speed
[2:21:27] GreenBaePackers: Do you like old or new voli better
[2:21:39] GreenBaePackers: Le FLIP
[2:22:01] moosE3knucklE: i mean idk if the changes are gonna do anything about that. they just gave more movespeed on Q, 1 second less CD on E, and kinda nerfed R. lol
[2:22:15] zocton: Kekw
[2:22:23] lackmind9: makes fun of the TF gets hooked himsefl
[2:22:38] lackmind9: *smolder
[2:22:41] Tritros: game not looking that good
[2:22:42] zocton: Are shacos ad or ap lately?
[2:22:50] GreenBaePackers: Also smolder needs dorans ring start wtf
[2:22:51] Social_Phobia: @moosE3knucklE but R cd is lowered by 30 seconds.. ^^
[2:23:23] moosE3knucklE: @Social_Phobia yeah. but they cut the time you shut turrets off basically in half. id rather have that for jungle voli lol
[2:23:42] Social_Phobia: @moosE3knucklE ye you're not wrong. i honestly never played the teddy
[2:24:03] coazii: Aww HEEEELLLL NAWWW
[2:24:07] blueknight0007: As a main support i agree that support is weak @Santorin
[2:24:25] bierhell: 15 angle
[2:24:31] pandamixed: yuumi in 2024 xdd
[2:24:39] Ancarage: he walked away
[2:24:44] Ancarage: xdding
[2:24:44] ChicoLoLxD: lowkey baited the hwei there 🥲
[2:25:09] im_tongan: This game is so cursed 😭
[2:25:55] Daeth_Wish: League isn't as snowbally as it used to be
[2:26:00] GreenBaePackers: I hate playing with Yumi and against her smh
[2:26:14] GreenBaePackers: Just terrible champ
[2:26:33] Whitizi: olk but the hwei/voli slam
[2:26:35] Whitizi: is just fantastic
[2:26:43] Gambit2012: thats their top/mid/ad
[2:26:56] pandamixed: oh cc applies after you land from voli r now
[2:27:09] Greatsire23: Greatsire23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:27:12] pandamixed: so if tf stun card during ult youll be stunned after
[2:27:27] TheTrakker: shaco players really be spinning a wheel of all the items to decide their builds xD
[2:27:28] ChicoLoLxD: are u going to build full tank this game
[2:27:35] Daeth_Wish: But because of the bounty system, it makes it easier for lower elo's to comeback but leaves the higher elo relatively the same?
[2:27:46] Whitizi: new badge POGGIES
[2:27:54] Greatsire23: hell yeah mang! Gl on the games today
[2:28:20] GreenBaePackers: Ált f4
[2:28:24] GreenBaePackers: I think works
[2:28:25] Whitizi: turn monitor off 4Head
[2:28:30] Sejstargazin: let's goooooooo
[2:28:31] Sejstargazin: my goat
[2:29:17] Ancarage: lets focus on the positive
[2:29:20] Ancarage: we are playing volibear
[2:29:26] Ancarage: with the siren weewoo skin
[2:29:30] Ancarage: FeelsOkayMan
[2:29:41] Whitizi: FeelsOkayMan
[2:29:43] GreenBaePackers: Love the weeewooo
[2:30:23] DJ_Photik: Is that volibear
[2:30:32] GreenBaePackers: actually boosted
[2:30:33] DJ_Photik: First time chatter
[2:30:34] Sejstargazin: it's one of these games
[2:31:11] Sejstargazin: I had a game like that earlier but I won somehow - but my adc had 0 deaths and was really solid so that's probably why we had a chance
[2:31:54] Whitizi: @Santorin have you tried helldivers?
[2:32:05] Daeth_Wish: Look at the bright side though, even though they are much stronger, you have only lost 1 tower
[2:32:09] Ancarage: weeooo weewoo peepoRun
[2:32:13] pandamixed: how does mandate shaco even work
[2:32:41] GreenBaePackers: They had to cap servers bc too many ppl
[2:32:46] Whitizi: servers are better, still full but thats not necessarily a bad thing. at most you waiting 10 mins at peak
[2:32:59] ChicoLoLxD: 😂😂😂
[2:33:29] GreenBaePackers: BUTTSCRATCHA
[2:33:36] WingedChipmunk: @Whitizi well they finally implemented AFK timeout, should be significantly better
[2:33:39] GreenBaePackers: Get your BUTTSCRATCHA
[2:33:45] Whitizi: GreenBaePackers butt scratcha...?
[2:33:49] Ancarage: @Whitizi i see that as a sign of the game is at least fun enough for ppl to fill the entire server capacity on release
[2:33:58] GreenBaePackers: Family Guy
[2:34:03] Ancarage: surely it is a sign it is a fun game right
[2:34:09] GreenBaePackers: LUL
[2:34:15] Whitizi: Ancarage its genuinely fun. super mindless game but hilarious
[2:34:25] Whitizi: WingedChipmunk ahh is that what happened? i was wondering lol
[2:34:49] Ancarage: @Whitizi yea i saw some of the clips, they know what they are going for with the super propaganda speech and over the top dramatization of drafting PepeLaugh
[2:35:13] Sejstargazin: ok winnable
[2:35:17] joffbozoss: Chance we get a shaco game boss?
[2:35:18] Sejstargazin: I've seen this one before XD
[2:35:42] Whitizi: Ancarage dude its hilarious. all the voice lines are delivered so well.
[2:36:06] GreenBaePackers: Actuallllll supp gap
[2:36:25] solidussovis: Why did they take away the Voli throw for a stun? I like the throw
[2:36:34] GreenBaePackers: Actually tho
[2:36:37] Ancarage: @Whitizi i saw the tutorial part of the game, they just made sure to pamper you with priase on even just moving PepeLaugh its hilariously over the top
[2:37:08] Ancarage: smolder into tf thresh sounds like a pain
[2:37:30] Ancarage: in general
[2:37:46] GreenBaePackers: But nah this was not a fair voli game....
[2:37:51] solidussovis: This game was doomed before you got to krugs
[2:38:14] Social_Phobia: this game looked doomed in champ select O.o
[2:38:19] Daeth_Wish: lvl 9 smolder
[2:38:34] sir_jab: It's probably someone's gf honestly
[2:38:36] WingedChipmunk: @Whitizi ya people were staying logged in overnight so while they were at max server capacity, you had people not playing. So now that it's implemented, it should be doing better rotating players
[2:38:42] solidussovis: I thought Yumi players love hanging on tanks. What is this ones problem?
[2:38:44] joffbozoss: Bro whatever happened to magifelix? Dyk
[2:38:49] moosE3knucklE: its still good lol
[2:38:55] TheTrakker: definetly nerfed, not sure how much of an impact it has
[2:38:57] Social_Phobia: didnt just atk speed growth and ap scaling get nerfed?
[2:39:01] moosE3knucklE: they nerfed someof his AP ratio's
[2:39:37] moosE3knucklE: so AD TF is the same.
[2:40:01] moosE3knucklE: they honestly made it less likely u will see AP TF lol
[2:40:22] twitchMarteX: YEA the tf changes make 0 sense lmao
[2:40:26] ChicoLoLxD: u live??????
[2:40:45] Social_Phobia: maybe they only want ad TF xD
[2:40:52] moosE3knucklE: so yeah the TF "nerfs" are placibo
[2:40:56] WingedChipmunk: how the hell did you survive that!? that was insane
[2:41:10] twitchMarteX: zyra jungle needs to be tried though, if they want her to be a jungler
[2:41:22] coazii: Don't stop believin' Santorin KEKW
[2:41:33] solidussovis: Zyra jungle buff didn't even make her a good jungle
[2:42:23] Ancarage: Since ap ratio was the only other changes on this patch for TF, the only relavent line of text for AD TF is this "Attack Speed Growth: 3% ⇒ 2.5%"
[2:42:29] Ancarage: looks placebo PepeLaugh
[2:42:34] Daeth_Wish: Have you played belveth yet?
[2:43:10] solidussovis: that sums up alot right there
[2:43:12] moosE3knucklE: it just looks like Riot want more AD TF. the nerfs make it so much less likely u will see AP
[2:43:32] ty_flawl3ss: ty_flawl3ss subscribed with Prime.

[2:45:04] Daeth_Wish: I saw a Raptors start and lvl 2 invade at grom right after. Thoughts?
[2:45:10] Social_Phobia: @coazii who doesnt xD
[2:45:23] GreenBaePackers: @moose3knuckle did you use to play Alistar supp and stream?
[2:45:45] Ancarage: @moosE3knucklE the ap ratio nerf was probably because with lichbane, you have like 115+50+50% AP ratio that can happen on 1 auto before on TF PepeLaugh
[2:46:05] moosE3knucklE: @GreenBaePackers nah. i played Shen Top and streamed LMAO def not me u are thinkin of
[2:46:06] Ancarage: idk how they should take TF, but i feel like that was the reason for the ap nerf at least
[2:46:18] solidussovis: lololol
[2:46:27] solidussovis: Santo bringing out the old plays
[2:46:43] moosE3knucklE: @Ancarage yeah prolly but u kno how people are. they see - and no one plays it anymore lol
[2:46:59] Ancarage: yea ad tf is kinda disturbing
[2:47:15] Ancarage: after they gave him pick a card additional crit scaling
[2:47:15] Social_Phobia: honestly games where i try a new champ all 3 lanes lose before i finished my first clear, so i go back to eve and just play from behind xD
[2:47:16] RifleEU: Maybe agurin?

[2:47:28] GreenBaePackers: Deserves a 2nd chance xd
[2:47:34] twitchMarteX: zyra is done fullclearing at 3 mins, losing 0 hp in the jungle now
[2:47:39] solidussovis: Chill jungle Ivern
[2:47:50] TheGesterr: when Seraphine jungle then? luxxBark
[2:47:59] antisuji: I'm glad they banned rengar since you're ivern.

[2:48:33] moosE3knucklE: super clear Zyra now lol
[2:48:36] Ancarage: i thought it was gonna be power neutral with the other nerf tagged on
[2:49:24] darsonia: Hello and good luck!
[2:49:24] antisuji: unfortunately I hope nonsense happens, I never know my clear path when they invade when I'm ivern.
[2:49:37] Ancarage: its ok we stack all 3 support buffs on the unkillable aatrox
[2:49:40] Ancarage: and he can carry us
[2:49:45] Ancarage: PepeLaugh

[2:50:03] Daeth_Wish: I saw a Raptors start and lvl 2 invade at grom right after. Thoughts?

[2:51:05] GreenBaePackers: God I wish you did zac again and just danced on that dirty top lane inter like yesterday @santorin
[2:51:13] GreenBaePackers: But this time the shaco lol
[2:51:46] moosE3knucklE: that person was doing something else lmao
