[0:56:51] Hilzabee: I guess you could put variety stream in the title
[0:56:52] TomNova: i guess if you did a poll or had a schedule on your discord or profile or wherever the best place is. See what works best (if you wanted to try new stuff ofc)
[0:56:55] ajak636: maybe play on weekends cuz lol matches in the weekends sucks anyway

[0:57:50] Darkcyter: @YakePimpson @Hilzabee kaypHello kaypHello
[0:58:02] TomNova: plus its always hard to please everyone anyway so you just gotta do the best you can
[0:58:05] ItsAMoll: league is life
[0:58:16] YakePimpson: @Darkcyter Heyyyyy!
[0:58:22] StTimmy: or split the stream up where half the stream is variety and half of it is league
[0:58:48] ThePeePuddle: You could always do it on an off day occasionally. Don't have any plans that day? Might as well stream random game "X"
[0:59:12] StTimmy: but you do you :)
[0:59:31] StTimmy: I don't want to backseat your twitch career hahahaha :)
[0:59:33] YakePimpson: I have a friend who used to stream apex and started blowing up on tiktok with his apex content. But apex kinda fell off and he switched games and lost a majority of his community and it's been hard for him to grow it back

[1:03:28] jzipfel20: Other games could be a little pallet cleanse after some rough games of league
[1:03:43] TomNova: i feel like there are so many great reasons to watch. Like you're cool, positive, you explain and analyse your plays, you make it easy to learn from and ofc.... you shit on people *cough* :P
[1:04:03] Lazlowe_: I don’t see how a variety day would F up your community. Maybe announce and schedule it, so the league-only crowd doesn’t give up on you?
[1:05:06] mantinio19: Stop I would die!

[1:36:11] arcadedani: after season 5 my love for the game went down
[1:36:11] ForeverLynx_: idk what season but i started playing in 2022
[1:36:15] L0rentzi124: I remember nocturne realse like yesterday, good days man
[1:36:21] jakabolta: i really cant imagine seraphine in the s1 xDd
[1:36:24] Martybggg: I remember when i started playing in season 6 that was exactly when they introduced mastery lvl 6 7 and was around ryze's rework
[1:36:31] YamiCF: I joined around the time of the Volibear rework
[1:36:33] Thewen123: lillia first came season 10 right
[1:36:48] darjar12: have u played the witcher?
[1:37:11] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: panic ult
[1:37:20] 3broooo: shouldn't ur W stop his fly
[1:37:32] L0rentzi124: back then we had to farm points for just making a rune word :D and 50% of all players had dodge chance runes
[1:37:33] rmvfrostbite: yes! @thewen123   just googled it haha so not super long!
[1:37:37] inSINwetrust: Well, it is a black hole...
[1:37:47] CheeseHead1337: I started playing this game when Brand and J4 were brand new. Back when Graves ADC was my main... good times
[1:37:58] speedy9889: I started playing before there were seasons
[1:38:08] champrath: I think Cass W stops Asol's flight
[1:38:11] champrath: if you hit him midflight
[1:38:15] jakabolta: i remember u had runes xD good old days
[1:38:38] Thewen123: the time when you paid for runes
[1:38:40] champrath: I think its unique for him since its a channeling movement
[1:38:46] inSINwetrust: You had to buy the runes
[1:38:46] PeelsNFeels: nah u had to grind so hard for the level 3 runes
[1:38:56] Thewen123: haha
[1:38:57] Saffy1: you had to buy them
[1:38:58] PeelsNFeels: and nobody would take you seriously in ranked unless you had the full sheet for your champ
[1:39:00] speedy9889: You definitely had to pay for runes
[1:39:00] Thewen123: pay to win lmao
[1:39:09] L0rentzi124: yea you bought the runes, mark, seals, glyphs etc
[1:39:13] Martybggg: I miss the old masteries like thunderlords, fervor of battle etc.
[1:39:14] Ro3L: it was payed
[1:39:16] L0rentzi124: armor pen reds was very popular
[1:39:36] ashbringerw3: Hi KP
[1:39:44] champrath: @L0rentzi124 armor pen reds + old mf + BF =  back %80 health Q bounch
[1:39:46] Perseus6: Anyone else having issues getting into game?
[1:39:56] tooclose123: hi kaypea
[1:40:09] PeelsNFeels: Runes were ONLY able to be bought by "IP" influence points, it wasn't RIOT points which you buy with real money. In case people are confused the game was never pay to win.
[1:40:13] L0rentzi124: @champrath ;) dont remind me of atmas into 5 warmogs haha
[1:40:21] jaypee522: the full mage cdr rune page was great
[1:40:31] jakabolta: the old baron and drake tho😂
[1:40:36] svennarrr: the obligatory single crit red
[1:40:50] swizzle22ggwp: there was a 1% crit chance rune and it could change anything in 1v1s
[1:40:54] arcadedani: that time in which my main was Annie mid and she was beautiful annoying <3
[1:40:58] Hymuno: no
[1:41:00] Hymuno: i mean yes
[1:41:01] draz0000: I like that the new runes are more interesting, but they could totally replace the shards with the old megacustomizable pages
[1:41:02] inSINwetrust: Yes rooSuffer
[1:41:03] Martybggg: I think the old rune system was creative and really good, but the fact that you had to pay a shit ton of IP to even make a single rune page, maybe they just had to make them cheaper of ever free like runes are now

[1:41:24] Darkcyter: @ImKuro_ kaypHYPERS WB
[1:41:37] Darkcyter: @inSINwetrust kaypHello
[1:41:41] PeelsNFeels: Yea it was terrible because as you leveled you wanted to use your IP on champs to learn more because you could only play the rotation for free.. so they fucked us by making us buy runes and choose runes or champs
[1:41:41] jaypee522: @Martybggg you just had to play enough and you could have every rune. I dont recall ever buying any
[1:41:41] arcadedani: or those times when you had to build diff runes and items for each adc i dont know i kind of miss that sometimes
[1:42:15] Martybggg: @jaypee522 Yeah but you also had to buy champs which made it even harder to invest into runes and pages
[1:42:29] Martybggg: At least that's how i experienced it
[1:42:33] PeelsNFeels: Ah dude buying pages was fucking awful
[1:42:34] L0rentzi124: yea and twisted treeline old map, and old poppy, old karma, old morde, so many lost memories xD
[1:42:53] jaypee522: it seems much easier to get champions now with leveling up and chests etc
[1:42:54] L0rentzi124: can just hope for LoL classic or something spicy some day
[1:43:05] vergilium: GoldPLZ 2020Wish 2020Wish 2020Wish

[1:53:32] RaynKire: This Aurelion just playing to scale and flipping that his team will win the early game. He's not the reason they are winning at all
[1:53:32] itsAddie34: i take the mana regen spell. clarity i think it is?
[1:53:36] Juhmayzing: i bring it when i adc aram and use it on assassins who solo target
[1:54:04] draz0000: is exhaust in aram bad, or is it one of those mental "unhonorable" things like ranged tops?
[1:54:04] kingprime: I mean im playing a scared little yordle called Heimerdinger in aram xD I dont want to be victim to assassin players

[2:34:09] boisterousninja: ty! another streamer would run ads during game and i'd miss 2 minutes of gameplay and have no clue what happened

[2:35:21] hpy4me: GUYS how can i play veigar jgl ??
[2:35:24] itsAddie34: it's the worst coming in without a sub to your stream, getting pre rolls, and then not getting ads during your ad break
[2:35:36] TheLiin: its not too late!
[2:35:40] Menteroth: boisterousninja, Twitch can force ads. So it's most likely that. Because they don't run ads themselves. That's why most streamers do that when they are not in a match.
[2:35:42] kitty__mel: Good :D
[2:35:46] TheLiin: HAHA
