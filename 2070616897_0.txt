[0:22:14] Fr0stWulf: oh Pog
[0:22:19] Fr0stWulf: i dont like assasin reksai
[0:22:25] crabemporer: removed her true damage stuff for hp percent damage, made her knoch up from underground knock up all enemies in it not just one, increase her hp per level at cost of worse hp regen, and better portal thing speed also better vision while underground i think so she seems also far more stat aligned with a bruiser now
[0:22:27] ProbablyTrist: @LateStar0 All fine, youre welcome~
[0:22:28] PoorMansPoison: Reksai Bruiser my Beloved
[0:22:31] mattband: what the hell. I can watch my favourite stream and also get a free drop for this game. what the hell. :)
