[1:04:55] yassuu3: Take ignite
[1:05:00] ExilST7: Can you share your though about the matchup with us ?
[1:05:01] CosmiN0S: I think the only exception is Irelia, Jesus I find this mathcup impossible
[1:05:01] yassuu3: or exhaust
[1:05:07] filips322: Wait how can I become a mod here
[1:05:13] random67596: Irelia still more interactive and fun than any ranged champion

[1:06:09] Aarguil: frozen heart rush Trolleg
[1:06:17] random67596: @exilst7 skill matchup
[1:06:21] abdullah3rd: Anti heal first?
[1:06:22] archsik: I tried eclipse first item any thoughts
[1:06:30] CosmiN0S: Could you please play with Sea Hunter next time brother? I would appreciate so much glhf btw
[1:06:33] Gladiaeus: Saw potent play vs an aatrox with armor boots and complain that it couldn't die the chat was "broken champ"
[1:06:40] Rotor41: naut mid
[1:06:45] zizoi2: is irelia a toplaner
[1:06:46] ExilST7: @random67596 I used to win it hard, nowadays I find it more like a skill matchup
[1:06:46] xSnaKex1337: eclipse into sundered sky worked for me in dia elo pretty fine vs her
[1:06:52] shigairomiamo: she's got conq instead of LT
[1:06:56] Gladiaeus: seemed like a decent matchup to me
[1:06:57] filips322: I miss goredrinker aatrox. The feeling of q3 flashing into 4 people is divine
[1:06:59] chrono_ward: executioners ?
[1:07:08] swisslion2806: @CosmiN0S he plays fishtrox only against gp
[1:07:11] yannik7567: i know ninja tabi are steel caps but why are they called ninja tabi?
[1:07:15] filips322: Bramble or executioners
[1:07:18] solo_y: oh wow i just noticed nautilus mid
[1:07:30] DarkKnight835: Riot buffed red side is it good ?
[1:07:30] shigairomiamo: it was the previous name
[1:07:32] abdullah3rd: Bork is the most toxic item in the game no joke
[1:07:39] not_sauucy: 3 supports on the team
[1:07:57] Aargul: @Naayil Have you seen the fix with Aatrox's  W? now if they flash at the last moment the W won't pull
[1:08:03] solo_y: you can get armor boots
[1:08:04] swisslion2806: @yannik7567 steel caps were previously named ninja tabi
[1:08:07] solo_y: as a start
[1:08:13] filips322: U got 4 supports on your team
[1:08:17] liro999: you have no damage at all
[1:08:18] mail1000002: !lethality

[1:08:30] yannik7567: @swisslion2806 thx
[1:08:58] DarkKnight835: Nautilus plays tank or AP
[1:09:03] Rotor41: isn't bramble better to go into Irelia. Since its armor + antiheal and exes is just antiheal + dmg
[1:09:10] Rotor41: plus she mostly autos anyway

[1:44:51] youssef334455r: why in lck they play aatrox lethality
[1:45:03] AmirFumetsu: gaysante broken
[1:45:04] YamatoTheKils: @youssef334455r already did and his bot lane died 30 times
[1:45:07] obito552: hes weak now no?
[1:45:09] Gladiaeus: they went too far on his kit
[1:45:10] Aargul: He got nerfed again
[1:45:12] Fear_ultra: they need to rework him
[1:45:16] liro999: @swisslion2806 Ksante just had too much tools, now with the removal of QR slow he will be mor balanced
[1:45:19] Mojamsession: @Naayil what's your favorite aatrox skin
[1:45:28] zorkyie: When i see you play all time cassio top wtf
[1:45:30] mursten1: they should remove Yone too
[1:45:30] grimqz: Melted William Gaming
[1:45:33] lorena_da_glock: what if singed dealt % damage? @Naayil
[1:45:41] CosmiN0S: Same as Zeri lol, at this point just remove them XD
[1:45:42] thedreadfulgamer64: fr whoever made Ksante fucked up real good
[1:45:43] jackal200: Have you tried profane + shurylda ? really good lethality + armor pen
[1:45:45] swisslion2806: @liro999 doesnt matter his design failed because of how many tools he has
[1:45:47] FeltmaN: @lorena_da_glock his E does
[1:45:48] madarauchiha733: hes getting the aatrox treatment soon he will be changed so much hell be a new champ
[1:45:50] eqquilibriuum: @mursten1 100% agree
[1:45:51] ldking: now u cant not full charge w on all out is realy sad
[1:45:53] erdimarru: so whats the nidalee problem?
[1:45:56] swisslion2806: @liro999 the same will probably happen to hwei too
[1:46:00] solemnshadow07: i have a take, riot doesn't understand balance with winrate, you can literally remove lux w e r and buff her q damage so much that she gets a 50% winrate, but they still follow winrate
[1:46:01] Aargul: @CosmiN0S And senna
[1:46:04] lorena_da_glock: @FeltmaN on Q
[1:46:11] adde007_: NEW RUNES?
[1:46:12] swisslion2806: what about illaoi
[1:46:19] FeltmaN: @lorena_da_glock why give him that
[1:46:20] SnorlaxAE: skill?
[1:46:22] jackal200: nidalee is coinflip champ
[1:46:23] bahdek123: hello can someone explain to me why aatrox has the highest pick rate in EUW master+ but a bad winrate?
[1:46:31] Yoshiiyuki: if you dont hit a spear you dont do dmg, no matter how fed you are
[1:46:32] ddandii: for me k'sante use in a offensive way some items that are not designed to be offensive so he will be always broken
[1:46:32] nonnogamer99_: naayil,pantheon rn is unplayble DD:
[1:46:35] kerreal1: Naayil do you know, is red or blue side good in terms of playing aatrox??
[1:46:43] lorena_da_glock: @FeltmaN would that make him superbroken? or it would knda balance him?
[1:46:52] filips322: @naayil do you post on the shorts yt channel? The music is bussin
[1:46:56] solemnshadow07: @bahdek123 maybe people find him fun to play
[1:46:57] madarauchiha733: true Jankos experianced the same
[1:46:58] adde007_: NEW RUNES ON AATROX?
[1:47:05] darthveigar92: Hi bro
[1:47:08] FeltmaN: @lorena_da_glock the problem isnt that he is weak its that his design is outdated and useless in any context of game health
[1:47:08] fan54321: guys is it possible to buy a gaming pc to 600 € mainly for league of legends?
[1:47:08] Gladiaeus: What do you think of Sion game wise ?
[1:47:18] liro999: @swisslion2806 I dont know about that, hwei isnt a tank and when using a tool he was granted he looses 2 for a while
[1:47:27] ldking: shyvana is fine no ?
[1:47:28] bahdek123: @solemnshadow07 that cant be right in high elo right?
[1:47:34] lorena_da_glock: @fan54321 but why exactly? lack of proper gapclose?
[1:47:49] filips322: @naayil do you choose the songs for the yt shorts? I like them very much they are nice
[1:47:49] madarauchiha733: Cassio q e q e
[1:47:51] nonnogamer99_: how u play vs cassio top?
[1:47:57] solemnshadow07: @bahdek123 in high elo and in pro play he is always picked

[2:29:18] archsik: @lorena_da_glock  because people know how to play the game and know his kit which is shit
[2:29:21] solemnshadow07: @Naayil ok here is my take, i think  league has enough champs, that it is time to role lock champions (so u are only offer your role champs on select)
[2:29:58] lorena_da_glock: @solemnshadow07 that is actually a good idea

[2:34:07] archsik: @solemnshadow07  so whats the problem in making a role skillful just as long as we don't have adc 2.0 we are good
[2:34:16] amein16: Those people who can't press accept
[2:34:26] itzt0xic09: solemnshadow07 actually if camps despawn and respawn higher level it would be buff in low elo since they dont farm a camp for 5 mins straight xdd
[2:34:30] archsik: Adc now takes no brain to play and I did abuse them to get inflated then felt shit

[2:37:06] Dx7777: how can nidalee be 55% winrate and still feel like the most useless champ in the game?
[2:37:11] solemnshadow07: @itzt0xic09 imagine this, low elo goes gang fails or die in it goes back finds no camps or get executed by the stronger camps, then just fail a gang again, "bye bye league" that's the reaction
[2:37:19] amein16: Prestige drx
[2:37:25] nuocloc123: @Naayil what do you think of attack speed runes on Aatrox?
[2:37:35] itzt0xic09: @solemnshadow07 i mean its szn 14 camp cant kill you anymore xdd
[2:37:46] bytkier: alacrity is not needed
[2:38:00] bytkier: if thats what u mean
[2:38:17] nuocloc123: I meant the 10% attack speed rune instead of 10 adaptive damage
[2:38:19] Dx7777: unflinching is terrible imo
[2:38:20] solemnshadow07: @itzt0xic09 you haven't seen what i saw XD
[2:38:27] archsik: @solemnshadow07  yea remember back when jg had hard jg champs and not anyone could pick any random shit and go jg people played then
[2:38:31] Dx7777: 2-10 armor is way too low compared to revitalize healing
[2:38:46] itzt0xic09: @solemnshadow07 i have not seen a jg execute on a camp in 4 years bro and im pisslow xd
[2:39:10] solemnshadow07: that's what im saying role lock champion enough with these random shit every patch
[2:39:11] beedsuspect: @Dx7777 have you actually checked how much extra healing you get while ignited?

[2:40:28] Dx7777: @beedsuspect i mean 100 healing is most likely still more than 5 armor gives you in mid game especially when laning vs wukong who doesnt even proc unflinching
[2:40:32] solemnshadow07: just build tear item :)

[4:34:23] saint_delay: on the first split
[4:34:27] Wind_Blade: yes
[4:34:31] Gregoryk_: yes
[4:34:33] archsik: Yea
[4:34:37] Wind_Blade: it's execute if hp is under stack
[4:34:43] angelo_g1: if he's giga fed yes
[4:34:47] Noelletrox: but u need hella stacks for it and its hard
[4:34:50] archsik: Infinity scaling draven
[4:35:01] Wind_Blade: got added on patch V11.18
[4:35:02] Bnadryl: Imagine if aatrox had a stackable something
[4:35:06] manuelink05: kinda like pbe kindred oneshotting the nash before release
[4:35:17] Elrohir_pallanen: V11.18 was the patch
[4:35:19] Elrohir_pallanen: lol
[4:35:26] zu144: @naayil have u seen this aatrox korean OTP kim minjae? Mechanics are insane
[4:35:37] dareee888: My opinion, most broken champs rn are briar and tf
[4:35:38] angelo_g1: isn't like this every time? you log in
[4:35:50] elBoss44: in pro they pick draven and keep stacking then 15-20 later he ults in a fight and cash 1500+ gold from passive
[4:36:02] parox3tine: briar is far from broken
[4:36:12] parox3tine: have u seen vayne or moakai
[4:36:13] archsik: He plays in gold elo clips IDK somone pointed some of the Korean guys for it
[4:36:18] manuelink05: @Bnadryl imagine if he still had his signature pasive
[4:36:20] caelum_7: they have him execute to make him playable in proplay so it rewards big stacking
[4:36:39] theofflinelynx: hit us with the boooooowwowwom
[4:36:50] anilahation: briar is still elo inflated
[4:37:03] Elrohir_pallanen: any advice in the kled matchup? feels hard to do anything but stand back
[4:37:06] Bnadryl: 7:30 in the nighttttttt
[4:37:08] archsik: Exactly
[4:37:14] dareee888: @parox3tine nah but I saw kassa one shooting my whole team

[4:38:04] catador_de_conchass: briar feet only
[4:38:05] Salvussilente_: ah nvm
[4:38:27] Wind_Blade: Briar is not consistant enough to be a good champ, one game you hit the perfect R and you win the game, the other you hit the malphite
[4:38:27] anilahation: do you think ksante is dead after nerfs?
[4:38:33] dareee888: @catador_de_conchass nahhh bro u wont hesitate on that one

[6:44:33] ivi_kun: well, i mean, bruisers jobs is not kill the adc's, is assassins job... but assassins suck this season
[6:44:42] vortekxy: isn't rengar a classic ranged counterpick
[6:44:43] PriestZeus: vi top will be the meta
[6:44:49] MasterCrix: vayne can E in cammile R no?
[6:44:50] wow50000: hear me out, nautilus top
[6:45:10] archsik: rengar top is giga cheese and broken too
[6:45:13] momenv9: jayce is the only champ who can answer vayne kit alittle
[6:45:13] z4m3y: Naayil, I just have to say, you are MY goat
[6:45:19] pan_con_chicharr0n: @MasterCrix Vayne can E camille E if she is fast enough so Camille is ass in lane vs Vayne
[6:45:27] DJWeebo: @Naayil have you tried building Voltaic Cyclosword on Aatrox vs swifties, fast, ranged champions? I use it a lot vs them and it works very well but idk if it works for you in chall, maybe worth a try?
[6:45:40] wow50000: how do i deal with the rengar cheese as mordekaiser ?
[6:45:45] z4m3y: Naayil ignored my comment on calling him the goat, ending myself
[6:45:46] elTotti_: i do
[6:45:51] MasterCrix: @pan_con_chicharr0n thank you

[6:46:53] archsik: free ghost
[6:46:54] pan_con_chicharr0n: xd
[6:46:55] wow50000: predicted lmao
[6:47:12] wow50000: oh i thought that was just a skill issue when they do it but if it happens to challengers
[6:47:12] hotnut10: hey naayil thought on Sunderer + Unending despair + visage?
[6:47:15] DJWeebo: vayne moment
[6:47:25] Hykeir: im kinda inspired to play adc now
[6:47:25] friedreich_ataxiah: !lethality
[6:47:25] Nightbot: you are not zeus, play bruiser or stay low elo
[6:47:37] Hykeir: is range top easier than adc bot lnae
[6:47:44] lorenzi1996: How woukd you nerf ghost then?
[6:47:58] pan_con_chicharr0n: @Hykeir yea bc top gets weaksided a lot
[6:48:06] wow50000: would playing a midlaner top like yasuo work ?
[6:48:08] wow50000: or kayle
[6:48:10] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[6:48:13] wow50000: for scaling
[6:48:18] alooyjacks: nope that would be a huge nerf to adcs
[6:48:25] pan_con_chicharr0n: or reducing % damage while activated
[6:48:26] MasterCrix: yas top really bad
[6:48:29] alooyjacks: be realistic
[6:48:33] MasterCrix: try yone instead if you wanna take one of them top
[6:48:35] DJWeebo: @Naayil if you to try on this acc want I swear on Sundered Sky + Voltaic Cyclosword vs fast champs vallah
[6:48:37] archsik: nerf fleet interaction with it also any champion stacking MS is generally toxic
[6:48:38] Tonocuellarc: what do u think bout the LLA?
[6:48:46] MasterCrix: yas get shit stomped because his kit isnt really good for the average top
[6:49:02] Hykeir: agree
[6:49:03] wow50000: i meant as a counterpick for ranged top
[6:49:20] cullinggameshibuyaarc: teemo top is vayne biggest counter, but yeah good luck picking teemo cuz eventually she scales and gets qss its gg
[6:49:31] sparda99999: that[s true
[6:49:34] skydwellar: !lethality
[6:49:34] Nightbot: you are not zeus, play bruiser or stay low elo
[6:49:38] pan_con_chicharr0n: also fleet shoul not give ms, only hp
[6:49:41] alooyjacks: well meta changes every season
[6:49:41] archsik: you know its busted when a bronze jg gets plat 1 on adc with ghost its not balanced
[6:50:02] cullinggameshibuyaarc: jinx zeri with ghost ResidentSleeper
[6:50:19] wow50000: what if they gave bruisers a way to reduce bonus MS ?
[6:50:28] alooyjacks: but they did buff top
[6:50:30] parox3tine: and because of that heavy cc comps are meta to lock down these stupid adcs which means solo carrying games is almost impossible anyway
[6:50:34] Hykeir: they should bring back ghost ramping up movespeed
[6:50:42] alooyjacks: ah ad twisted fate...
[6:51:00] alooyjacks: well im a jayce main so i dont face much ranged top
[6:51:04] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[6:51:09] douje: they did pick ranged last season but those ranged champions never went the wholesome fleet ghost combo
[6:51:16] wow50000: jayce is kinda ranged
[6:51:27] alooyjacks: yeah
[6:51:33] alooyjacks: but not ghost on him
[6:51:51] alooyjacks: phase rush exac thats it
[6:52:12] wow50000: i forgot sona has a slow
[6:52:14] uuaie: aatrox balanced PepeLaugh
[6:52:34] alooyjacks: a brand not pushing a wave
[6:52:35] sparda99999: probably it´s time to get back the old Stridebreaker
[6:52:36] wow50000: wait if sona slows the enemy wouldnt that be great for you ?
[6:52:36] DJWeebo: @Naayil if you to try on this acc want I swear on Sundered Sky + Voltaic Cyclosword vs fast champs vallah 󠀀
[6:52:37] alooyjacks: thats new
[6:52:41] wow50000: wait sona can make you fast for free
[6:52:46] Hykeir: his brain must've been cooked

[6:53:51] sparda99999: in that fight
[6:53:55] alooyjacks: yeah thats a bad vayne
[6:53:59] alooyjacks: she took alot of poke
[6:53:59] wow50000: so vayne really was as bad as senna
[6:54:09] DJWeebo: @Naayil if you to try on this acc want I swear on Sundered Sky + Voltaic Cyclosword vs fast champs vallah
[6:54:11] cullinggameshibuyaarc: i have been banning vayne almost every game since 2 years now, shit is unreal
[6:54:22] Aatypik: Aatypik subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months!

[6:54:41] alooyjacks: samira is pain now in bot
[6:54:45] wow50000: lmao
[6:54:51] parox3tine: akshan is fine
[6:54:54] parox3tine: askhan doesnt take ghost
[6:55:09] kurolloass: Isnt Senna worts because she has more range?
[6:55:12] wow50000: but arent melee champs meant to be countered by ranged and ranged countered by assasins ?
[6:55:20] pan_con_chicharr0n: brand for sure is master and not elo inflated by that champ
[6:55:20] MrFaby69: he can take it if he wants to go mental
[6:55:23] wow50000: wouldnt the issue be that assasins cant counter ranged ?
[6:55:24] parox3tine: you cant play assassins top lane buddy
[6:55:25] alooyjacks: draven is painful now as well
[6:55:57] wow50000: *bruisers
[6:56:05] alooyjacks: time to zed top xD
[6:56:18] wow50000: oh
[6:56:21] alooyjacks: yup they one shot everything
[6:56:27] ivi_kun: naa, this season assassins are not the big deal
[6:56:44] wow50000: so then why is it senna, vayne, tf instead of assasins everywhere ?
[6:56:50] MrFaby69: a good zed rengar akali can 1v9
[6:56:53] MasterCrix: @ivi_kun they littrely do 40% more damage than last season beacause of the lethality changes
[6:56:55] alooyjacks: have u seen ! talon my guy
[6:57:05] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[6:57:07] tfadiano: bc assassins being strong doesnt exclude adc from being too lol
[6:57:08] Tonocuellarc: @ivi_kun u prob thinking bout zed but k6 rengar and sylas drain hp
[6:57:10] wow50000: oh yeah i hate going against akali top
[6:57:11] alooyjacks: talon / rengar / zed in jg in master +
[6:57:14] DJWeebo: if you to try on this acc want I swear on Sundered Sky + Voltaic Cyclosword vs fast champs vallah 󠀀
[6:57:21] alooyjacks: khazix is ur lucky
[6:57:21] kittyddk: oof
[6:57:28] riplegendery: do u miss goredrinker?
[6:57:34] ricko24: why dont you prefer lethality build
[6:57:47] themorphinl: this season has one of the biggest burst damage in game
[6:57:56] MrFaby69: u need to use e xdd
[6:58:03] kittyddk: sounds good
[6:58:10] MrFaby69: 1 sec
[6:58:10] DJWeebo: very short energize
[6:58:21] DJWeebo: and the slow is strong enough to let you hit the rest of it
[6:58:26] MrFaby69: u use e and u have it
[6:58:28] MasterCrix: autos
[6:58:29] MelzaVII: autos
[6:58:32] wow50000: "ingame"
[6:58:35] DJWeebo: + synergy with sundered sky, and the lethality also increases auto dmg
[6:58:44] MasterCrix: not very ethical
[6:58:48] alooyjacks: u guys have a samira
[6:58:52] koyommi: just give back duskblade Sadge
[6:58:58] DJWeebo: it's not good vs all champs but it's worth a try no?

[6:59:13] MrFaby69: naaayil rylai doable for the ms merchants

[7:06:58] lorenzi1996: But isnt it very tough for every skillchamp too hit these ghost champs
[7:07:07] patitooo_: worst part about ghost is you can use it to kite away then kite back in, it's a lot less punishing than flash
[7:07:54] koyommi: i personally think ghost itself needs a nerf maybe thats to much but the duration and cd is ridiculous
[7:08:08] wow50000: so its the combination of speed and damage
[7:08:11] AsmeowdeuZz: just don't q1e then Kappa
[7:08:30] ruussq: they even buffed her movement speed passive
[7:08:32] wow50000: ban vayne ig
[7:08:38] Fluroop: Vayne is the only champion with no aoe btw
[7:08:39] wow50000: can you play morde ?
[7:08:46] wow50000: i wanna see a good player play morde
[7:08:53] alooyjacks: go yorik man
[7:08:54] AsmeowdeuZz: perfect time to join ranged top lane ig
[7:09:02] alooyjacks: he is broken now
[7:09:14] pan_con_chicharr0n: @koyommi id be fine with 15 seconds if they reduce the damage like 50% when is activated bc it should be used to escape imo
[7:09:20] gennaatrox: it's just sad
[7:09:22] sparda99999: you´re right
[7:09:22] alooyjacks: i know man im in same elo as u
[7:09:26] ThemanaZ: @Naayil i understand 100% what ur saying and im gm level top laner
[7:09:28] darkroasti: we here the ogs
[7:09:38] nuocloc123: Yes Im gold and I definitely understand what youre saying because were both high elo
[7:09:56] wow50000: yeah im also gold and i totally understand
[7:10:00] jp_oliver23: hello darius player here and i say you are totaly right ghost on ranged is just abusive
[7:10:12] jerome_diazzz: @nuocloc123 what
[7:10:30] samuraiakuma: lack of top laner in the balance team?
[7:10:36] ThemanaZ: @Naayil Go to udotgg champ tier list, click top laner at 14.3, look top 5 champs, try not to smile :)
[7:10:37] gibcy: Worts season ever?
[7:10:51] jp_oliver23: darius is just dependante of ghost but if that spell get deleted the game will be bether
[7:10:54] wow50000: whats the difference between salty and angry ?
[7:11:02] Borrachomann: did u see the 2 seconds passive buff?
[7:11:08] 1017marek: salam o7
[7:11:10] ruussq: its not only aatrox , ghost is just too much
[7:11:35] ThemanaZ: @Naayil Go to ugg champ tier list, click top laner tab at 14.3, look top 5 champs, try not to smile :)
[7:11:50] wow50000: so aatrox is garen and mordekaiser tier ?
[7:11:55] pan_con_chicharr0n: they do it on purpose, want to keep adc meta in competitive forever...mf at riot dont care abt soloq
[7:12:16] darkroasti: its kyle but they are alrady lvl 18
[7:12:20] gennaatrox: it's also the flash ghost combination
[7:12:24] ThemanaZ: top 5 champs: 1. twisted fate 2. cassio, 3. urgot, 4. vayne, 5. akshan XDXDXDXDXD
[7:12:32] thatsvigge: How do you suggest this? Like nerf ghost duration?
[7:12:34] darkroasti: the only counter i think is zac
[7:12:55] wow50000: so ranged top, ranged adc, ranged mid, tank supp and tank jgl ?
[7:12:59] ThemanaZ: top 5/5 champs are ranged
[7:13:07] wow50000: would that be a new meta ?
[7:13:07] wwwm3105: ig thats how they balance aatrox?

[7:13:40] nuocloc123: You should talk about this topic in the next podcast
[7:13:53] wow50000: and tank supp ?
[7:13:55] sasgay666: Naayil how about a joke to lighten the mood
[7:13:59] Gakkarii1: @nuocloc123 Trueee
[7:14:10] wow50000: they should turn league into an FPS
[7:14:12] gennaatrox: with serylda they actually have to respect you,without they autopilot basically
[7:14:15] 1017marek: tristana mid KappaHD
[7:14:20] ruussq: they even putted a broken version of stridebreaker and it doesnt do shit
[7:14:33] draco_silence: Theres no gap closing for champs like Aatrox in this season when it  comes to ranged champs
[7:14:37] ruussq: even fiora doesnt go stride btw
[7:14:38] wow50000: would stridebreaker work ?
[7:14:44] wow50000: flash E stridebreaker
[7:14:55] lolckevi: cope
[7:14:57] ruussq: @wow50000 its does nothing ghost is 15 s cd
[7:15:00] cullinggameshibuyaarc: some poeple man
[7:15:05] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[7:15:06] wjzdom: flash in?
[7:15:07] AsmeowdeuZz: @wow50000 u flash they flash gg
[7:15:07] wow50000: oh
[7:15:08] lolckevi: I get it
[7:15:11] gnkkxx: i think slowly everyone needs to wake up and get the problem
[7:15:18] gennaatrox: you can do it every 5 mins
[7:15:19] gennaatrox: ahahah
[7:15:34] enaye321: because you cant utilize your q range since there is not enough cc for you to stick on the range champions
[7:15:36] Gakkarii1: Would iceborn be good into ranged matchups
[7:15:41] capt_grass: ranged adcs should be unreachable if they play perfectly but in the current state theyre allowed to make mistakes and still get away
[7:15:46] Krazichek: rank?
[7:15:46] samuraiakuma: and then trade flash kek
[7:15:50] cullinggameshibuyaarc: everytime when some streamer is explaining shit some silver idiot writes some random shit
[7:15:54] draco_silence: @wow50000 thoseee things have a cool down, ranged auto attackers dont
[7:15:59] Krazichek: !rank
[7:16:00] LoLRankBot: NAAYIL is Challenger  858 LP (Solo/Duo)
[7:16:03] mahies: Riley sceptre
[7:16:03] wow50000: yeah that makes sense
[7:16:03] hakushin: Sadge
[7:16:08] AsmeowdeuZz: I guess just go Rylai
[7:16:21] Krazichek: what lobby id yhid?
[7:16:34] ruussq: stride is 450 aatrox q1 is 625 yes
[7:16:35] wow50000: would ap aatrox actually work ?
[7:16:39] 1017marek: what about ranged champ with slow/cc KappaHD
[7:16:47] wow50000: since rylais is the only consistent ranged slow
[7:16:56] capt_grass: @wow50000 look at his ap ratios rq
[7:16:56] moomangrassfed: seryldas fucking sucks that under 50% health slow has to go
[7:16:57] gnkkxx: build it
[7:16:57] aakashwani_: I will be honest , only way is to get a human jgler so you can get through the early farming . Ghost is important for other champs too so you can't really nerf it
[7:17:00] enaye321: they need to revert seryldas, or at least make the slow a little lower than what it was before
[7:17:00] cullinggameshibuyaarc: try rylais 3rd KEKW
[7:17:01] wwwm3105: lmao
[7:17:02] wow50000: ok maybe not in ranked tho
[7:17:02] gnkkxx: do it one game
[7:17:03] elTotti_: understandable, buff gragas
[7:17:07] jankeseune: hp and slow not bad
[7:17:09] MrFaby69: told u boss rylais
[7:17:10] sparda99999: what about try it
[7:17:15] capt_grass: go build it in low masta
[7:17:15] MrFaby69: try it once
[7:17:16] PriestZeus: frozen malet from the past
[7:17:16] DJWeebo: Rylais try incoming
[7:17:16] mahies: Rilai into rift maker
[7:17:17] wow50000: @capt_grass idk man go nashors tooth
[7:17:18] gibcy: Holy fuck
[7:17:25] moomangrassfed: rylais is actually op
[7:17:28] NEELIXENJOYER: so leude forza ist fertig runtergeladen
[7:17:36] gennaatrox: I mean the fact that they are unreachable it's fine if they have to rely on an enchanter,if they do this alone is just alpha champ against beta
[7:17:41] MrFaby69: just try it once boss
[7:17:42] capt_grass: @wow50000 lethal tempo nashors rylais riftmaker
[7:17:43] PriestZeus: old mallet is the meta
[7:17:46] moomangrassfed: the slow is gross
[7:17:50] enaye321: Pasisive auto XD
[7:17:53] moomangrassfed: wwit
[7:17:54] Alocho: imagine morde's build on aatrox
[7:17:56] xTHExNEAx: I miss old aatrox with AP scaling Sadge
[7:17:56] sparda99999: at least it gives you hp
[7:17:57] PoodleHexd: what about iceborn?
[7:17:59] AsmeowdeuZz: buy lich and you will have one
[7:18:09] gnkkxx: aa
[7:18:11] ruussq: but imagine if they kept movement speed on shojin..
[7:18:12] enaye321: when you auto XD
[7:18:12] PriestZeus: aa
[7:18:14] wow50000: on AA
[7:18:17] gnkkxx: dude u guys dont listen lmao
[7:18:19] wow50000: lmao

[7:18:45] PriestZeus: you need to start vi top lanee
[7:18:48] enaye321: why did they change seryldas like that it makes 0 sense
[7:18:48] gennaatrox: this is a loop
[7:18:51] JohnSnow13666: glacial procs on q
[7:18:54] moomangrassfed: o
[7:18:56] wow50000: theres a slow on exhaust
[7:18:59] wow50000: : )

[7:19:06] 1017marek: hahahagzgzgz
[7:19:08] enaye321: xdddddddd
[7:19:10] ThemanaZ: but like every pick in top lane every champ is situational and works very well vs some comps and bad vs other, otping a champ you will feel both sides no ?
[7:19:11] cullinggameshibuyaarc: ban
[7:19:23] MidEastBeast99: The only slow here is chats brain
[7:19:35] gennaatrox: i'm scared
[7:19:39] ruussq: is conq even that valuable

[7:20:31] gennaatrox: scorch
[7:20:32] gnkkxx: but then u have to play around the rune cooldown
[7:20:34] capt_grass: supptrox top lane
[7:20:35] MrFaby69: still try rylai once boss i bet u will cook it

[7:30:00] thedreadfulgamer64: Vacuum cleaner
[7:30:04] mahies: Honestly, what if they release a game mode with all ranged champ remove, only melee
[7:30:05] wwwm3105: ig a air purifier
[7:30:06] imclawissa: But another House evrytime
[7:30:10] imclawissa: Buy*
[7:30:12] vedzoid: Vacuum cleaner or wipe up dusty surfaces with a cloth
[7:30:16] wow50000: my parents just say vacuum the floor gpt says increase humidity internet says decrease humidity
[7:30:45] akol7: wait they nerfed aatrox?
[7:30:48] vedzoid: But if it's dusty and windy outside, opening windows makes it worse

[7:30:59] AATROXING_BBC: lol
[7:31:23] akol7: what happened? i barely play anymore so dont follow news
[7:31:32] MBales: it’s both right? definitely a huge nerf tho
[7:31:36] nuocloc123: Why didn't they compensate it. They compensated the passive cooldown bug fix
[7:31:36] MrFaby69: that w never fking pulls
[7:31:36] wow50000: its like a filter strapped to a fan
[7:31:38] wow50000: but in a box
[7:31:39] wjzdom: air purifier from dysons would help
[7:31:40] semiu01: they said “might buff people effected by this”
[7:32:04] wjzdom: lmao

[7:32:17] imclawissa: So yeah it pulled?
[7:32:18] chrono_ward: Is the incancellable passive out yet ?
[7:32:21] asso____: outch

[7:32:50] Fluroop: So, now it works properly
[7:32:54] nuocloc123: Why didn't they compensate it. They compensated the passive cooldown bug fix 󠀀
[7:32:58] wow50000: ig its a fix and a nerf
[7:33:02] wwwm3105: man they took the fun momnets from the w
[7:33:21] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[7:33:23] DJWeebo: it works properly now but they literally need to reduce the amount of time to pull because effectively they nerfed it
[7:33:27] therockcena99: That’s more every pull I’m pretty sure so it would apply to Kled and Karma as well for example
[7:33:36] wow50000: why not just make it a feature ?
[7:33:41] BERSERKer_241: @Fluroop but it seedmed funnier before when u pull them after they flash out
[7:33:45] draco_silence: Just change his W to a shielding ability
[7:33:52] moomangrassfed: u might see a compensation buff next patch
[7:33:54] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[7:33:56] moomangrassfed: maybe idk
[7:33:59] WanderingSh0gun: sounds similar to Rek'Sai situation tbh
[7:34:01] DJWeebo: they could have just reduced the time to pull by 0.25s in the same patch to compensate but riot is full of chimps I believe
[7:34:16] Fluroop: @BERSERKer_241 Yeah funny for you, toxic for the one being pulled
[7:34:17] wow50000: make his W change to a shield that increases based off damage dealt and taken ?
[7:34:28] patitooo_: i cant pull anyone irl or in game damn
[7:34:55] wow50000: your goal for finding a gf is just find a girl you vibe with and she vibes with you
