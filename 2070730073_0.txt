[2:04:23] pingkylol: its just bad for mid
[2:04:28] OddVenturer: Keepo

[2:05:21] pingkylol: he presses e and trade is over on his terms
[2:05:31] zafironius: @emotionaladc when will you ever stack it vs gragas if he just q w e and runs
[2:05:51] sharunox: nice e :D
[2:05:56] zafironius: you take it into tanks only and even then the movespeed and slow cleanse is probably better for the rest of enemy team
[2:06:03] gabeow12: completely normal :)
[2:06:13] Croww__: hello everyone
[2:06:18] emotionaladc: i think u can space well enough to stack it but just my opinion @zafironius
[2:06:18] haku62: zeus runs almost exclusively conq only
[2:06:27] haku62: not only vs tanks
[2:06:34] emotionaladc: its for sure better top tho @zafironius
[2:06:35] socratitties00: @pingkylol whats uptime
[2:06:49] ADShooter: zeus runs conqueror top?
[2:06:52] emotionaladc: fully stacked conq @socratitties00
[2:06:54] zafironius: @emotionaladc ok lets say you stack it with ranged w and q then you just not use melee or what? as soon as you melee he es and runs
[2:07:01] haku62: @adshooter yes
[2:07:07] socratitties00: @emotionaladc not much whats up with you
[2:07:09] ltachy: NO WAY HES FINALLY PLAYIN JAYCE
[2:07:11] pingkylol: yes conq is fine top into matchups where u dont need phase rush\
[2:07:20] ltachy: how’s jayce feeling mr. pob
[2:07:28] pingkylol: uptime is like time in combat
[2:07:29] emotionaladc: @socratitties00 ?
[2:07:40] pingkylol: like damage uptime is time spent in fights doing damage
[2:08:01] emotionaladc: @zafironius i mean as u said the trade ends there, so might as well do damage with conq stacks
[2:08:15] zafironius: @pingkylol its the garen effect even in those matchups where its fine phaserush is still probably overall better since you dont really need t he damage and you dont rotate abilities fast enough
[2:08:33] FrappaTheFirst: top lane things
[2:08:34] firmlygraspi1: Mundo doing poorly
[2:08:50] zafironius: @emotionaladc but you dont take conq to just full stack it and leave? thats when you START fighting
