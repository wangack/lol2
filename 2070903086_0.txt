[0:00:21] babaka137: hi
[0:11:30] LucasRulzZ: Saint is really addicted to this game rn xdd
[0:11:32] sartory__: oh I heard this was great is it an rts?
[0:17:29] thehmmmm: the last person I saw play this is oddone. this must be a game for junglers
[0:18:07] KingofZeal: Trade becomes super important as you continue to progress the game.
[0:18:24] KingofZeal: You increase your standing by trading x amount of amber.  Getting the first standing level takes trading 10 amber worth
[0:19:05] KingofZeal: It's basically an investment of sorts.  You first trade routes are going to be kind of crappy, but it pays off big dividends at higher tiers.
[0:19:25] KingofZeal: Not all trade routes are created equally though, sometimes the game throws some awful offers at you that you should ignore
[0:19:44] rayngamingttv: Thoughts on the game?
[0:21:14] rayngamingttv: Why not build warehouses?
[0:21:19] キマロド: i have never played this but the thing at the top right seems to indicate something is going poorly
[0:21:47] rayngamingttv: You know you can reduce hostility by taking woodcutters out?
[0:22:06] rayngamingttv: Hostility accounts for -resolve at higher hostility levels
[0:22:10] KingofZeal: Hostility matters a lot, especially as you play on harder difficulties
[0:22:22] rayngamingttv: No
[0:22:33] rayngamingttv: Top center, under the hostility eye, you'll see an axe
[0:22:34] WontonOneTime: button up top below the hostility eye
[0:23:26] rayngamingttv: Also, hit the open arrow next to your species in the top left and it'll show how to increase their resolve
[0:23:51] KingofZeal: Trade Hub is broken if you know what you're doing, probably not the most beginner friendly
[0:23:53] rayngamingttv: Idle workers become builders
[0:24:55] rayngamingttv: Have you gotten a farm structure yet?
[0:32:08] LimitedEditionsProxic: Good evening SaintV stompaHey
[0:32:56] KingofZeal: Harpies have a lower base resolve.  But they are also the hardest species to keep happy.
[0:37:33] wilsonao: Awww yeah we figure out the strats?
[0:38:31] wilsonao: Pog
[0:38:59] wilsonao: I feel like I am still learning weird stuff about this game five hundred hours in
[0:39:41] KingofZeal: The game has a really high learning curve but it does a good job of giving you time to learn
[0:39:50] wilsonao: Yeah especially as you go up in difficulty levels. Suddenly you can't rely on the OP strat you think you found
[0:40:04] KingofZeal: Admittedly, it's pretty painful watching you play this Saint, haha.
[0:40:13] wilsonao: Yeah if I have to look up a tutorial for a game I am done
[0:40:22] wilsonao: You fine
[0:40:32] ronchohonchoncho: SwiftRage painful
[0:40:35] KingofZeal: Yeah, I know, I ain't hating, I've been there
[0:40:41] wilsonao: It's funny watching all the same stuff I did my first few games lol
[0:41:09] wilsonao: I do that usually but sometimes you don't have enough workers
[0:41:15] robotSabotage: i only ever need 2, but i havent played the super high difficulties
[0:41:39] wilsonao: It honestly isn't that important until you get to higher prestige levels
[0:41:54] KingofZeal: I've seen people go both ways on the woodcutter thing.  I personally like 3 the first year and then I usually just delete one after a while because I don't use it anymore
[0:42:15] wilsonao: The subreddit really focuses on a lot of minmax so uff the doesn't matter until you are like prestige 10+ difficulty
[0:42:57] wilsonao: Yeah I hate wasting pipe materials
[0:43:03] KingofZeal: Pipes need copper or crystal dew
[0:43:24] wilsonao: The ingredients for pipes are the same for tools and I love tools
[0:44:57] KingofZeal: This biome isn't good for farming, you should prioritize camps and it's usually good to try to get to a forbidden glade because they have super 3 star nodes
[0:45:13] KingofZeal: If the game offers you trappers camp, it's super good on this biome
[0:46:26] wilsonao: You've learned to use limits Pog
[0:47:10] splendaa: addicted to this now lol
[0:48:19] wilsonao: Get rid of camps you don't need if you want parts
[0:48:56] KingofZeal: I would strongly consider building a geyser instead of a rain collecter
[0:48:58] KingofZeal: They don't use parts
[0:49:13] KingofZeal: Geysers give you water
[0:49:40] wilsonao: Storm water is rain water.
[0:49:43] KingofZeal: Rainwater includes stormwater, there's three types of water
[0:52:21] KingofZeal: Geysers can also be upgraded to not need people manning them
[0:53:58] wilsonao: Give us back the brickyard game pls
[0:54:29] wilsonao: If your resolve drops too low
[0:55:45] KingofZeal: Wait to see what's in the forbidden glade
[0:55:51] KingofZeal: The camp could be really good
[0:56:12] wilsonao: You will curve out on bricks naturally normally but brickyard is awesome for the other stuff it can make too
[0:56:22] KingofZeal: There's 3 super nodes, one is wheat, one is mushrooms, one is meat.  So if it's the wheat one, take the camp
[0:57:39] KingofZeal: Isn't it in your blueprint pool right now?
[0:58:10] KingofZeal: Oh, you did skip it, rip
[0:58:28] KingofZeal: Yeah
[0:59:05] KingofZeal: You can build multiple camps for those big resources too, they have tons of great secondary resources
[0:59:24] wilsonao: It's good to figure out a non-wood fuel source early to mid game
[1:00:39] wilsonao: Build prio
[1:01:21] KingofZeal: Those caches give you reputation if you use tools on them instead
[1:01:34] WontonOneTime: not the worst... high impatience lowers hostility
[1:02:00] KingofZeal: If you're worried about wood, keep them close to a warehouse so they cut faster
[1:02:18] wilsonao: Yeah you want most stuff near a warehluse
[1:03:25] KingofZeal: With some obscure exceptions, you can only get parts from completing orders and on rare occasion from new villagers.
[1:03:52] KingofZeal: You have the parts, I think, it's the wood you're short on
[1:04:19] wilsonao: Opening glades increases hostility a lot btw
[1:04:39] wilsonao: I will open like 2-3 a game max anymore tbh
[1:04:54] soytarded_kitten: reported for foul language
[1:05:07] KingofZeal: I'd recommend using the wheat for the oil production, your people can eat meat, they can't eat wheat
[1:05:35] wilsonao: Two new ones
[1:08:08] WontonOneTime: you gotta set the oil priority - one dude was making flour
[1:08:47] KingofZeal: Wildfire essence can be used for new hearths and on geyser upgrades, that's about it though.
[1:09:17] KingofZeal: Usually I end up building one extra hearth, some people like to build two
[1:09:42] KingofZeal: A good basic rule of thumb is roughly one hearth for 14-20 people because of how they upgrade
[1:11:53] KingofZeal: Geysers give one of the three water types, rainwater collector collects each type depending on the season.
[1:12:19] KingofZeal: Well, that was because back then, you just needed any water, I ain't baiting you, lol
[1:13:10] KingofZeal: Jerky takes meat and fuel
[1:13:53] KingofZeal: You don't have to complete every order to win, sometimes you just lowroll
[1:18:46] KingofZeal: Star level on buildings just indicates how many resources it takes to make something.  1 star is still better than 0 star
[1:19:52] Bull3472: what is the main goal of this game never played it
[1:20:04] KingofZeal: You need a firekeeper for those houses wo work at that second hearth btw
[1:20:32] Bull3472: so like speed run civilization
[1:21:32] KingofZeal: @Bull3472 It's a roguelite city builder, so you basically build up a quick settlement, make the queen happy and then move on to the next settlement
[1:22:14] KingofZeal: Also, you can never have enough oil saint.  You can use oil on trade packs
[1:22:22] Bull3472: ah gotcha thanks @kingofzeal
[1:22:50] HardlineBlackSwan: Winners queue bois
[1:28:17] KingofZeal: Camps can be huge win cons, you should be waiting to see your first dangerous glade and then take the best one based on the resources in it
[1:30:22] KingofZeal: Another thing people typically do is wait to open their first dangerous glade at the start of year 2 because then you can use the first trader to solve the event
[1:38:43] soytarded_kitten: see ya later, time to die, DARSH
[1:38:48] wilsonao: This why you may want to just open one glade at a time lol
[1:38:55] soytarded_kitten: BOOOM XD
[1:39:13] KingofZeal: There's no stone on this map
[1:39:20] KingofZeal: Forest map only has clay
[1:39:37] wilsonao: Those roots will have some clay
[1:39:49] KingofZeal: Yeah, this is a little low roll, usually you find some sort of clay
[1:40:00] wilsonao: Check caches
[1:40:06] KingofZeal: Usually you can use traders to get by
[1:40:31] wilsonao: Oh yeah lol you used all your stone
[1:41:41] wilsonao: Check the roots node
[1:42:05] wilsonao: You can get clay as a secondary thing from roots I think
[1:42:40] wilsonao: Oh nm
[1:42:50] KingofZeal: You can see what the threats are on the events if you fail them, I wasn't paying attention to what killed you though
[1:45:04] wilsonao: You got a trappers camp harvesting meat right?
[1:45:15] KingofZeal: You can call another trader in a pinch at the cost of queen's patience, but the first one is only half a point
[1:45:26] wilsonao: Prob just need more warehouses near where you harvest
[1:46:00] wilsonao: Warehouse op
[1:47:59] wilsonao: Eh could be worsd
[1:48:07] wilsonao: You only have 60
[1:49:31] misterferrari: during clearance
[1:49:36] misterferrari: it depends the time of year
[1:49:56] KingofZeal: Those objectives actually ask you to use the water.  Each building uses a different type of water
[1:50:56] misterferrari: is everything a hike from your hearth?
[1:51:11] wilsonao: You don't have to do every objective to win. It's fine
[1:51:31] wilsonao: Just make your faces happy and you'll get a bunch of resolve reputation
[1:51:42] wilsonao: Races not faces
[1:52:14] wilsonao: See all those little icons next to each race avatar? That's the stuff they want
[1:52:14] misterferrari: what difficulty we on?
[1:53:11] KingofZeal: I think he said he's on pioneer
[1:53:16] wilsonao: We got an addiction to opening glades EZ
[1:53:38] wilsonao: I open two to three a game
[1:53:42] wilsonao: Usually
[1:53:48] misterferrari: WHAT
[1:53:49] KingofZeal: On your difficulty, you can get away with going crazy with opening glades, but as the difficulty scales, it becomes punishing to open lots of glades
[1:54:12] Fuzzylogic927: I open them when I have tools so I can auto complete a lot of the bad shit in them
[1:54:14] wilsonao: Yeah it's not so bad to do at lower difficulties
[1:54:19] wilsonao: Plus it's fun
[1:54:34] KingofZeal: You shouldn't be opening new glades though when you still have unsolved dangerous events
[1:54:44] misterferrari: how do you have enough resources with only a couple glades?
[1:55:00] misterferrari: mostly re food
[1:55:37] wilsonao: Trade and using the stuff you have available efficiently
[1:56:02] misterferrari: i do be ignoring trade..
[1:56:47] wilsonao: Yeah I did too for a long time. Trade gets to be OP if you can get packs of provisions flowing
[1:56:53] KingofZeal: @misterferrari Trade is OP once you get the hang of it.  It's a super important part of the game
[1:57:12] misterferrari: trade routes? the traders that come by? or both
[1:57:17] KingofZeal: Both
[1:57:20] misterferrari: i'm better at traders than trade routes
[1:57:25] disquared: !gamble 100
[1:57:25] StreamElements: disquared won 100 Saints in roulette and now has 1281 Saints! FeelsGoodMan
[1:57:35] KingofZeal: Trade routes give you the amber you need to give to traders
[1:57:35] wilsonao: Saint you should rob the trader
[1:58:00] wilsonao: Like you will lose cause it gives you impatience. But it feels right.
[1:58:48] wilsonao: Do you have packs of provisions?
[1:59:01] wilsonao: Can't trade without them
[2:00:10] wilsonao: KEKW
[2:00:17] Fuzzylogic927: looking like an 8th
[2:00:29] misterferrari: i had no idea, can you put warehouses wherever in relation to a hearth?
[2:00:36] wilsonao: Ya
[2:00:45] misterferrari: goddamn... ive been playing this game so wrong
[2:00:50] wilsonao: Should basically put them next to any farm
[2:01:10] wilsonao: And any glade you are getting stuff in
[2:01:20] misterferrari: yeah i've been just making a second hearth and clustering around that.. but i couldve been putting warehouses
[2:01:31] wilsonao: Lol yeah so much to figure out and learn in this game. That's why it's fun
[2:01:40] misterferrari: it is a great game
[2:02:04] KingofZeal: @misterferrari You should pretty much setup a warehouse in any dangerous glade you open.  It's important to reduce the distance your units have to walk
[2:02:44] KingofZeal: I guess an easier way to put it is just have one setup where your people are most active
[2:03:11] wilsonao: If you can figure out how to make tools, they are basically a cheat code in early difficulties
[2:03:36] micspam: What prestige are we on?
[2:04:01] KingofZeal: Prestige 20 Kappa
[2:04:03] wilsonao: P25
[2:04:15] wilsonao: We unlocked N extra level
[2:04:24] KingofZeal: Saint is beyond prestige, he's challenger
[2:04:50] micspam: Ok nvm seeing that answers is
[2:04:54] micspam: answers it*
[2:05:01] wilsonao: Lol
[2:06:18] wilsonao: You should be getting a ton of grain from small farms
[2:06:40] wilsonao: You are placing your farms in the wrong spots though
[2:06:45] micspam: yeah ok DEFINITELY know where we're at lmfao
[2:06:53] wilsonao: They are barely covering any fields
[2:07:10] wilsonao: Farms have a small coverage area
[2:08:02] micspam: @wilsonao have you played Dotage yet?
[2:08:06] wilsonao: You need to place farms carefully so they cover all the field spaces
[2:08:38] wilsonao: No, is it good?
[2:09:14] wilsonao: You want to put a warehouse next to each farm
[2:09:27] wilsonao: Or else they don't have enough time to harvest in clearance season
[2:10:01] KingofZeal: You should be using humans in farms, they harvest crops better
[2:10:23] jofu_the_tofu: favor your beavers
[2:10:51] jofu_the_tofu: impatience goes up when people leave
[2:11:51] wilsonao: We can unlock blueprint for
[2:12:00] whiteseal45: make amber and spam blueprint rerolls
[2:12:05] wilsonao: We should get something that gives flour too
[2:12:44] soytarded_kitten: i think you've lost 30-40% of your production because you aren't building your industry near your warehouse. your housing needs to be behind the hearth and not blocking the warehouse/industry
[2:12:53] Zedaine112: this game look equally addicting and confusing
[2:13:19] KingofZeal: @Zedaine112 I probably sunk in like, a hundred hours before I felt like i even remotely knew what I was doing.  Addicting though, very.
[2:13:36] micspam: @wilsonao I went to dotAGE after I got burned out by ATS. Tutorialization sucks but MAN is it actually crack
[2:13:56] wilsonao: Sweat
[2:14:08] Zedaine112: sweat? gross Kappa
[2:14:35] KingofZeal: you can sell a lot of your spare wood
[2:14:48] KingofZeal: You also have a lot of fiber and leather
[2:15:41] wilsonao: Keep packs of crops on grain only
[2:15:46] micspam: @wilsonao Its turned based. Which sounds cringe at first but then you realize thats how you play ATS already lmao
[2:15:50] wilsonao: You should make a ton of it
[2:16:11] wilsonao: Yeah AtS is either paused or at 3x for me lol
[2:17:00] wilsonao: Beanery could give you porridge if you don't tear it down
[2:17:14] wilsonao: Since you are gonna have so much grain
[2:17:35] KingofZeal: Porrige is the easiest complex food to make, you just need rainwater and wheat
[2:17:37] wilsonao: Click on the .magnifying glass to see
[2:18:39] wilsonao: Normally you won't be able to win without getting some reputation from resolve. Complex food is good for that
[2:18:48] wilsonao: Stop cutting wood
[2:18:54] micspam: Do we know to unassign woodcutters yet
[2:18:54] wilsonao: Pause
[2:19:02] wilsonao: KEKW
[2:19:34] KingofZeal: I think all those glades are catching up to his hostility LUL
[2:21:01] wilsonao: Let's do a /prediction
[2:21:17] drevas: smiteLaugh
[2:21:21] micspam: seeing all the empty grass is killing me
[2:22:28] micspam: Yeah farming is turbo broken until higher difficulties, and then its just regular broken
[2:22:59] wilsonao: Have enough tools to open caches yet?
[2:23:16] wilsonao: Open caches and win
[2:23:27] wilsonao: They give reputation
[2:23:45] wilsonao: You have enough
[2:23:57] wilsonao: I see three big ones
[2:25:24] wilsonao: Yes it will
[2:25:32] KingofZeal: Saint I highly recommend you pause
[2:25:36] KingofZeal: And sacrifice fuel
[2:25:45] KingofZeal: Cause you'rea bout to lose
[2:25:52] KingofZeal: Sacrifice wood lowers hostility
[2:26:06] wilsonao: Do we have dudes opening all the caches?
[2:26:18] KingofZeal: Okay, I think you're good now
[2:26:42] wilsonao: You did it!
[2:26:45] KingofZeal: You cut that dangerously close LUL
[2:26:55] wiggles77: that was close
[2:27:06] wilsonao: I love how every settlement ends in a burning mess in this game
[2:27:29] wilsonao: Like no game ends where you are like "this wasn't all about to explode"
[2:27:58] disquared: !gamble 100
[2:27:58] StreamElements: disquared won 100 Saints in roulette and now has 1391 Saints! FeelsGoodMan
[2:28:22] wilsonao: I am glad there wasn't a prediction, I would have lost
[2:28:58] KingofZeal: Yeah, as long as it's next to the seal, you're good
[2:29:03] wilsonao: Yeah if we have enough things to open it
[2:29:05] Eldiloft: Ooh I got here right in time haha
[2:29:36] wilsonao: You are like 95% gonna lose this your first time probably
[2:29:43] wilsonao: Yeah good call
[2:29:58] FarreLit0: yoo sup saint
[2:30:02] wilsonao: KEKW I did that too
[2:30:13] splendaa: this game is awesome
[2:30:46] wilsonao: On these zi usually open a glade to see what direction thesesl is and then B line for it
[2:31:06] Eldiloft: Agreed
[2:31:49] Draczyl: is neighborhood unlocked yet?
[2:31:51] buit724: Nothing useful here so you can delay your options til you get your blueprints
[2:32:36] KingofZeal: Good luck Saint, I gotta head to bed so I can be functional tomorrow, see ya
[2:33:04] wilsonao: I would strongly recommend setting wood utters to only chop down marked trees in this
[2:33:17] wilsonao: Hostility goes insane otherwise
[2:33:43] misterferrari: i definitely agree and i suck
[2:33:46] buit724: Yeah you get hostility per tree cut on seal map
[2:34:15] Eldiloft: Yeah but you still need wood, so it get's scary :P
[2:34:19] wilsonao: There's trees with like 20 charges
[2:34:25] wilsonao: You want to chop those
[2:34:31] wilsonao: The big trees
[2:34:46] misterferrari: i've never thought of that.. more resources but only penalty for 1
[2:34:51] bauless: bauless subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:35:02] wilsonao: Buildings like tavern you pick end game
[2:35:35] Draczyl: You should also probably build a park to upgrade your town hall for 2 resolve
[2:36:45] buit724: If you have unlocked small warehouse, you can build it next to your woodcutter camp to speed up wood production
[2:36:46] wilsonao: I have never built a big shelter ever tbh
[2:37:46] wilsonao: Yeah but they basically triple or more the speed everything around them goes at because of travel time
[2:38:03] Shrapnel__: you got that CLG championship money GlitchCat
[2:38:12] wilsonao: I love ranch
[2:38:25] wilsonao: The farm is good too if there's stable land
[2:38:26] soytarded_kitten: ranch is great if you have lizards + plantation
[2:38:35] wilsonao: Turns reeds and grain into meat
[2:39:00] buit724: You can't after it has been built but you can demolish it and build again since it gives back full res
[2:39:12] wilsonao: Yeah cause you don't have a warehouse up there
[2:39:32] wilsonao: So the woodcutters spend all their time walking to the main warehouse
[2:40:16] buit724: Yeah
[2:40:17] wilsonao: Ya
[2:40:23] wilsonao: All water is rainwater
[2:40:31] Bharadrahmakh: ye
[2:40:40] misterferrari: i think it blows
[2:40:45] Bharadrahmakh: oh no the timer
[2:40:52] Bharadrahmakh: you have cave marrow?
[2:41:01] misterferrari: 20 charge tree
[2:41:04] buit724: That's the big tree KEKW
[2:41:12] wilsonao: The trees they are cutting have like 20 charges instead of 2
[2:41:16] misterferrari: lmao those big red ones are strong
[2:41:20] wilsonao: Ya
[2:41:38] misterferrari: this is the first time ive ever been better than saint at a game
[2:41:50] wilsonao: You want to cut through the 20 charge ones
[2:42:05] buit724: You can press left shift/control to select smaller area to cut trees from
[2:42:27] wilsonao: Foresters but amazing for tools
[2:43:33] wilsonao: No not reslly
[2:43:53] wilsonao: You have so much stuff to work on with what you've opened already
[2:44:18] Bharadrahmakh: its worth buying an upgrade in your geyser pump
[2:44:25] Bharadrahmakh: if you can afford
[2:44:56] buit724: You have 3 2* berries so you can get herbalist for those
[2:45:55] buit724: You have trapper for insects already so it doesn't matter much
[2:46:20] wilsonao: You use mine for that
[2:47:00] Bharadrahmakh: one of those three
[2:47:20] wilsonao: Yeah I always run there wood utters on this
[2:47:48] wilsonao: My phone refuses to let me write woodcutters
[2:47:52] buit724: You can collect reeds and make fabric to build small warehouse since your wood cutters are walking a lot to carry wood back
[2:48:05] wilsonao: It's fine if you only hit the 20 node trees
[2:48:17] buit724: Or buy from trader
[2:49:07] buit724: I think you picked blueprint but haven't build one yet
[2:49:36] Eldiloft: You need to cancel on the event, you didn't select water that you have a supply for :P
[2:49:40] Bharadrahmakh: the UI will tell you if you build one one the build menu
[2:50:57] Eldiloft: Do you have enough supplies to do the other option?
[2:52:42] soytarded_kitten: lmao
[2:52:54] Eldiloft: No
[2:52:54] soytarded_kitten: where would you equip it
[2:53:04] soytarded_kitten: nice lil cock sock
[2:53:05] Eldiloft: Family gratitude is very bad for u
[2:53:41] Bharadrahmakh: you need to do only one of the three win cons, then it will present another choice I believe
[2:56:12] Eldiloft: You want the hearth next to a lot of stuff
[2:59:10] buit724: Your hostility is still 0 so no need to sacrifice wood
[2:59:20] wilsonao: Why we saccing wood?
[2:59:48] buit724: Only if your hostility is high and being your resolve to negative
[2:59:48] wilsonao: Only need to do it when people are pissed off
[3:00:38] wilsonao: Trade X gold worth of goods in the trading screen thing with specific towns
[3:00:44] wilsonao: To increase standing
[3:01:23] wilsonao: You can trade anything not just packs
[3:01:24] Eldiloft: Resolve is your people's happiness, if the green bar that represents there number in the top left reaches the blue tick, they passively generate you reputation points (your blue bar win con)
[3:01:53] Eldiloft: Or you can get reputation points by completing events. That's what that seal objective is meaning
[3:02:27] wilsonao: You can make a lot of wine from all the berrys n shit you have there
[3:02:36] soytarded_kitten: you just gotta give in to the scams sometimes
[3:02:42] wilsonao: You can trade more than 1x on this stuff
[3:03:19] wilsonao: Its a pathway to trading or to increasing resolve
[3:03:39] wilsonao: Not different from most stuff but I saw a lot of berry nodes
[3:04:05] wilsonao: Nah you didn't take the blueprint
[3:04:09] wilsonao: It's k tho
[3:04:09] buit724: He has 2* berry nodes but no herbalist I think
[3:04:51] buit724: Yeah that will bring your hostility back to 0
[3:04:53] Eldiloft: Yes it's quite good
[3:04:56] wilsonao: The hostility decrease is amazing
[3:06:22] wilsonao: You will have to buy from a trader
[3:06:32] wilsonao: Probably
[3:08:07] wilsonao: Not here
[3:08:10] wilsonao: Don't do it
[3:08:20] wilsonao: You get hostility form trees remember
[3:08:37] wilsonao: Copper bars is good
[3:08:41] wilsonao: With the mine
[3:08:43] Eldiloft: Bakery is quite good
[3:09:05] wilsonao: Yeah bakery too but need to make flour for that
[3:09:06] buit724: You can save the tablet for last part of the seal
[3:09:22] wilsonao: Whale music Pog
[3:09:45] Ryance: LUL
[3:09:51] wilsonao: Feel the whale call
[3:09:56] buit724: If you produce enough packs, you can practically buy out trader
[3:11:28] wilsonao: You can do the get resolve through events thing by opening caches for rep
[3:14:20] buit724: Once you get to 14 reps, further rep will not decrease impatience so you will need to pay attention to time
[3:14:44] buit724: It's still lvl 1 for 2 towns
[3:14:46] Eldiloft: The blue bars on the left
[3:14:49] Eldiloft: are the standing lvel
[3:14:51] buit724: You need 2 towns with lvl 2
[3:14:59] wilsonao: You could have gotten it there
[3:15:16] wilsonao: That doesn't matter
[3:15:26] wilsonao: The trading doens thave anything to do with hearths
[3:15:49] wilsonao: You can find it but it's rare
[3:15:51] buit724: I think you have enough caches for event rep so you don't need trade standing
[3:16:09] wilsonao: You almost have the trade standing anywah
[3:16:12] Eldiloft: Trading, events, caches, etc. Those are the ways to get wildfire essemce
[3:16:24] Eldiloft: Technically cornerstones can give it to u as well
[3:17:12] Eldiloft: I'd say u should, especially since you have so many unemployed workers
[3:17:17] wilsonao: No you need two at two
[3:17:21] Eldiloft: but you don't have to
[3:17:25] wilsonao: Trade with traders rest
[3:17:41] wilsonao: You only need to trade like eight more amber or so with them
[3:18:38] Eldiloft: If you click on one woodcutter, you can scroll between them on the woodcutter ui. Same with all buildings
[3:19:14] wilsonao: you have to trade with traders rest
[3:19:21] wilsonao: You keep trading with the first city
[3:19:35] buit724: That just gives you more trade routes, doesn't increase your standing I believe
[3:19:58] wilsonao: Traders rest
[3:20:06] wilsonao: Yes
[3:20:21] wilsonao: It goes up when the route finishes
[3:20:22] Eldiloft: it hasn't completed yet
[3:20:43] soytarded_kitten: tier 1 = traded 10 gold with city. tier 2 = traded 20 more gold with city (30 total)
[3:21:21] wilsonao: ERBS is pretty good pepeHands
[3:21:50] Ryance: DinoDance
[3:22:55] Eldiloft: You got this!
[3:23:03] soytarded_kitten: just start building stuff for t3 and t4 seal
[3:23:21] soytarded_kitten: i forget at your difficulty
[3:23:31] wilsonao: Probably resolve stuff
[3:23:57] soytarded_kitten: 3rd is pay money or send tools/pipes, 4th is the resolve one or send tablets and do 2 forbidden glaves
[3:24:00] buit724: You can save forbidden glaves and tablets for t3 I think
[3:24:09] buit724: Oh t4 then
[3:24:29] buit724: Yeah 120/300s or something like that
[3:24:38] wilsonao: I think we spent like 100 amber clicking on the loud signs for no reason on the trade screen
[3:24:45] wilsonao: Plus signs
[3:24:48] Eldiloft: yup
[3:24:51] Eldiloft: always do
[3:25:33] wilsonao: I think you are fine though Saint. We have trade engine going.
[3:26:22] wilsonao: B
[3:27:09] wilsonao: Oh we have rain mill? Pump out the flour
[3:27:42] wilsonao: It's a W. Just yolo it
[3:28:37] Eldiloft: they are earning you infinite money, enough to buy out the trader completely soon lol
[3:29:11] soytarded_kitten: forbidden are the wolf icons
[3:29:35] soytarded_kitten: ah is later difficulty is forbidden only, lucky XD
[3:30:17] wilsonao: So many people lol
[3:30:45] wilsonao: D
[3:30:53] wilsonao: Might need tools for glades you opening
[3:31:00] wilsonao: I wouldn't open caches now
[3:32:19] wilsonao: K it's easy win EZ
[3:32:50] buit724: EZ
[3:32:59] wilsonao: Never doubted
[3:33:19] soytarded_kitten: ez
[3:33:20] buit724: Yo u have to reforge the seal to unlock next seal
[3:33:35] wilsonao: You gotta get to p20 for it to. E Joever
[3:33:53] buit724: Next seal EZ
[3:33:53] soytarded_kitten: you have 5 more seals to do lol
[3:33:57] wilsonao: No, you gotta end the cycle
[3:34:04] DrZogs: x on upper right
[3:34:05] soytarded_kitten: you just completed the first tutorial bro
[3:34:09] Lowilru: Click the little X at the top. UI misleading
[3:34:13] wilsonao: X in top right
[3:34:22] soytarded_kitten: end cycle
[3:34:29] DrZogs: yes
[3:34:34] wilsonao: Ya cycle always ends after seal attempt
[3:34:55] buit724: Silver seal next EZ
[3:34:56] wilsonao: We beat the tutorial Pog
[3:35:08] soytarded_kitten: 6 iirc
[3:35:12] xculedhel: Easy is the new hard.
[3:35:21] soytarded_kitten: p20 is the last tutorial
[3:35:33] soytarded_kitten: lol
[3:35:33] buit724: P20 has like 20 negative modifiers
[3:35:40] buit724: And 3x hostility
[3:35:49] wilsonao: Each prestige level adds a modifier to make the game more difficult
[3:38:02] wilsonao: Correct
[3:38:12] ronchohonchoncho: I love backdooring you
[3:38:34] wilsonao: That wasn't very satisfying though because nmthere wasn't that one guy malding over every decision
[3:38:50] wilsonao: YOU IDIOT WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[3:39:00] wilsonao: That's like magic the gathering style

[9:49:02] Scruffian: Bedge me knowing asol will be nerfed like illaoi before Easter
[9:49:23] delavor1: wasnt asol pretty balanced until they changed him to get stacks on minions
[9:50:23] Scruffian: ye it turns out being able to stack on minions is a whole lot different compared to stacking from champs
[9:51:05] Kaviji: punching bag
[9:52:02] TheZim: it´s back to old reksai late game utility -> flash W and die LUL

[9:56:38] Kaviji: you are a one trick knock up bot KEKW
[9:57:33] Kaviji: maybe the deal is to just snowball your team with ganks
[9:57:41] Kaviji: so you dont matter later
[9:58:28] Scruffian: not enough burst to pick champs, not enough tank to survive team fights when you go in. Having to rely on team to pop off makes me feel like a roaming support Sadge
[9:59:54] DARKMAMBA20: can you play scaling support this game
[10:00:04] DARKMAMBA20: can you play Caitlyn or Varys support
