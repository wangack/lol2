[4:49:14] The_Jester141: Lol 🤣
[4:49:23] friendlycrackdealer: doesn't it also matter to keep using the IP so yuo don't lose it ? i heard that  was a thing
[4:49:34] friendlycrackdealer: or was that just sony's spiderman
[4:49:35] mrdavido: Vayne top WutFace WutFace WutFace
[4:49:37] friendlycrackdealer: idk
[4:49:50] PlaginDL: They all AD, pick tanky top they said
[4:50:08] Sephirant22: VAYNE!!!
[4:50:24] Hooded_Stranger_: You do need to use the IP to keep the rights, its why Shazam and Captain Marval (iirc) exist
[4:50:35] Amybam: @friendlycrackdealer that only matters with copyright running out after 90 or so years or in terms of contracts like Spider-Men
[4:50:41] Oswin53: thats a mega camp
[4:50:43] rocksandbeer: oh no Aware
[4:50:46] Misterpoody: doesn't matter, viego probably shit
[4:50:53] Hooded_Stranger_: @friendlycrackdealer Sony liscenses out their rights to spiderman tho so I'm not sure it applies
[4:50:55] gosulkk: surely its an island in the toplane Clueless
[4:51:01] Amybam: yeah that’s copyright
[4:51:05] underpressurree: i think its the same with ppho
[4:51:07] Apocolyspecloud: yea thats why sony lost Spiderman
[4:51:09] underpressurree: phone numbers
[4:51:12] shedfitness: yeah they can take it if its not used
[4:51:23] Amybam: Sony didn’t lose spiderman
[4:51:26] Hooded_Stranger_: @Apocolyspecloud Sony didn't lose spiderman?
[4:51:32] Amybam: they just license it back to marvel
[4:51:39] Hooded_Stranger_: They liscence him out to Disney for big Mouse bucks
[4:51:49] acekillem: i think sony owns spiderman and hulk still right?
[4:51:56] friendlycrackdealer: they will never get my hentai. Madge
[4:52:03] Amybam: universal owns hulk solo rights
[4:52:14] ImBoredAndHungry: It can't be taken, the rights just go back up to be purchased.
[4:52:15] Amybam: marvel can use him without license in groups
[4:52:15] mrdavido: Wings used to be a garen gigachad. Now he is vayne top beta BibleThump
[4:52:29] friendlycrackdealer: idk this copyright stuff kinda confusing ngl
[4:52:29] Nasacrim: He def doesnt care, he wasnt mad when they made a movie about a dog with his name
[4:52:34] Hooded_Stranger_: So iirc, Captain Marval existed for a really long time, but Marval hadn't made a comic of him for 50 years or some shit, so DC made Shazam, who was a carbon copy and they won the rights
[4:52:41] Hooded_Stranger_: I may have that backwards tho

[4:52:50] shedfitness: you have to file a trademark for the industry & the product, and keep submitting proof that the thing that you filed trademark for is being used in some sort of sales
[4:52:57] wulfricin: do you think top side AD TF will get popular in pro play?
[4:53:13] Oswin53: why is darius using a redtrinket?
[4:53:20] friendlycrackdealer: @shedfitness interesting
[4:53:55] Hooded_Stranger_: The reason for trademark is to incentivise people to make stuff. You make good thing, get trade mark, get rich off it
[4:53:57] Misterpoody: man, not being able to tank armor or mr runes hurts lane matchups like this much
[4:53:59] Hooded_Stranger_: If you make something
[4:54:01] Amybam: @hooded_stranger_ it’s because DC sued Marvel because Cpt. Marvel was too similar to Superman so they had to stop publishing
[4:54:09] Hooded_Stranger_: and then do nothing with it, people can use it
[4:54:11] shedfitness: the proof is sales tax you pay on the product itself
[4:54:18] 6x5x1x18: Pretty Sure they do, but thats like automatic for them at this point
[4:54:19] aevra14: DC>Marvel
[4:54:20] wulfricin: dont confuse patent and trademarks
[4:54:29] Hooded_Stranger_: So that people can innovate and make derivitave things that imporove on what you made
[4:54:33] shedfitness: but to legitimatize the proof you have to bear the burden of sales
[4:54:38] shedfitness: patents follow a same process
[4:54:49] shedfitness: burden of proof for sales*
[4:54:51] Fractal13rain: trademark are renewed every year are they not ?
[4:54:56] Hooded_Stranger_: Sorry yes i am thinking of patents
[4:54:57] igiveyoudispear: what good is a coke patent if there are 50 other colas just like it?
