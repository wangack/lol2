[0:26:34] Balldropper: this soraka be healing the lads real good <3
[0:26:54] ThomasTheTwink: @bladetrinity16 i believe he just respawns after passive ends
[0:27:01] bladetrinity16: so it doesnt cancel r?
[0:27:14] Velraptured: iirc it was .5% as growth and w and e ap ratios got a minor hit.. so basically nothing to ad tf

[0:42:26] leagueofsuppo: i love milio
[0:42:43] bladetrinity16: i lsot my team the whole game the moment i queue'd up
[0:42:49] ThomasTheTwink: maokai unplayable i fear

[0:43:49] Vaaarangian: Ez supp not popping off
[0:43:58] denunciator: I wonder the extent to which lulus wr is not trading hard enough at lvl 1
[0:44:03] ThomasTheTwink: see stunt hwei is like 90% winrate
[0:44:13] bladetrinity16: id recommend most champs over yuumi
[0:44:15] ThomasTheTwink: so clearly stunt lulu is gonna be like 99999% winrate
[0:44:30] trowaman: Isn't any hard to play champ like lulu going to have a low wr?
[0:44:32] ThomasTheTwink: didnt they nerf her armor too
[0:44:40] Simvicc: im playing a lot of Milio
[0:44:49] frequentlydumb: LUL
[0:44:51] Balldropper: lulu harder to play than hwei
[0:44:52] ThomasTheTwink: lulu is the second hardest enchanter ok
[0:44:56] bladetrinity16: lulu is all timing
[0:44:59] oliveing: time to start showing off my lulu mechanics
[0:45:02] trowaman: Yes your comparing maok wr to lulu
[0:45:12] bladetrinity16: her floor is low
[0:45:33] denunciator: maybe it's just skill gap because buffs do nothing if you don't hit both Q bolts
[0:45:34] Simvicc: Yuumi harder than Maokai confirmed
[0:45:35] Telperion16: I've never seen a lulu 1 v 5 fights so, that means she's hard to play
[0:45:37] BaneBladeV: @stunt they tried to adjust karma away from solo lanes. now mid karma 53 and support karma 48
[0:45:53] trowaman: Wouldn't that 9% wr diff just be skill diff then?
[0:46:00] one2tagg: nidolee

[3:40:00] xbiitezzqt: can i see a hwei support game?
[3:40:07] Voltage_Lol: Susge
[3:40:09] Apostolique: That's why you need to be a bit toxic in chat. Gives you better match making
[3:40:13] ThomasTheTwink: he doesnt read all of chat cuz sometiems they say silly things ok
[3:40:17] Apostolique: Not enough that your allies tilt
[3:40:24] Apostolique: But enough that it swings the system
[3:40:44] ThomasTheTwink: BEHAVIOR DATA
[3:40:45] galentine_: that sounds more like DOTA's thing where they banish all the toxic players together
[3:40:46] cloudydaisies: teaa
[3:40:50] ThomasTheTwink: LOSER'S QUEUE
[3:40:58] RiftJockel: yo whats up

[3:41:08] jannablowsu: oh yeah for sure
[3:41:10] mariseae: didnt they admit smurf queue exists? couldnt that be it?
[3:41:24] jannablowsu: when i start yapping in game i get way more toxic teammates in subsequent games
[3:41:25] atomiccdonut: what was the name of the account that posted that link
[3:41:40] CrazeyeOuO: lol
[3:41:43] khyger: where's my unskilled report?
[3:41:44] Velraptured: I've done extensive testing on fresh and old accounts, losers q 100% exists and it's not just getting reported that puts you there
[3:41:57] Velraptured: Reporting a bunch and the reports not getting verified will also put you in losers queue
[3:42:01] ThomasTheTwink: not the voice
[3:42:12] RiftJockel: What does the golden icon next to champs and skins mean? Is it like that creators get them for free on their accounts?
[3:42:16] mariseae: interesting idea
[3:42:27] Apostolique: It's a REPOST
[3:42:27] CrazeyeOuO: @RiftJockel league partnership program

[3:42:55] ThomasTheTwink: SPAM SORAKA Learning
[3:42:55] jjennukka: @deku_dreaming haii stuntLove
[3:42:57] jannablowsu: @stunt the wild thing is me and my friend had a conspiracy about getting bad teammates after getting reported bc of the tip they have where it says you are more likely to win if you arent toxic or whatever their   wording is
[3:42:58] RiftJockel: wow thats crazy
[3:43:06] blessje: what about maokai?
[3:43:11] Balldropper: wait am I just in time for the signature camille?
[3:43:20] atomiccdonut: soraka twitch really better than lulu?
[3:43:21] Velraptured: The funny part with riot denying losers q exists is the only alternative is their matchmaking is just that bad lol
[3:43:34] jannablowsu: anywhere you would pick maokai pick maokai YEP
[3:43:38] RiftJockel: i think there is no losers q
[3:43:45] ThomasTheTwink: lulu vayne wtf

[7:55:32] ZoeGirl: mao has guaranteed point and click cc, good at diving, ulti really good at catching people
[7:55:53] dragonlilys: the fact that maokai also has a ward ervery 11 seconds is op

[7:56:33] thebubinatoor: I still cannot really play him, only "good" with mage supports somehow, should probably start playing engage sups too now to get out of D
[7:56:57] dragonlilys: just start learning leona for engage supps
[7:57:17] thebubinatoor: @dragonlilys isn't maokai much easier, better now?
[7:57:26] thebubinatoor: with leona you cannot do anything if your team comp doesn't fit
[7:57:58] dragonlilys: i men are you building ap mao or tank? if tnak you also do nothing for your team, if ap you also die really fast XD
[7:58:17] dragonlilys: leo and mao have similar cc, all of leos is point and click tho
[7:58:41] voidmoons: is it?
[7:58:55] ZoeGirl: I would say to learn rakan cause hes engage thats not too punishing if you mess up
[7:59:04] thebubinatoor: rakan is a good shout yeah
[7:59:10] dragonlilys: rakan has so much escape yea

[8:20:38] softlysupports: briar peepoWow
[8:20:42] avuloseunda: Can you cleans suppress?
[8:20:47] Lazynameross: no
[8:20:48] Cariyla: no
[8:20:51] Cariyla: only QSS
[8:20:56] avuloseunda: Learning ok
[8:21:09] softlysupports: i tink u can cleanse it
[8:21:14] maelstromvo: wait can u tell kesseler khan said hi
[8:21:15] softlysupports: if u spam ur summoner really hard
[8:21:17] NicVilll: collector to one shot that Sam is always fun
[8:21:21] maelstromvo: idk if he'll remember me
[8:21:25] avuloseunda: Can rengar meow or gangplank vitamin C to remove suppress
[8:21:32] softlysupports: meow
[8:21:33] Cariyla: Yes
[8:21:39] Balldropper: chat can also meow
[8:21:45] denunciator: meow
[8:21:48] Lazynameross: and our boy stuntVibe
[8:21:50] Balldropper: <3
[8:21:51] Cariyla: I was getting at that because those are also cleanses but the summoner spell Cleanse can't cleanse certain things other cleanses can
[8:21:51] avuloseunda: Ooh
[8:21:53] Cariyla: It's dumb
[8:22:04] MajorrTomm_: what happens after he wins the last Z one
[8:22:10] softlysupports: rencar modCheck
[8:22:17] denunciator: she did not briar hard enough
[8:22:25] Lazynameross: thats more frustrations with naming
[8:22:25] Deku_Dreaming: @Cariyla yeah i agree that the inconsistency is pretty whack
[8:22:35] denunciator: i wonder if asol or vi wins lategame
[8:22:41] Lazynameross: like ss cleanse gets rid of exhaust effect
[8:22:44] soverysour: Hello VoHiYo
[8:22:52] avuloseunda: @soverysour ALOO peepoHey hiiii
[8:22:53] Deku_Dreaming: I also still think it's kinda silly that knockups can't be cleansed or reduced by tenacity whatsoever
[8:22:54] softlysupports: so a magic spell is less powerful than a meow and 🍊
[8:23:01] Lazynameross: so its still having a special place
[8:23:01] Balldropper: can briar 1 v 9?
[8:23:06] Cariyla: @Deku_Dreaming it's just kind of confusing cause of those things having the same names
[8:23:10] Cariyla: but that's classic rito tbh
[8:23:13] denunciator: probably will get Qed down by asol
[8:23:15] avuloseunda: So there's nothing that can remove knockups in game?
[8:23:28] Deku_Dreaming: not as far as I'm aware
[8:23:31] denunciator: cc immunity or unstoppable
[8:23:32] Lazynameross: they changed it years ago that you cant do anything to airborne anymore
[8:23:42] Lazynameross: you used to be able to qss to cast other stuff
[8:23:45] soverysour: It s probably because champs with knockuos would be significantly weaker if u could itemize against their cc
[8:23:45] Cariyla: you used to be able to cleanse + flash out of a knock up but
[8:23:47] Cariyla: Now you can't anymore
[8:24:02] denunciator: ... why did it say Unstoppable but you were cced
[8:24:03] softlysupports: eavSmoge
[8:24:04] denunciator: what is that
[8:24:13] Balldropper: dang that was a lot of ppl in that brush
[8:24:22] avuloseunda: Chatting****
[8:24:24] soverysour: Dota also has 3 cc levels, from easiest to impossible to cleanse
[8:24:25] avuloseunda: Chatting dogs
[8:24:27] Cariyla: @soverysour See I would be okay with this if knock ups were still as rare as they used to be but there's over 100 different airborne effects in the game rn
[8:24:27] blushedx: LOSERSQ
[8:24:29] Cariyla: And I hate it
[8:24:29] denunciator: Chatting dogs
[8:24:29] avuloseunda: Chatting ff
[8:24:53] denunciator: right but dota displays what type of cc and what cleanses work if you mouse over the skill
[8:24:57] avuloseunda: League has 17 types of cc
[8:24:59] denunciator: you can just click on them and it'll say
[8:25:00] avuloseunda: Or 14
[8:25:01] soverysour: Ye tru
[8:25:12] avuloseunda: I don't remember the exact number tink
[8:25:17] softlysupports: erm same with league eavNerd
[8:25:24] lichandrin: at least 3 types of cc
[8:25:29] Deku_Dreaming: guys what's your favourite type of cc peepoWow
[8:25:30] denunciator: does mousing over tell you what type of cc and cleanses
[8:25:30] Lazynameross: NODDERS

[8:25:52] Cariyla: my favorite type of CC is when Eve charms me peepoWow

[8:29:58] avuloseunda: So 15 types of cc ?
[8:30:14] Lazynameross: berserk is just a taunt at the end of the day, right?

[8:32:42] soverysour: In dota u also have a billion types of cc but if u click on an enemy hero ur hud changes to their abilities so u can refresh /learn what their skills do. In league you cant do this which sucks
[8:32:45] Lazynameross: wait i thought you could do that in combat

[8:34:08] denunciator: Anathema but no AD
[8:34:13] Cariyla: For some reason Quinn's R2 has the old Revive icon sometimes Gladge
[8:34:14] Lazynameross: dejj unknown value of 900dmg

[8:38:01] Apostolique: LUL
[8:38:06] Slyxx58: I feel like in kit shred has always been good. I remember it coming up several times on pro scene how j4 or rene were only in the comp because they had shred
[8:38:07] Lazynameross: imagine what hed be doing if he didnt bother with malignance
[8:38:08] Apostolique: classic
[8:38:09] kaiserwroth: stunt terrorizing league with off meta picks like vi support COPIUM
[8:38:23] Apostolique: Vi support is hella OP
[8:38:54] Apostolique: Vi's only issue is that she isn't Sion
[8:39:17] arthurchen: Vi support viable?
[8:39:30] Lazynameross: BIG
[8:39:41] SupportSion: Wait did someone say Sion?
[8:39:50] JBP7: @arthurchen VI-able DuckLaugh

[8:40:25] Lazynameross: bla
[8:40:52] avuloseunda: Also its funny how asol was on vision because he used Q

[8:44:38] trowaman: Isn't funny how vi used to be bruiser/off tank, now she's just assassin
[8:45:23] Lazynameross: i was going to say back when it was just armor pen
[8:45:30] Lazynameross: but we're back to it being just armor pen OMEGALUL
[8:45:37] JBP7: or as it was much more sensibly known as back then: armor pen
[8:45:59] Balldropper: Which champ is after vi
[8:46:00] JBP7: makes no sense to call it lethality when its just flat armor pen again
[8:46:05] imosh: season 3 i think
[8:46:30] trowaman: I still want old runes lol
[8:46:34] avuloseunda: Chat what did heaven look like peepoWow you must know since you're an angel :3
[8:46:36] Lazynameross: the response to that was armor pen gave wrong impression whether it did the scaling nonsense or not
[8:46:41] craqzyyy: did you get a haircut?
[8:46:48] Lazynameross: armor pen is for vs tanky targets, lethality for vs squishy
[8:47:00] cluchyy: how come you have all the skins unlocked?
[8:47:08] Lazynameross: but we dont have magic dmg version of this so idk where theyre going with that logic
[8:47:19] Lazynameross: yes
[8:47:31] Lazynameross: you can also proc scorch on q
[8:47:42] denunciator: green tree secondary goes hard  nodd
[8:47:44] ZoeGirl: isnt it that your mark autos twice or something?
[8:47:51] JBP7: yeah you see what I mean its just another vestigial term
[8:48:03] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[8:48:09] denunciator: not Unflinching vs maokai ashe?
[8:48:31] avuloseunda: @lazynameross there is. Shadowflame, sorc boots, stormsurge gives flat pen so its better against squishy targets. Cryptobloom and void staff gives percentage so its good into tanks
[8:48:48] Lazynameross: no i mean we dont have "lethality" but for magic dmg
[8:48:53] Agarus_Exsolutus: viego is perfect to someone that is a 167 trick stuntVibe2
[8:49:07] avuloseunda: Its the same thing though. Theres just no different name
[8:49:11] Lazynameross: if the naming scheme matters so much why did they only do it for that 1 type of dmg
[8:49:16] JBP7: you used to know if it was % pen because it had a % sign AINTNOWAY
[8:49:31] b3llamy: i have a friend who was spamming viego support only for like 2 weeks
[8:49:53] avuloseunda: @b3llamy peepoHey hiiii SoCute gurakeKiss
[8:49:57] b3llamy: hiii
[8:50:04] b3llamy: GM
[8:50:07] Lazynameross: ive read it does some kind of stop animation thingy that fighting games do?
[8:50:14] denunciator: ... they named it lethality because lethality gave flat armor penetration but not all at once, you got 60% of it and the rest of the 40% as you level up
[8:50:16] Lazynameross: hit confirmation or something idk i dont play those
[8:50:20] denunciator: they removed it on 14.1 though
[8:50:22] ashtoniousgg: dorans worth starting on maokai or nah?
[8:50:33] denunciator: and it's to contrast regular armor penetration which just does what it says on the tin
[8:50:55] craqzyyy: did you get a haircut?
[8:50:56] JBP7: @denunciator yeah but then they changed it back so why we still have this weird name, dont matter much anyways but bugs me
[8:51:05] Lazynameross: yeah but a lot of players were asking why not rename it since its just flat pen again
[8:51:41] Lazynameross: lol resigned to death and just trying to get some stackies before he goes
[8:51:56] JBP7: game theory optimal asol
[8:52:00] denunciator: in the scripts it's still called lethality, and also it gives them the chance to bring lethality back
[8:52:05] avuloseunda: If u possess asol at level 1 do u have access to all 3 of his abilities tink
[8:52:14] JBP7: he got his stackers
[8:52:46] Lazynameross: youre whatever status they were at the time
[8:53:09] Lazynameross: this is why some viegos end up griefing themselves possessing someone super weak just cuz they saw a reset LUL
[8:53:36] denunciator: classic viego taking adc body
[8:53:50] JBP7: AYOOO
[8:54:09] Lazynameross: ashe really came back, rip
