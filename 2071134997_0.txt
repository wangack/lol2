[2:03:09] Scruffian: Nasus is desperately stacking in the attempt to carry teamfights and halt splitpushes
[2:03:17] Sonikzo: AP nasus kinda hard to last hit under tower with
[2:03:32] alexvali007: ik ik it was a constatation

[2:03:47] Peace_In_Chaos: plates so delicious
[2:03:50] PrayWMe: @Sonikzo It's not ap nasus prolly
[2:03:56] PrayWMe: It's just dorans ring for e farm mostly
[2:03:59] cereal420x3: might just be going dorans ring for the mana regen
[2:04:07] PrayWMe: Since you have little hope of stacking a lot in this lane
[2:04:08] astro___wolf: @Sonikzo most nasus's start d-ring for the mana regen
[2:04:17] Sonikzo: Looks like E max and dorans it's Ap atm right?
[2:04:18] astro___wolf: and for the more dmg from e
[2:04:26] Ymergrim: @PrayWMe its for mana regen
[2:04:38] TheSteve: nice
[2:04:40] cereal420x3: can i pet that dawg

[2:05:33] PrayWMe: @Neuro_Alpha Average angra song
[2:05:45] metalwrath22222: is this some dragonforce wannabe band
[2:06:04] PrayWMe: @bob_panino12 Active: Trundle drains the life force out of the target enemy champion, dealing magic damage and Heal power icon healing himself for the same amount. He also steals 40% of their current Armor penetration icon armor and Magic penetration icon magic resistance, and increases in size by 18% while reducing the target's size by 9.9%.
[2:06:05] nuzaq: lmao dragonforce is itself a wannabe good powermetal band
[2:06:16] Scruffian: @bob_panino12 steals a percentage of armor and mr and some health from opponent. The tankier they are, the tankier you become while making them squishier
[2:06:18] cereal420x3: ^^
[2:06:23] PrayWMe: @metalwrath22222 You realise angra is from early 90s right

[2:06:49] PrayWMe: Without the 1v1
[2:06:58] PrayWMe: @cereal420x3 Mord r steals stats while in death realm
[2:07:00] PrayWMe: No need to kill

[2:08:03] sowellplayed: so lethal tempo still viable on trundle ?
[2:08:13] scherzon0: yes only option
[2:08:21] sowellplayed: PTA ?
[2:08:24] Scruffian: @bob_panino12 also the percentage is based on the stats at time of Ult. So when you target a champ that temporarily boosts its stats (nasus ult) they get way more stats stolen, causing them to be super frail if timed right
[2:08:43] cereal420x3: oh shit no it's actually AP nasus
[2:08:46] cereal420x3: he rushed lich bane
[2:09:01] bob_panino12: @Scruffian broken
[2:09:32] xDaveJaVu: LOL
[2:09:39] xDaveJaVu: that nasus is tilted
[2:09:41] metalwrath22222: rolled

[2:11:34] cereal420x3: what's he going with that long sword
[2:11:35] Scruffian: @astro___wolf only with stacks involved. It's hoping he eventually outscales, but Trundle won't leave his lane until he reaches nexus LUL

[2:56:04] ViLLePLaTTe: !splitpush
[2:56:04] Nightbot: I play mostly Trundle and Olaf but when I play Trundle and I pressure the sides splitpishing I feel like my allies don't really know what to do. When I bring 2/3 people top they don't go for opposite lane push or neutral objectives like drake. They often stay mid resulting in overstay overpush deaths and blame it on me because I wasn't there with them for a 4v5 fight for example. How do you manage splitpush in lower elos ? The situation I'm describing is mostly with Trundle
[2:56:24] Aldoz: 444
[2:56:51] Scruffian: FeelsRainMan TFW you become numb of your teammates not knowing what to do when you splitpush

[3:18:46] RAYOTHUNDERR: !fiora
[3:18:47] Nightbot: try not to chomp her parry, stay near wall when she ults so she cant get last vital. Not sure if you win level one cause they can just kite. Make sure u do not ult her w extremely important it negates the entire spell everything. DONT q HER W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
