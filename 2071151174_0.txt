[5:09:48] RukiHyena: Awkward
[5:10:18] Dekharen: I love playing vayne but rn I'm always feeling meh with the builds; crit is so much better in lane, but BRK/guinsoo/tank feels so much better later on
[5:10:37] iampilgrim23: which on of u clowns told him to build statik tho
[5:10:49] thebuzzzkilla: @iampilgrim23 IFISPEAK
[5:11:01] thebuzzzkilla: not sniching
[5:11:05] Dekharen: statikk is fairly good right now on her, but that's a completely different build
[5:11:40] AistisSlayer: did you know that rift same as baron makes the person tanking do 50% less dmg?
[5:11:44] ToneDoLOL: surely not uav
[5:11:59] AistisSlayer: i found that being the case like the other day : D
[5:12:08] xcalebur: new this patch
[5:12:11] RukiHyena: yes its build path is broken
[5:12:14] xcalebur: @AistisSlayer added this season ye
[5:12:23] Faramir1993: 2 bows and 1 blade into 1 bow
[5:12:29] Dekharen: I'm pretty sure the recurve passive doesn't stack so that kinda sucks
[5:12:30] Voui: AlienDance
[5:12:40] inflncr: @Dekharen it did idk if they patched it
[5:12:47] RukiHyena: guinsoo's into double recurve  Cooking
[5:13:09] thebuzzzkilla: witsend>terminus 3rd this game imo
[5:13:44] RukiHyena: @thebuzzzkilla wits overrated, its build path is kinda bad imo
[5:13:47] xcalebur: you can use herald to escape
[5:13:49] xcalebur: if you hold it
[5:13:51] xcalebur: nvm
[5:14:28] thebuzzzkilla: @RukiHyena but the tenacity and MR kinda op this game
[5:14:32] xcalebur: my idea was ride it to mid t2 after bot t2
[5:14:43] xcalebur: but this is obv better
[5:15:29] Dekharen: tbf wits is nice because it gives a ton of MR & the damage is deceptively high, but terminus is just great on vayne
[5:15:37] xcalebur: id go titanic hydra next but the weirder the vayne build is the more i like it

[5:17:53] eLPimpaa: i think bork must be always  first iem
[5:17:55] RukiHyena: i feel you just need more survivability so you can auto more
[5:18:13] Aniverr: bork doesnt do anything when he has 20% hp
[5:18:36] iampilgrim23: @xcalebur yesssir
[5:18:55] imajhinious: q+e syndra 60% of your hp fair
[5:19:36] RukiHyena: i feel shieldbow is better here tbh

[5:22:20] Dekharen: cutdown is definitely really good if you dont go green secondary
[5:22:21] RukiHyena: @Dekharen he alrdy got some durability with terminus, good paired with lifesteal, also he probably needs the extra crit
