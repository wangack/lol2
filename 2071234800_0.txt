[3:37:46] azynce: im surprisingly happy with how fair hwei feels to play against
[3:38:04] ronswainson: it levels out to previous AS by mid game i believe, just early game nerf
[3:38:07] HerryNuf: lethal tempo stronger later i think, maybe rn is the break even point?
[3:38:12] amazon_zane: good man about to pack the bags travel to michigan for a lil snowboard weekend with my best friend, watching you while i pack

[3:40:26] moosE3knucklE: they gave him better buffs that nerfs honestly lol
[3:40:28] mewalot: poggers
[3:40:37] Kithlan: After "adjustments", not nerfs Kappa
[3:40:50] shadow7master: adjust not nerfs xdd
[3:41:03] moosE3knucklE: honestly i feel like he got buffs not nerfs. they just made his ult less stupid lol
[3:42:24] moosE3knucklE: but the fact that riot still hasnt fixed the fact that in his Ult (Ksante) he still doesnt take damage. when his ult is supposed to be sacrificing Defense for Offense is why hes so busted
[3:42:50] shadow7master: rakan KEKW
[3:43:46] moosE3knucklE: @fbphilly something like that. because honestly he just does more damage but still takes none lol
[3:43:55] Ray701: certainly a game
[3:44:31] moosE3knucklE: like when i read Ksante's ult.. the first counter i thought of was Garen. when Ksante ults... Garen just ults him and he should die. but it never works lol
[3:45:21] SunYoshi_HS: jax jg so op, i have like 68% wr d2 rn
[3:45:32] SunYoshi_HS: literal inflation KEKW

[3:49:21] VastaLorde: what would be best red kayne build
[3:49:33] shadow7master: pickaxe xdd
[3:49:54] moosE3knucklE: if u just build malignace on Karma it makes life miserable for everyone on the enemy team as long as u can hit ur mantra Q's.
[3:50:07] SunYoshi_HS: jungle gap
[3:51:40] moosE3knucklE: i was watching the LCK last night and i witnessed the most disgusting comp lol. Poppu, Lee Sin, Karma mid, Seraphine, Senna. no one could die lol
[3:52:33] jonsl90: they didn’t even hit the inhib

[3:55:43] KiroTh3Hero: steraks?
[3:55:45] KiroTh3Hero: tenacity
[3:55:57] bubbles9001: why does that hewii champ remind me of Invoker so much

[3:59:32] DJ_Photik: What was your end score
[3:59:40] shadow7master: but look at that volibear dmg wtf
[4:00:03] azynce: critcrank
[4:00:16] Mve_Ur_Bdy: wtf is that champ
[4:00:17] moosE3knucklE: yeah and voli got no damage buffs lol. he was just fine before. no one played him
[4:00:44] Mve_Ur_Bdy: wtf does smolder do chat?
[4:00:48] LoudDerp: that was just dirty
[4:01:02] shadow7master: @Mve_Ur_Bdy he calls his mom
[4:01:16] LoudDerp: @Mve_Ur_Bdy scales
[4:01:28] Mve_Ur_Bdy: is it actually adc?
[4:01:41] moosE3knucklE: it can be played mid too
[4:01:45] DJ_Photik: Cheer100
[4:01:50] jakfrost49: pta build !!
[4:01:57] azynce: whenever i see smolder mid its one of the freest wins ever
[4:01:59] amazon_zane: guys why does smolder scale... because dragon.. ahha get it?? ahhah
[4:02:01] Mve_Ur_Bdy: 3 new champs ive not seen before in this game lol
[4:02:02] DJ_Photik: No skin sadge
[4:02:11] DJ_Photik: Losing LP sadge
[4:02:27] auri_sariel: @Santorin we could get some hogwarts legacy variety on weekend :3
[4:02:30] amazon_zane: you could get better with a skin for sure
[4:02:37] azynce: i thought you had all skins as a pro
[4:02:40] tori_midnight: getting chocolate covered peanuts
[4:02:44] LoudDerp: he might not be lpp
[4:02:44] moosE3knucklE: Smolder in solo que is a coin flip. because smolder requires a slow game to get to a point of taking over. and all of that matters on if the team plays around it or not
[4:02:46] azynce: do you lose that when ur not on a team
[4:02:54] jakfrost49: eclipse , titanic , black cleaver
[4:03:04] DJ_Photik: Isn't that the same for Senna @moose3knuckle
[4:03:40] Mve_Ur_Bdy: I been following since 2015 NotLikeThis
[4:03:41] auri_sariel: @Santorin if you ever do hogwarts legacy variety stream, im literally setting myself and my room as if i was gonna watch a movie in cinema, im getting melted cheese and nachos
[4:03:56] Madrai: that loading screen tip could be changed to 'Rengar is a cat.'
[4:04:00] moosE3knucklE: @dj_photik not really cause senna can be strong with items too. which is why farming senna works. smolder's damage is all stack's based really and getting to 225 for the true damage burn and execute
[4:04:25] DJ_Photik: I meant fasting senna/support
[4:04:30] NachoLazer_: Hello hello HeyGuys
[4:04:45] Madrai: ur rich
[4:04:50] gen3monica: briar TROLL
[4:04:58] shadow7master: the clown fiesta POGGIES
[4:05:05] Kithlan: EZ first blood
[4:05:07] moosE3knucklE: yeah and fasting senna usually comes online around what like 18 to 20 mins which if someone plays smolder right. its like 20 mins to farm up
[4:05:25] LoudDerp: you ran at her so good
[4:05:31] DJ_Photik: Teach us how to Briar poggers
[4:06:00] DJ_Photik: In rank you a dawg
[4:06:17] DJ_Photik: Smurf legit 2nd time Briar in high ELO
[4:06:35] Madrai: It goes to nearest enemy unit (priotizes champ)
[4:06:40] Madrai: Trist got far enough away
[4:06:41] NachoLazer_: Prios champs, but if champ is out of range it takes the closest enemy
[4:06:42] Ray701: hehe yeah the taunt switch is a tilter
[4:06:44] Ray701: she was out of range
[4:07:08] DJ_Photik: You can't pick who to taunt?
[4:07:19] NachoLazer_: @dj_photik Nope
[4:07:20] Madrai: Yeah it's just nearest enemy
[4:07:24] Ray701: @dj_photik nearest target, prefs champs
[4:07:27] Mve_Ur_Bdy: this seems like a complete balls to the wall kinda champ
[4:07:28] StillAkshayV: Is 110 too high to be able to break past emerald
[4:07:32] StillAkshayV: Ping
[4:07:41] Madrai: Ppl have gotten challenger at 200 ping
[4:07:57] DJ_Photik: That blood reminds me of ww
[4:07:59] StillAkshayV: Dang. Im hard stuck
[4:08:06] Kithlan: If you listen to pros, 60 ping is too high LUL
[4:08:06] trashpanda_oz: lord semi might be the best player ever
[4:08:11] Mve_Ur_Bdy: Emerald is a rank now? LUL
[4:08:34] amazon_zane: you could probably one trick maokai with high ping bc hes easy and broken
[4:08:36] DJ_Photik: Op
[4:08:40] DJ_Photik: Just walk back in lolol
[4:08:54] moosE3knucklE: a yes. Yorick. the fun and interactive champion that makes u fight minions all game while he watches lol
[4:08:56] gen3monica: xdd666 briar is coming
[4:09:04] DJ_Photik: Sniffa
[4:09:42] Madrai: Hey, at least you guys are playing together
[4:09:43] Kithlan: Chat, I haven't played in like 6 years, what should I play when I reinstall? Kappa
[4:09:55] moosE3knucklE: sounds good. imma que up and Int too!
[4:10:05] Rhaegar_UGKz: no, no kill there. just sucks as the design
[4:10:10] Madrai: Only way is maybe you hold W slightly longer (not sure if you waited until last second)
[4:10:24] NachoLazer_: E cancels ur taunt, so i dont think its worth after W
[4:10:25] auri_sariel: engage with Q, use W as late as possible, E only as a last resort
[4:10:32] Madrai: But your E wouldn't have hit him unless you were closer and different position to wall
[4:10:34] trashpanda_oz: ur q and w are both auto resets
[4:10:39] trashpanda_oz: which is funny
[4:10:49] auri_sariel: i mean second W
[4:11:01] WingedChipmunk: it's a VERY large learning curve

[4:45:25] insayyyy: i think the ksante is trying to build a new 'drainktank' build. u go unending despair, visage, fimbulwinter, grasp, and secondary indig hunter to reduce ur CD and try to just heal fat throughout a long fight
[4:45:28] Madrai: That was personal
[4:45:34] auri_sariel: no elp
[4:45:35] Chibithulux: No elp
[4:45:38] moosE3knucklE: NOPERS no elp
[4:45:40] Madrai: "Fiddle took our kill so we'll let him die" I bet
[4:45:45] insayyyy: i tried it for volibear cuz its from a KR volibear otp but maybe i suck but the build is so expensive and i feel like i do nothing
[4:46:10] DJ_Photik: Is that Veigo mid??
[4:46:14] moosE3knucklE: yeah
[4:46:18] Madrai: a real man would ult into turret

[4:48:42] Ray701: @auri_sariel we are witnessing it AngelThump
[4:48:43] sebastianminiatures: "I'm losing lane, come hold it for me"
[4:49:04] Madrai: Skarner solos him lol

[4:49:29] auri_sariel: @Ray701 yeah im sure its not cause he started cull and tear KEKW
[4:50:01] DJ_Photik: Midiego

[4:50:17] getsometalentloser: or hour glass more dmg
[4:50:29] Madrai: Shaco got your shutdown at tower
[4:50:32] moosE3knucklE: yeah dunno what the tear is about for Ksante. he got buffed to have more mana this patch too lol
[4:51:05] auri_sariel: so dafoq is the ksante even building with the tear?
[4:51:18] moosE3knucklE: idk. fumblewinter?
[4:51:43] auri_sariel: @moosE3knucklE dafoq he needs that for KEKW
[4:52:32] moosE3knucklE: idk man
[4:52:49] moosE3knucklE: i havent seen anyone build Fumblewinter in forever lol let alone a ksante
[4:53:03] auri_sariel: 10 hp KEKL
[4:53:38] auri_sariel: dude probably started instant ff vote
[4:53:57] jzipfel20: Just fiddling around!
[4:54:00] moosE3knucklE: this Ksante clearly has no idea how to play Ksante and is building idk what. cause that build is aweful
[4:54:25] Dezrunner: And we don't know what you're doing, so there's no chance they know what you're doing
[4:54:27] moosE3knucklE: Ksante just needs Gauntlet, Rookern, Sunfire and hes immortal lol
[4:54:31] Rodacon: How much tenacity does Panth have?
[4:54:36] Rodacon: That silence lasted like .25 seconds
[4:55:00] DJ_Photik: That Viego doing work
[4:55:11] sebastianminiatures: surprise party is a good skin for this fiesta
[4:55:26] auri_sariel: this leona is kinda goated
[4:55:26] moosE3knucklE: the ksante has to be trolling right.
[4:55:55] DJ_Photik: Did you start top side beginning of game?
[4:56:12] vbotanist: 400 + stacks of heathsteel on sup
[4:56:39] ntmadeit: im the kaisa will do it next time

[4:57:28] moosE3knucklE: yeah
[4:57:36] sebastianminiatures: WTF ARE THE ITEMS THIS GAME
[4:57:41] moosE3knucklE: idk what the wits end is about but tank azir is a thing now
[4:57:53] sebastianminiatures: @moosE3knucklE I hate that
[4:58:03] moosE3knucklE: but u build Liandry's Riftmaker then Frozen heart
[4:58:07] moosE3knucklE: on Tank azir
[4:58:20] Doggers_: azir needs therapy for that build
[4:58:32] moosE3knucklE: wits end azir.... Fumblewinter Ksante
[4:58:34] moosE3knucklE: wtf
[4:59:01] moosE3knucklE: who even builds Fumblewinter anymore lol
[4:59:19] auri_sariel: that guy is not just first time ksante playing, he is first time top lane playing cause that build is criminal
[5:00:02] azynce: fiddlesticks, end of men. fiddlesticks, first of ten!
[5:00:20] DJ_Photik: Shyvana next?
[5:00:25] Rhijn: is this gorillaz and vince staples?
[5:00:45] Rodacon: It's impressive that the guy from Blur is also the guy rom Gorillaz, good range of style
[5:00:56] moosE3knucklE: he dies so fast
[5:01:01] moosE3knucklE: because his build is shit
[5:01:04] vbotanist: gonorrea is unstopable
[5:01:37] moosE3knucklE: if he just goes Gauntlet, rookern, frozen heart, that ksante doesnt die ever.
[5:01:39] Madrai: He's goin terminus I guess
[5:01:56] azynce: carry viego is so much fun thouhg
[5:01:57] moosE3knucklE: this game is..... something
[5:02:00] zoki_2706: He know something new
[5:02:16] moosE3knucklE: all i see is people building like its there first time playing the game lol
[5:02:44] azynce: how did skarner just kill ksante in silde lane
[5:02:53] Rodacon: Well, Shaco did defend
[5:03:09] moosE3knucklE: its like they are building via the suggested items... cause the suggested items these day make no sense lol
[5:03:28] auri_sariel: @moosE3knucklE i dont think i ever saw the game suggest me a fimbulwinter KEKW
[5:03:35] moosE3knucklE: hahaha
[5:03:48] moosE3knucklE: idk where he got fumblewinter from but... WHY
[5:03:58] azynce: terminal HUH
[5:04:48] moosE3knucklE: that ksante build is making Ksante look balanced
[5:04:50] auri_sariel: this game has been pulled straight from the depths of iron 4
[5:04:53] DJ_Photik: Carry Viego looks fun lol
[5:05:09] Madrai: HE'S HIM
[5:05:17] Doggers_: Nerf that champ
[5:05:26] DJ_Photik: Skarner top new meta now
[5:05:35] azynce: viego applies onhits and crits like crazy its how he was designed but other items ended up being beter on him
[5:05:37] moosE3knucklE: Santorin are u sure this isnt a bunch of Bronze players in ur game some how. lol cause this is wild
[5:05:40] azynce: its why its so much more fun
[5:05:47] azynce: i hope they refocus him again towards those items

[5:07:31] moosE3knucklE: i thought this game was gonna be a loss looking at the draft... but the normal looking draft trolled harder
[5:07:40] moosE3knucklE: idk what is real anymore
[5:07:43] spaniardface: Chad skarner fr
[5:07:43] auri_sariel: that ksante should be reported for griefing, that dude made ksante looks underpowered
[5:07:52] DJ_Photik: Skarner jg now?
[5:08:00] worldparadise420: that guy is viego
[5:08:03] DJ_Photik: Shy? 👀

[5:10:01] insayyyy: (pre rework Kappa )
[5:10:05] moosE3knucklE: The Udyr tech is be the most annoying champ.
[5:10:06] Madrai: conquerer I think
[5:10:21] Madrai: or press the attack if goin AD
[5:10:23] trashpanda_oz: yea dude
[5:10:26] trashpanda_oz: profane hydra
[5:10:32] Madrai: You could go omega AP and phoenix everyone
[5:10:40] worldparadise420: udyr ban i guess
[5:10:42] Madrai: Somethimes trick does that
[5:11:17] worldparadise420: u gotta do a jungle champ tier list ...since u played so many champs
[5:11:17] moosE3knucklE: Bwipo has been preaching to build some damage on Udyr. either uhhhh Triforce Udyr or Liandry's
[5:11:18] capherick: It looks like an A-Z Challenger Run
[5:11:32] tugwos: Are you playing each one only once, or until a win on each one?
[5:11:41] Madrai: Liandry's is actually pretty standard on udyr
[5:12:05] UnplayableTrash: @Santorin Sett jungle viable
[5:12:18] sebastianminiatures: is there no tiget lethality udyr?
[5:12:19] moosE3knucklE: Triforce is pretty good on Udyr too for AD
[5:12:34] hey_im_rabid: there was a time that I asked lobby chat what jungle champ to lock in and I had to pay Janna jungle several times LUL
[5:12:40] Rhijn: rumble in the jungle?
[5:12:43] dotherightthing7: did he win the skarner game chat?
[5:12:43] UnplayableTrash: @Santorin no bro it totally is
[5:13:16] Mve_Ur_Bdy: I cant wait for the Tham jungle game man
[5:13:19] Chibithulux: Brohax played it recently :D
[5:13:28] moosE3knucklE: apperently some people are doing Ghostblade on Udyr. idk how good it is
[5:13:34] sebastianminiatures: did I miss Amumu?
[5:13:51] UnplayableTrash: I know this guy who is masters+ OTP Sett jungle, name is Santorin...
[5:14:02] DJ_Photik: Diana
[5:14:12] DJ_Photik: Shyvana has scales
[5:14:24] hey_im_rabid: several scales
[5:14:36] hansel_lionheart: burning woman
[5:14:36] spaniardface: gathering storm maybe?
[5:14:43] Madrai: trans/gathering storm
[5:14:47] sebastianminiatures: a tragedy, shame on me and on my family for being late
[5:14:51] Rhijn: have you tried out adjusted rek'sai? Saw meteos saying she does 0 dmg now without E true damage
[5:14:56] DJ_Photik: Ww top, wk mid?
[5:16:03] UnplayableTrash: Yeah I had the feeling Reksai changes would be trash before they even hit. Take all damage and give health regen, little mobility?
[5:16:07] Kimakaze: @Santorin What role do you think is the easiest to learn/climb on for someone new?
[5:16:08] DJ_Photik: Karthus adc okok
[5:16:22] moosE3knucklE: im seeing a PTA Ghostblade lethality Udyr build that looks interesting. idk if its good lol
[5:17:01] DJ_Photik: Support and jg go hand in hand imo
[5:17:23] getsometalentloser: w raptors yeh
[5:17:26] getsometalentloser: thats what augrin does
[5:17:29] moosE3knucklE: yeah Top is rough because u get counterpicked alot and if u dont know match ups u will get shit on hard
[5:17:37] DJ_Photik: Who's Augrin?
[5:17:48] getsometalentloser: @dj_photik nruh
[5:17:51] getsometalentloser: bruh
[5:17:57] DJ_Photik: Me iron
[5:18:12] getsometalentloser: hes a very good jungle player
[5:18:13] worldparadise420: 100% agree jg is tough coz the probability of pathing is so uncertain
[5:18:21] getsometalentloser: who displays  and preaches
[5:18:26] getsometalentloser: constitency over  coin flips
[5:18:28] moosE3knucklE: i started playing Top and it was miserable until i practiced champs that were shitting on me. learning how they play them. takes alot of learning
[5:18:28] DJ_Photik: 👀
[5:18:35] Madrai: If you do a different jg champ every game, you never have to worry about jg bans lol
[5:18:41] hey_im_rabid: pre 6 shyvana ganks are cheeks
[5:18:54] getsometalentloser: @hey_im_rabid thats why u dont gank unless its super freeeeee
[5:18:55] bootiepics: can you only play shiv once regardless if you want to play her tank?
[5:19:08] hey_im_rabid: @getsometalentloser truuuuuuuuuuuue
[5:20:01] moosE3knucklE: basically there really is no easy role. it all takes alot of learning because of so many different match ups and style's of players
[5:20:14] Kimakaze: @Santorin When is the new Skarner coming out? I havent heard any new updates about him in a while
[5:20:20] Madrai: Why is smolder not just playing safe adn going for stacks
[5:20:47] Madrai: ye nashors
[5:21:00] Ray701: shojin liandries riftmaker is pretty good atm
[5:21:12] shadow7master: i miss bruiser shyv Sadge
[5:21:45] Madrai: Killing your own kind :(
[5:21:49] DJ_Photik: Is Udyr still strong? Haven't played him since s6-7
[5:23:40] moosE3knucklE: yeah
[5:23:45] hey_im_rabid: I'm really bad about not muting people
[5:23:46] moosE3knucklE: Udyr is really strong this patch
[5:23:46] LoudDerp: he's seeing pro play rn as a top laner
[5:23:51] DJ_Photik: Changes were to R?
[5:23:59] DJ_Photik: Was there a rework or just changes
[5:24:01] DJ_Photik: Oh
[5:24:03] sebastianminiatures: you're on ornn, just lose lane with grace and let your team carry
[5:24:13] moosE3knucklE: the new items make Udyr strong. like Rookern
[5:24:18] moosE3knucklE: hes so hard to kill
[5:25:10] moosE3knucklE: then his R hurts so fighting him in it is miserable lol
[5:26:14] DJ_Photik: I'll have to give him a try ty moose
[5:26:14] moosE3knucklE: riftmaker is good on shyv i think
[5:26:14] Madrai: sorc boots
[5:26:25] hey_im_rabid: magic pen boots are correct right?
[5:26:31] DJ_Photik: Sorc
[5:26:35] Ray701: both boots are fine
[5:26:45] moosE3knucklE: @dj_photik anytime
[5:27:13] Madrai: that smolder ult did 0 damage
[5:27:13] auri_sariel: i dunno if u needed to flash there
[5:28:24] moosE3knucklE: looks like alot of ppl go Liandry's, Riftmaker, Shadowflame on Shyv
[5:28:32] moosE3knucklE: in any order
[5:29:03] Ray701: shojin is underrated on her for some hybrid action
[5:30:22] moosE3knucklE: yeah shojin too
[5:30:37] Mve_Ur_Bdy: 139 farm Kreygasm
[5:30:43] auri_sariel: @Ray701 Goldburg is a shyvana OTP and he always goes shojin on her
[5:30:47] BigPuffGouda: raba cryptobloom now
[5:30:48] Hook123: Do you get fury faster with levels?
[5:30:55] Ray701: @auri_sariel based
[5:31:35] sebastianminiatures: shojin passive is like dragon force or something right? more dragon theme has to be good
[5:32:19] Madrai: afk farm? say no more
[5:32:32] Madrai: ???
[5:32:34] Madrai: what is that taliyah doing
[5:32:42] Ray701: mejais time to flip the game InuyoFace
[5:34:11] Madrai: Best thing jg can do is not be forced into bad gank/timings just to appease the team and then EVERYONE is behind
[5:34:15] lairdd2: How much AP are you at?
[5:34:28] moosE3knucklE: the new rift kinda feels good for Shyv. u can come flying out of no where now for ganks lol
[5:34:45] lairdd2: Switch view. Runes stats suck
[5:34:53] sebastianminiatures: I've got a clip from one of your plays after the game
[5:36:16] moosE3knucklE: or u make warwick ult away haha

[5:38:25] sebastianminiatures: can I get a permit for the clip? :)

[5:44:38] auri_sariel: @thee_briefcase this duo q is a big outrage to the public, people are not a fan when a pro or ex pro is boosting his gf via a smurf

[5:52:16] auri_sariel: @BigBylan you can pick what u want to mute, if pings, chat or etc
[5:52:26] auri_sariel: usually the mute button mutes everything
[5:52:53] auri_sariel: well not usually, but always
