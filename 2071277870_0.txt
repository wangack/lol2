[0:57:57] Revenant_EU: !rank
[0:57:57] siwi_x_noname01: @toop do ti then kid
[0:57:58] nubishtryhard: Its funny how people that are probably lower rank than you  doubt to your expertise. At the weirdos out there. If you think that your opinion has any form of value, start streaming yourself and prove dantes wrong instead of giving him c.
[0:57:58] sora2fly: @parkerpatrol obvious answer since no eu player wastes their time going to na and only 4-5 na players have ever gotten chall on euw
[0:57:59] dantesslave: @orhannberkk it kidna is... his r cd is huge no? and hitting w really aint that hard. you learn to hit it after a few games
[0:58:02] xaxaxaaxxaxaxa: @Rodakowsky_ blade guinsoo gg

[0:58:25] siwi_x_noname01: @toop i thought so you are probably silver or gold
[0:58:31] sleepyhxllow: @pop_smoke_______ true omE
[0:58:31] thebrookly: @bedrockshovel_ No and yes, the harderst part of playing him is that u should carry and end the game early, otherwise u'll be hella useless in late game
[0:58:31] fresh_licks_: @Dantes basically ur saying right click heroes like viego takes more skill than heros like riven, irelia etc ?
[0:58:33] Rodakowsky_: @xaxaxaaxxaxaxa still, yi without sth like taric/lulu getting nuked the fk down, guinso and botrk wouldn't change it, taric or lulu would tho

[0:59:18] Search117: yi gets one kill early game and murders your family
[0:59:19] siwi_x_noname01: @toop exactly yi is easy to play in that ranks come up to high diamond/masters
[0:59:20] xaxaxaaxxaxaxa: @Rodakowsky_ no bro there are many counter picks and they will obv focus on hypercarry most of the time, yi aint 1 cc they can go tank items as well true dmg will proly be like on 3 sec cdr with stacked lt and guinsoo regardless the build
[0:59:26] TM_THELEGEND: you still die to him rocheh
[0:59:28] barrdass69: plus yi can reset auto every 2 sec if he keeps atrtacking late game

[1:04:20] dantesslave: @grayzray any movement is low cd when maxed, using same logic we can argue that katarina is easy, unlike ekko its actually hard... at least from what ive played her
