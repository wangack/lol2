[0:48:35] watermeelon_juice: that would explains why riot always do sth about my report !!
[0:48:39] Plausibly_Sane: i regularly get the "a report you made caused a punishment."
[0:48:43] Azmod3ous: I had an old acquaintance got suspended for false reporting
[0:48:47] batuanbey: access to twitch access just got banned in Turkey :s
[0:48:58] Darkcyter: @SafariHobo 83 kaypHYPERS WB
[0:49:05] CynicalScrub: looking forward to the 6 hour stream to get me through my treatment today, @KayPea :) hola mama
[0:49:36] via_trita: update the scoreboard KP still at 0-0 :P
[0:49:57] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: Is it true that you can get a penalty from LOL for pinging to much? I had a friend that got put on a 15 minute time out with that being the reasoning
[0:50:02] hunglikehamster: Good Morning Mrs. Streamer, hope the day is going well for ya
[0:50:05] tulatulips: Omg i was just about to ask if youve played buffed ahri yet
[0:50:09] tacobean1: How're the aminals doing
[0:50:09] loIol0000: Hey keypea! Haven't seen your stream in a while! (maybe a couple years) just wanted to let you know that you look happier and healthier (idek what that means just a feeling) than a few years back (you were already great don't get me wrong), anyway I hope it's the case, keep it up with the great vibes :)
[0:50:33] xxquenton: hi hi kaypWOW kaypRainbow
[0:50:37] murkihonest: eeyy ahri game, love to see it kaypAyyy
[0:51:13] watermeelon_juice: I deadass thought your dog was a pillow
[0:51:15] via_trita: makes since if you ping spam pointlessly though, its the same as chat abuse in a sense
[0:51:19] Plausibly_Sane: @DXSMOKINGMONKEY i mean, if you use every ping cooldown the entire match. that's just spamming/distracting on purpose. forces your team to mute you and wastes their time and prevents proper communication. so ya; it'd be trolling
[0:51:19] Darkcyter: @xxquenton @CynicalScrub kaypHello kaypHello
[0:51:23] Iikingsalmon703ii: do you play katarina too?
[0:51:29] Darkcyter: kaypFreya

[0:51:39] alexandra_h_p: i dont see many janna players these days
[0:51:46] tulatulips: What are your secondary runes?
[0:51:57] Smoothcollie: Hey guys kaypHello
[0:52:19] via_trita: the doggo is a good representation of how KP feels. If the doggo is sleeping, KP 100% is tired
[0:52:27] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: @Plausibly_Sane its wasnt any more egregious then normal or what we see in KP stream most days. it was weird
[0:52:56] tulatulips: Btw i wasnt backseating i was just curious hehe
[0:52:58] via_trita: knocked out like a light
[0:52:59] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: She said, "mom, no"
[0:53:03] layeuna: xD
[0:53:07] tacobean1: She's like "5 more minutes mom"
[0:53:16] Jaguar542: The pillow has :O
[0:53:37] let_james_play: Hi Happy Friday
[0:54:22] alexandra_h_p: W first onAhri to farm easier?
[0:54:53] via_trita: wtf was the e?
[0:55:16] theenation97: when matchmaking affects even your charms
[0:55:22] Natalia3123: 4sec????
[0:55:23] alexandra_h_p: i hate galio
[0:55:27] murkihonest: oof
[0:55:34] tacobean1: Thats a giant stone bird for you,
[0:55:36] AllOfKingsPotato: TrollDespair
[0:55:40] shedfirekid1: wait prediction?
[0:55:43] VanillaEssenceLoL: he is also broken in wild rift
[0:55:56] itsyune_: gotta love the tank damage
[0:56:08] Plausibly_Sane: i only play urf when it's a game mode. you should see galio there xD
[0:56:24] no_diet_yes_cupcake: to be fair? in this game?  nothing is fair in this game lol
[0:56:26] via_trita: Oh I got it KP
[0:56:35] shedfirekid1: nexus vs surrender pred?
[0:56:38] CynicalScrub: have you had to play against full AP tahm kench yet?  it's so dumb, so tanky, so much dmg, can't get away
[0:57:19] Azmod3ous: i miss the mr shred on ahri's e tbh it needs to be brought back too many tank items
[0:57:37] CipherAdminShady: damn he managed to get a kill still
[0:57:40] Smoothcollie: Party in the river
[0:57:58] Jaguar542: @Plausibly_Sane There are URF right now
[0:57:58] FiveFM: kaypHello
[0:58:23] via_trita: your e missed cause he charged to hit the side of your hitbox, not directly, so you throwing it out directly to were he started the charge missed
[0:58:25] markella_andri: Supp assist? For casino
[0:58:50] Elqor: Galio is the perfect anti mage
[0:59:24] malllymore: think the music can come up a bit, sounds nice
[0:59:44] Elqor: I remember the old Galio, that ult was obnoxious as hell
[1:00:01] Jaguar542: He is good against ap champs and bad against ad champs
[1:00:24] let_james_play: according to the wiki his dash can only be interupted by death, so i think thats why the first charm missed
[1:00:46] kral_robert: Hello
[1:01:17] batuhilalow: Omg they just closed twitch in Turkey thank god I'm living abroad now üò≠
[1:01:50] ElminstersGhost: That's every tank now though.
[1:01:56] guiltyprawn: The anti-mage part is fine. But the dmg output is too much monkaS
[1:02:10] Smoothcollie: @let_james_play Nooo, the charm completely missed, not being interrupted means it has prio over any cc (I think) = it won't stop the animation, and the knockup
[1:02:28] snarfiedoo: ah yes the tanks that are able to one shot people
[1:02:49] oksalan: cough cough ksante
[1:02:50] ElminstersGhost: Like K'Sante
[1:02:55] ElminstersGhost: haha
[1:02:59] Jaguar542: is W gives him twice the resistance against AP dmg compared to AD dmg
[1:03:02] let_james_play: @Smoothcollie fair enough
[1:03:04] no_diet_yes_cupcake: @batuhilalow wrong information btw they banned kick platform not twitch ...
[1:03:05] DerpyMailbox: illaoi and darius be like
[1:03:06] VanillaEssenceLoL: idk how about you but when I started tanks were tanking not assassins
[1:03:09] via_trita: 5-0
[1:03:20] Smoothcollie: @let_james_play For example Panth stun (the leap) doesn't have a big prio, meaning u can stop it in mid-anination, for example with Quinn E
[1:03:23] let_james_play: but Ksante was weak and needed a buff /s
[1:03:40] d0nl1on: hi üëãüèºüíê
[1:03:46] Llibulan: i always get confused when casters say that udyr top deals no damage in pro play. Like sir thats what tanks are
[1:04:04] snarfiedoo: reminds me when ornn was able to do tons of damage with a rotation of his spells
[1:04:45] let_james_play: tanks should deal damge but over time, forcing you to decide do you let the tank keep hitting you while trying to kill the damage dealers or do you get rid of the tank
[1:04:53] oksalan: phreak season :)
[1:05:20] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea there is no downside to tanks doing damage, riot said ‚Äúfuck you mages and adcs‚Äù
[1:05:25] meep_: the fact that so many assassins can build almost full tank and still oneshot... kaypRiot
[1:05:45] darjar12: hii
[1:06:08] oksalan: its because melee ap champs are tankier then range ones @KayPea
[1:06:09] let_james_play: ADC is fun, when everyone who looks your way blows you up
[1:06:23] oksalan: and more item versitility
[1:06:25] murkihonest: i think we better start maining fiora , true damage is nuts
[1:06:37] Smoothcollie: The dodges. The engage kaypSip kaypSpy wp
[1:06:43] DerpyMailbox: !followage

[1:06:48] let_james_play: @murkihonest didnt she just get nerfed
[1:06:53] rebelaspect: HI KELSIE!
[1:07:04] Smoothcollie: kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe
[1:07:04] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea time to make a tank ahri build just to survive galio ü§£
[1:07:15] Llibulan: Azir tank is a thing now apparently
[1:07:17] VanillaEssenceLoL: if you can‚Äôt beat them join them
[1:07:46] oksalan: no that wasnt the reeason i was saying they are tnakier
[1:07:47] let_james_play: also life steal on tanks is way to high
[1:08:14] GibsonGaming: Tanks should take damage not give it
[1:08:15] Jaguar542: His Q did 305 dmg building full AP, how much dmg does Ahri Q do now?
[1:08:23] CynicalScrub: riot's mindset:  "it's harder for melee to get in range, so make them do more dmg when they do it"
[1:08:48] peacexbro: peacexbro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Hey KayPea! Been a while since I've dropped in, hope your games are going well

[1:13:59] via_trita: lmao, i didn't realize you could do that, basically countered it
[1:13:59] sequelsarenotcanon: wonder if the charm works while its ridden

[1:20:42] HydroMerano: I hope your back is gonna be okay after this game, its gotta be sore after carrying them all this far.
[1:20:45] Calleson: u had a smolder top or jungle?
[1:20:47] Calleson: or ad?
[1:20:56] HydroMerano: They were top Calleson
[1:21:01] CynicalScrub: @darjar12 yeah, she was a sweetheart
[1:21:06] sequelsarenotcanon: riding the rift gives displacement immunity so i think theyre immune to yopur charm then
[1:21:07] murkihonest: trundle is the next right click master (question mark)
[1:21:11] CrazyCortez: !cannon

[1:24:37] eliotxshadowfrost21: guys i stretched in my sleep this morning and woke up to a massive cramp in my calf. what a day it has been already, i can barely walk now and cant fully stretch my leg when i walk...
[1:24:40] yanjii: didnt they actually put it in this season? although i dont feel it
[1:24:46] HydroMerano: I do wonder how the game would go if there was performance based LP gains and losses.
[1:24:54] Plausibly_Sane: i feel like "performance based" lp would instantly backfire. people playing to KDA instead of macro/win
[1:24:56] Phantomspower: hello streamer maginkHEY
[1:25:00] Deveix: well at the end of the day... it's win or loss, nothing u can do
[1:25:01] yanjii: well that makes a lot of sense
[1:25:02] charmythelittle: Hello @kaypea kaypLove can i ask you what happened?
[1:25:12] via_trita: KP what would you say the best burn/bleed champs are? ie liandry's/morello
[1:25:21] xBoomShotBaby: i still cant get back to Emerald, i just demote to Plat 2 and then come back to Plat 1
[1:25:28] HydroMerano: @Plausibly_Sane I feel like they could change weights on that end, to make it a healthy mix.
[1:25:29] fluffycloudlove: the need to add coding for if it seems people aren‚Äôt trying they get penalized instead of whole team
[1:25:30] CynicalScrub: i'm way too on top of gambas
[1:25:31] alluring_grace: As a champ Ahri can't 1v5. Like as fed as she gets it's not the same as a fed Yone or Katarina.
[1:25:38] theenation97: maybe they‚Äôre resistant to add that since it‚Äôs a team based game. basically you rise and fall with your team ‚Äòequally‚Äô
[1:25:41] Lenox013: Me - *wins lane, roams well, high kill participation, good CS* - RIOT - "ummm, yeah, that was still a loss - -30 LP" :(
[1:25:49] rebelaspect: you got this!
[1:25:54] sequelsarenotcanon: it was performace based wouldnt that effect teamwork so people will play for themselves
[1:26:07] BiSettual: Idk why but I have a feeling you'll get adc LUL
[1:26:10] rebelaspect: have you ever found someone in soloq that you‚Äôve wanted to duo with?

[1:27:09] charmythelittle: @darkcyter kaypHello
[1:27:12] Cybrixz: I'm serious my match history is streaks of wins and loss streaks it's never w/l/w/l. Always like 4 wins 4 losses... makes sense right? To keep my around 55% w/l
[1:27:19] Deveix: but yet people value it much more than anything else, which is frustrating.
[1:27:40] alluring_grace: @Darkcyter cantaKia
[1:27:46] fluffycloudlove: @kaypea I saw someone play tahm kench into top lane kasante and their tank build let them 1v3 and his e shield healed him for double the damage took not broken at all

[1:28:44] via_trita: KP what would you say the best burn/bleed champs are? ie liandry's/morello
[1:28:45] murkihonest: Riot be like "here is your S , Now here is your loss streak"
[1:28:52] ItsAMoll: thoughts on mid karma?
[1:28:58] BerserkerJak: This is an issue a lot of online games suffer from :/ MMR is terrible
[1:29:06] Cybrixz: I shouldn't lose 25 lp when I'm 13-1-10
[1:29:09] Arisutra: have they confirmedthey're introducing it?
[1:29:10] cuteamoeba: hiii bestiee

[1:29:31] Q_taco: hello !
[1:29:35] shedfirekid1: been seeing birb a lot support too
[1:29:44] VanillaEssenceLoL: do you see the tank meta coming to an end?
[1:29:58] Psychology___: I mean isn't there a fair shot MMR is that way already? Just not LP?
[1:30:03] miss_stratus: it is the worst that you either have to choose over your cs or helping your team
[1:30:09] Smoothcollie: kaypCheer A kaypCheer N kaypCheer I kaypCheer V kaypCheer I kaypCheer oh wait...
[1:30:12] shedfirekid1: @vanillaessencelol it‚Äôs been tank meta for like 6 seasons lol

[1:30:33] taiilee: People will always complain
[1:30:43] via_trita: BibleThump
[1:30:45] Cybrixz: Or they need to punish people for being 0-10-1
[1:30:47] let_james_play: i think the issues, is you may get an S rating, but it the loss may be because in the last team fight you made a miss play that resulted in the loss, so while during the majority you were good at the end you caused the loss
[1:31:29] miss_stratus: riot needs to not put only a temp fix on it but evaluate the entire situation bc I think everyone on the same boat on this
[1:31:33] taiilee: What about the 0-10-1 players that Split push all game and take basically all the structures
[1:31:38] rebelaspect: Overwatch just brought back performance based rank
[1:31:42] Deveix: Well, the LP mitigation is a thing and it has been happening more to me when i hard lose, despite my good performance. Perhaps it's just luck on my end.
[1:31:48] Arisutra: i reckon they're "looking into it" = working out if it'll make more people leave than the current system is making people leave
[1:31:56] Cybrixz: Some people have some real mental gap lol
[1:31:59] shedfirekid1: @kaypea dh stack pred?
[1:32:06] let_james_play: i dont disagree with that, just playing devils advocate
[1:32:10] TomNova: Hai KP and everyone! Happy Friday kaypFlower
[1:32:14] Arisutra: zero doubt in my mind they already know how to implement it, it's just working out if it'll cost them players
[1:32:16] ObsceneSanity: cant say riot doesnt know ho to do performance based rating either when val already does it
[1:32:24] eliotxshadowfrost21: i agree with performance based lp loss, the only thing i worry about with it is people then choosing to not participate when they are ahead in a losing match because they dont want their loss to be more significant.
[1:32:31] PainOfDemise: I see where you're going with that, but you can't base it off of that. As  especially as a jungler, I could be doing everything right and I won't get a good rating because I'm not focused on CSing because I'm too busy ping ponging back between lanes to help them, or they want to constnatly aram.
[1:32:33] jocoke: you do know your stream is delayed by about 10 seconds or so?
[1:32:49] VanillaEssenceLoL: would reports count?
[1:33:05] VanillaEssenceLoL: I think reports should count into LP loss
[1:33:07] TomNova: Can't imagine how these people deal with real life if that's their attitude to the game
[1:33:17] via_trita: last time trying to ask cause i dont wanna keep posting this: KP what would you say the best burn/bleed champs are? ie liandry's/morello
[1:33:30] miss_stratus: I can't stand getting on a ranked game and people just talk so much the entire team loses
[1:33:37] ObsceneSanity: theres already a plan to handle high reported accounts. idk if its in effect or not though
[1:33:41] rebelaspect: Overwatch just brought back performance based ranking
[1:33:46] let_james_play: also what about scaling champs, they may be playing well but stats arnt great because they havnt come online yet and then the game ends before they can impact, would they get punished more?
[1:33:46] layeuna: There should be a psychology test when you download Lol to put the sane ppl together so mad ppl don't ruin their game
[1:33:47] doublemeatpalace: @TomNova The game is where the probably vent.
[1:33:55] Smoothcollie: @painofdemise Well if u would perform well and get the lanes ahead, u would do what jugnlers do and thus getting rewarded? I'm sure rito can figure shit out
[1:34:01] Lenox013: They could even use the grades  to balance the system - if everyone gets A/S on a loss, then everyone is probably pretty close in skill - if 1-2 get A/S and 2 get C/D - then you know where the problems likely were
[1:34:13] TomNova: @doublemeatpalace you're probably right too
[1:34:42] PainOfDemise: @Smoothcollie When it comes to rito and jungle, they can't figure shit out.

[1:35:07] let_james_play: i think for performance based rating, your performance needs to be compared to av champ performance and lane performance of your current rank, just my two cents :)
[1:35:08] Arisutra: better to have an imperfect solution than a perfect problem
[1:35:13] Smoothcollie: @painofdemise Not wanting and not being able to is difference
[1:35:26] ObsceneSanity: @let_james_play i thought it is now?
[1:35:39] Q_taco: !
[1:35:52] VanillaEssenceLoL: not everyone will always be happy but majority of the people should be happy

[1:36:34] HydroMerano: Another thing too is, it'll help make it easier to detect win traders, because it'll make it harder for them to get pushed up for poor gameplay.
[1:36:37] Limerencez: kaypCheer kaypHello
[1:36:42] let_james_play: @ObsceneSanity i have no idea, doesnt seem like it

[1:37:20] luminosity_light: Go home
[1:38:11] let_james_play: at the end of the day something needs to change, everyone seems to complain about LP gains and loss so its clearly a big issue
[1:38:32] murkihonest: i think we as a players have the right to say anything to make things a lot more enjoyable for the game, but riot just decide put us in recycle bin instead
[1:38:32] goomba_gaijin: !lurk

[1:39:54] KiriariQT: KiriariQT subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I'm back again. Thanks for making work tolerable :)
[1:39:54] PainOfDemise: I'd prefer them to base it off your w/r. If you have a higher w/r, you earn more lp. If you have a lower w/r you earn less, to like a 50/50 lp gain and lost as you're in your actual ranking and then when you get better, your win rate will go up along with your lp gains to get you out into your new ranking you're suppose to be at.
[1:39:54] shedfirekid1: that slow lasted forever
[1:39:58] Ryscha: what is your opinion on a early mr item vs a lb as lux to counter all in?
[1:40:18] Daddy_Shoe: hello kaypea and chat, happy friday!
[1:40:20] Darkcyter: @KiriariQT WB
[1:40:44] Lenox013: that just reminded me of old runes - stacking the CDR runes
[1:40:55] Darkcyter: @Ryscha @Daddy_Shoe kaypHello kaypHello

[1:41:12] Daddy_Shoe: @Darkcyter kaypHello
[1:41:13] VanillaEssenceLoL: I think it is weird because it‚Äôs a team game so people may think team aspect is lost because I have seen this before where they don‚Äôt care if we lose as long as their KdA is in tact.
[1:41:20] Phieldworker: do you take build requests?
[1:41:33] sami0_0plays: ohhhh hiiii queeen
[1:41:38] Smoothcollie: @painofdemise For how long have u been playing lol? This doesn't sound right, cuz rito keeps you purposely at 50% win rate
[1:41:58] PainOfDemise: Many years.
[1:42:52] Lunaremis: Aloooo
[1:42:55] VanillaEssenceLoL: yah I think it really depends on what and how they would formulate it.
[1:43:01] PainOfDemise: And they're not trying too hard, or nobody would climb,.
[1:43:14] GuilderPNP: :(
[1:43:54] PainOfDemise: In the end of the day no matter what, if you got the skill and are good, you'll climb. Just will probably be a nice grind.
[1:44:13] FiveFM: Did you just get barrier baited!? LUL
[1:44:18] PainOfDemise: And a lot of people don't want to do that grind.

[1:45:41] Darkcyter: @Just_a_PixeI WB
[1:45:41] FreeNights: But isn't it in Riot's interests to keep the grind? For a f2p game, they want you to play as much as possible
[1:45:42] Darkcyter: @Endeavour_NOR WB
[1:45:48] Darkcyter: @FiveFM kaypHello
[1:46:18] Smoothcollie: And yet, u think everyone can suddenly overcome their mmr, that hardly changes over years, without any hard reset of mmr, that would help s lot of acc. @painofdemise If u are good and have skill, u should be pleased with this current system. Cuz if u are good, u can climb now.
[1:47:06] Plausibly_Sane: jokes on them. i only grind to gold for the skin and call it a day. idgaf about pushing past that
[1:47:10] FreeNights: So true! Like, I only play until I reach Gold per season, then I stop playing that season because I hate the climb lol They don't make much money off me bc I don't play much
[1:47:13] Phieldworker: I like playing and what not. I just wish players wouldn‚Äôt have shitty mentals to keep the games from being so one sided.

[1:48:38] Deveix: he a skinny legends KEKL
[1:48:55] Darkcyter: @khadapys kaypHello
[1:48:59] Plausibly_Sane: must be the pesticide resistance the bed bugs got. ziggs needs to diversify the bug termination strats
[1:49:00] PainOfDemise: @Smoothcollie Not saying I couldn't. Just don't have the time, nor the stable internet connection to do so. And if you win enough, your mmr gets better over time. If skill didn't matter, how does anyone climb? People climb all the time with crap MMR. It just takes awhile.
[1:49:03] igotbred: When we seeing more Hwei gameplay uwu
[1:49:11] sami0_0plays: is new luden feels better?
[1:49:18] sami0_0plays: with new buff
[1:49:49] PainOfDemise: @Smoothcollie And most peope don't want to invest that time, like I said. That's why most just make new accounts instead of try and fix their old ones.
[1:50:18] ObsceneSanity: luden isnt a great item still but a must have on burst mages still
[1:50:26] BeastcoastB: yoooo wadup
[1:50:35] Smoothcollie: @painofdemise

[1:53:55] Plausibly_Sane: sounds like people would just churn through more accounts. making the lower ranks even more of a smurf hellscape
[1:54:15] Gossamer_DT: I hate to disagree with that, there are players that have the only goal of playing it to tilt others into getting reported, if riot fixed those players than that system would work
[1:54:23] kubays79: true XD
[1:54:37] kubays79: how is your friday going so far vtw
[1:54:40] kubays79: btw

[2:37:14] Teekwan: I had such a frustrating game yesterday just cause i didn't ban Senna. First time i saw Yuumi as a worthy ban, and the enemy team picked Senna. Thankfully my brother, duo, helped me keep my cool and we won that game, despite them getting two easy kills on me from bushes PopNemo
[2:37:21] danielsanwaxoff: what are your thoughts on the curret state of boosted players
[2:37:34] catastrofia: play defense to win bbs

[2:41:47] catastrofia: o wait that's all of them
[2:41:54] SetupToFail: missed cause of elevation
[2:41:57] Martybggg: probably because you were in the river and he was in the jungle so high ground low ground
[2:42:04] Hymuno: u shot from river, so since it was uphill riot was like yo you should have aimed this 1 mile to the right
[2:42:23] ObsceneSanity: The high/low ground needs to go. it doesnt have a place in this game lol
[2:42:48] via_trita: even still, lux rises in the air to do her ult so it should cancel out
[2:42:49] chotto3: pepeD pepeD
[2:42:59] FiveFM: kaypVibe
[2:43:06] SetupToFail: elevation and lollipopping make for fun skillshot roulettes

[2:47:44] HelloOctoberly: @ahkabunny no problem. It's super frustrating when you play a skill shot champ kaypRiot
[2:47:58] via_trita: sylas was just trying to pad numbers by targeting you entire time and youre ult helps spread dmg amongst team instead of single champ

[2:49:23] J_to_the_jf: your straw is upside down LUL the ring is to stop the straw from falling out of the cup

[2:52:57] ragtimediddly: benefits of a big company that went WFH early in the pandemic and paid for people's home setups
[2:53:01] torsuff: do you like colorful ones?
[2:53:14] Calleson: aaah okay, makes sense
[2:53:38] SpyplaneSniper: White is dope, for 3 months. Then it doesn't look as nice lol
[2:54:10] SpyplaneSniper: tan... grooooosssss
[2:54:14] ragtimediddly: Is the gamer look worth the years of back pain tho?
[2:54:17] Calleson: i think its gonna be alright, more of ur nice background as u say
[2:54:18] KinKaray: This is a standing desk, but Kelsie is so tall that she needs to seat to use it. You all don't know, but Kelsie is 9'' tall and lives up on the sky by the Magic Beanstack, going full "Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell a little Sylas"... And now my weird creativity is over, and I'll sit in the corner! LUL
[2:55:01] jocoke: check out the dowinx gaming chair on amazon
[2:55:01] thetruedarklight: I feel like office chairs are often more ergonomic than gaming chairs but most of those don't have the gamer look
[2:55:02] SpyplaneSniper: @ragtimediddly Ive been super happy with my secretlabs. Not as good as a herman miller, but compared to my old office chairs I feel so much better
