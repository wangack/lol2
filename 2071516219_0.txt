[1:47:01] HeiressOfRuin: Garen and stuff like that are best for learning macro
[1:47:05] HeiressOfRuin: since you don't have to focus on mechanics
[1:47:12] bobano53: @puckad_ it hard to tell that cause all champs are different , i think that it's the best to find 2-3 champs that you like to play and just play play and play
[1:47:14] raivato: @puckad_ with garen u can learn all that and more
[1:47:16] bobano53: you will be learning by reps
[1:47:32] RANGERZX: jol

[2:09:42] bocchigrrr: Yone with grasp is it good?
[2:09:47] Wind_The: @HeiressOfRuin i mean, dzukill is chall and she is low/mid masters so it feels that way

[2:10:15] HeiressOfRuin: Just feels really off
[2:10:21] Wind_The: @bocchigrrr i mean, it rly is OK, but just going lethal is always better
