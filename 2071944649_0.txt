[3:14:57] goodname223: Fiora is too squishy this season
[3:14:59] strimmin: i think fiora needs more hp so she can fight juggernauts
[3:15:01] khalidbinwal: he is assuming you are just going to insta use it every time

[3:18:40] mark02: Yes, but I make way more with a regular job instead :p
[3:18:54] mark02: I would barely be able to make rent doing it now and I enjoiy the game too much to ruin it anymoire
[3:18:57] masterfdestruction: The zac was gm by himself tho
[3:19:02] meemi1337: Viper could you please play one Camille game,Never seen would be epic,It's strong now

[3:40:00] siekx: @plsboom did they chang erav hydra too?
[3:40:36] plsboom: uh the full changes should be bc 24->25% armor red and stacks alot faster. Rav heals +50% more on active
[3:40:57] Hykeir: doesn't kogmaw scale well?
[3:41:33] Khayaz: if u lose u pay 3 months of subs?
[3:42:04] JamesBoboFay: @hykeir I guess but way too many adcs worth playing over kog rn. haven’t seen a kog in my game since like last season lol
[3:42:31] GlitterGaze: kog ap?
[3:42:32] Khayaz: na nvm thats selfish
[3:42:33] Hykeir: @JamesBoboFay i mean the terminus + cleaver change could be good
[3:42:34] GlitterGaze: bruh
[3:42:47] Chrisssan: if that's tactical, can't you rely on him to scale and carry?
[3:44:19] JamesBoboFay: @hykeir I can’t imagine it’s enough to make kog worth picking over the meta picks. I’m not saying kog is bad but It’s one of the last adcs I’d want to see on my team

[3:48:06] nxtrl: u believe wrong
[3:48:33] nxtrl: 200 armor
[3:48:33] Chrisssan: UNIQUE – FERVOR: Dealing physical damage grants you 20 bonus movement speed for 2 seconds.

[3:50:16] exzure: is ap kog good again?
[3:50:32] Chrisssan: no, you said it confusingly, and i interpreted so. you made a definiteie statement with such ego so i posted the description
[3:50:36] plsboom: if an item gave 60 movespeed, it'd be bis on so many champions lmao
[3:50:47] Chrisssan: there were parts where you were wrong
[3:50:58] Chrisssan: but you go " NOPE I WAS 100% RIGHT"
[3:50:58] imibby_: voli is so op
[3:51:05] xyz_abc: @Chrisssan to be honest mate there was no ambiguity in what he said

[4:41:25] athathedruid: ok but at one point in the past they didn’t have video games at all so how’d we go from that to now, what happened, and why didn’t it happen in say Japan, or the Netherlands, or Zimbabwe the same way it happened specifically to Korea, especially in the past like what 60 years exclusively

[4:42:16] Chrisssan: @athathedruid korea always dominated in strategy games since 1990s. it's jsut that most Americans didn't notice it until league.
[4:42:44] ducksayqwak: ducksayqwak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! thx for showing the replay
[4:42:58] Chrisssan: @athathedruid to put it simply, more americans play COD over Starcraft 2
[4:43:03] athathedruid: so my question is why do Koreans dominate strategy games when like 100 years ago they were mostly illiterate farming nation
[4:43:20] athathedruid: what happened
[4:43:33] felicosiano: Bc they learn and work very hard to achieve things dude @athathedruid
[4:43:35] Chrisssan: @athathedruid idk the answer to that lol. other than insanely dedicated mentality i guess
[4:43:55] athathedruid: did some president come in in the 80s and force everyone to game 12 hours a day or how’s it happen

[6:08:37] SpeirsLIVE: nah becuase its against the rules
[6:08:49] lolkotek: they baited you w vayne skin just to ban. wild
[6:08:56] Chrisssan: IMO rito should sell lv 30 account services. they'd make so much money.
[6:09:03] 00001991: they should sell bots
[6:09:07] iam_popo: If riot doesnt want people to buy accounts they should do something about it
[6:09:08] Chrisssan: League doesn't have new playerbase anymore
[6:09:11] SpeirsLIVE: they know its against the rules when buying it tho

[6:10:23] lolkotek: what is the reason for the no rank grind fr
[6:10:28] Chrisssan: you can buy to be lv 30 with 20 champs . then Riot would make so much money
[6:10:33] BrotherLamp1: one team fight goes wrong he just resets on 2 people gets 2 shut downs strong again
[6:10:33] dattotem: you get all champs if you have gamepass on xbox.. lol
[6:10:37] iam_popo: Or like Smite? you can buy all champs there for like $10 i think?
[6:10:38] Chrisssan: and you won't have to waste time leveling accounts
[6:10:38] dattotem: @Viper
[6:10:48] zackk_lol: I feel like people would get banned on purpose to just get a new fresh acc if they ranked goes bad
[6:10:50] dattotem: @Viper You legit get ALL CHAMPS if you have gamepass with xbox.
[6:10:59] lordbayn88: right should allow all account when u reach a certain lvl to buy a lvl 30 alt they would make a killing
