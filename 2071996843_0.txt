[0:17:42] canatica: what do you do in your days off @Cowsep
[0:17:52] phillmccrackenn: whats your full build for yi
[0:17:54] rocketfingers01: !rank
[0:17:54] StreamElements: Cowsep is currently playing on: http://op.gg/summoners/kr/%EB%A7%9D%EA%B3%A0%EB%94%B8%EA%B8%B0%ED%8F%AC%EB%8F%84 He also has a Master+ account: http://op.gg/summoners/kr/cowsep (Grandmaster ladder update in:  10 hours 50 mins).
[0:17:57] phillmccrackenn: do u build hydra?
[0:18:18] Blam____: You deserve a sub gift anyhow to make up for the lack of power you receive from the cow mantle.
[0:18:31] empressgardens: what programming language? java?
[0:18:57] lastdivebender: nice 600g
[0:19:06] Blam____: People love to talk to this man about programming.
[0:19:23] phillmccrackenn: thats the first time i seen a kassadin player
[0:19:26] Blam____: You should be incahoots with Piratesoftware
[0:20:03] lastdivebender: scripts
[0:20:03] ACR_kakashi: hello baldsep
[0:20:06] canatica: I thought only C++ and C had memory leaks @Cowsep
[0:20:12] tunaloaf1: @cowsep are you dropping frames or is that me?
[0:20:13] Blam____: His dad worked for bliz. So, nepotism
[0:20:21] Blam____: piratesoftware
[0:20:46] Jinmuu: @canatica Any language can have memory leaks, its just when you allocate memory and forget to deallocate it. Even Languages like C# can leak memory.
[0:20:46] yuiitsunok: what is that thing that shows up on the right side of the screen, how can I get that in league ?
[0:21:15] canatica: @Jinmuu but they have garbage collection to dellocate it for you tho
[0:21:25] Blam____: good question; thats some 3rd party stuff
[0:22:02] phillmccrackenn: gg
[0:22:19] Jinmuu: @canatica There'sthe unsafe keyword, and if you load a C++ executable and call a function that has a leak problem it can leak from there too. TONS of ways it leaks. Only the memory managed directly by the C# runtime is GC'd.
[0:22:42] phillmccrackenn: if u win this game i will look at my games differently
[0:22:47] Ryden7: @canatica It does unless u really don't know what ur doing
[0:22:50] Jinmuu: @yuiitsunok Porofessor
[0:23:25] dantrat: Is cowsep a software developer?
[0:23:46] Jinmuu: @Ryden7 Sometimes you dont have a choice, I had to work around many memory problems at previous jobs because they wanted to use expensive out of date libraries and link them into new software.
[0:23:48] canatica: @Ryden7 ive been working as a java developer for 8 years and never had to fix a memory leak bug in my life
[0:24:15] Hysaken: !rank
[0:24:15] Jinmuu: @canatica I weep for your life, Java SUCKS
[0:24:15] StreamElements: Cowsep is currently playing on: http://op.gg/summoners/kr/%EB%A7%9D%EA%B3%A0%EB%94%B8%EA%B8%B0%ED%8F%AC%EB%8F%84 He also has a Master+ account: http://op.gg/summoners/kr/cowsep (Grandmaster ladder update in:  10 hours 43 mins).
[0:24:29] AhnkPaulah: yoink
[0:24:35] canatica: @Jinmuu i love it
[0:24:46] lastdivebender: wits
[0:25:01] Jinmuu: I'm also willing to bet you had memory issues and didnt realize it because Java is subjected to the same problems if you have to load third party libraries or have to load unmanaged code.
[0:25:17] Ryden7: @Jinmuu Only time Ive heard of this was when someone was misusing locks. Which libraries did u use?
[0:25:22] Jinmuu: Not all memory leaks can become huge problems, some companies ignore them.
[0:25:41] phillmccrackenn: is this NA?
[0:25:51] Blam____: @cowsep bro try Logitech G502 X PLUS i shit you not its beutiful. use it on a hard mousepad they also provide
[0:26:25] ChaveChaveChave: I have a g502x right now. Works well
[0:26:46] Blam____: G903 Lightspeed and PRO Wireless Gaming Mice, Cloth or Hard Gaming Mouse Pad
[0:26:46] phillmccrackenn: thts a nice mouse
[0:26:49] Thami2K: ??
[0:26:51] Jinmuu: @Ryden7 Old C libraries made in the 90's before even C99 by programmers who had retired before I even got hired. They were wonderful to work with and we didnt even have the full source to modify it :)
[0:26:52] Blam____: go for that combo then
[0:27:03] Blam____: choose hard
[0:27:07] phillmccrackenn: whats the best mouse for league
[0:27:10] AboodAliy: COWWSEP
[0:27:41] Ryden7: @Jinmuu If you're coding in C or C++, my condolences
[0:27:47] diramude: diramude subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! hi
[0:28:10] CaptainAmeric0: Yooo X what's good everyone
[0:28:14] Blam____: at least get the mouse. anyway im out ily
[0:28:36] Jinmuu: @Ryden7 I code mostly in Typescript or my own language I made called InfinityLang these days. Although I do work with C++, with the new C++14 memory libraries things are WAY better.
[0:28:58] AhnkPaulah: @phillmccrackenn Nothing like my $2 Genius XScroll black

[0:30:29] canatica: prefence tho
[0:30:42] clotisback: that headset dent is crazy
[0:31:48] Ryden7: Interesting. Whats your background? I wish I was better at C++ but pretty impratical these days except embedded
[0:32:11] canatica: @Ryden7 C++ is getting completetly replaced by RUST
[0:32:33] Jinmuu: @Ryden7 I've been coding for 20+ years at this point I've worked in soooooooo many different companies over the years.
[0:32:50] Jinmuu: @canatica Nah, RUST is great but it's too opinionated and many developers dont like that.
[0:32:55] brunchmenus: ban akali play jax Kappa
[0:32:57] OpaqueColours: do you think with the ample amount of champs that are in the game now, each person should get 2 bans? @Cowsep
[0:33:16] jakiekaxe: midbeast gonna look like cowsep next month
[0:33:22] jakiekaxe: midbMald
[0:34:07] Jinmuu: @Cowsep When you get a spare second check that video I DM'd you. Crazy stuff.
[0:34:52] Jinmuu: Well, probably any kind of grevious beats it but it was interesting.
[0:34:52] zuccsucc: how many times per week do u beat off?
[0:35:13] dngrspapercut: i was never able to put my finger on it. but now i know why cowsep is so good. his map awareness is insane because he always has 1 eye locked in on the mini map while the other one can focus on the main screen
[0:35:14] lol_player2018: Been away for a while, no more hat?
[0:36:15] kwellxD: grimoire with that 30% auto cast for the wand your are not using its such a valuable combo
[0:36:39] zuccsucc: i shit my pants
[0:37:06] Jinmuu: @lol_player2018 He's just giving it a rest for now he still wears it most times.
[0:37:30] lol_player2018: Good to hear it's an awesome hat

[1:14:17] mrallgood: cant believe how good the bald looks
[1:14:35] phillmccrackenn: actual 5head
[1:14:39] WarwickBasado: Cowsep what do u think about the runaans changes? it now applies impact effects so in champs like Yi it would stack the passive every time he hit 3 targets and plus reduce Q 3 seconds instead 1, its like navori + guinsoo in 1 single item
[1:14:56] lucilifer12: what up cow! say it back panicBasket @cowsep
[1:14:57] solidtwo: @mrallgood looks clean with the beard

[1:17:02] xyznome: Do you still thin darkharvest lethality yi is good?
[1:17:20] スカサハ: guinsoos can be prestacked before a fight tho
[1:17:27] butterbutsad: i think terminus dmg only includes the on hit
[1:17:39] スカサハ: It's the one redeeming factor for guinsoos over terminus imo
[1:18:32] WarwickBasado: have u tried Hexperimental with Yi ? R cdr and 30% AS when uses ultimate
[1:18:44] スカサハ: I think it tracks post mitigation damage so technically it does factor in pen but only for the 30 onhit damage ig
[1:18:47] phillmccrackenn: this is filpino server?
[1:18:54] heyitsthatdude2: Mr.Cowsep sir what do you think of the T1 vs KT match that will start in 1 hr? @cowsep
[1:20:00] Joltaire: Please please try Runaan's + Navori next game
[1:20:12] スカサハ: Oh yeah easy solution just build both no argument there xd
[1:20:25] heyitsthatdude2: Do u think you will Costream the LCK i think your feedback would be so insightfull
[1:20:33] WarwickBasado: @Joltaire it dont work because runaans dont apply the effect of reduction cooldowns, not yet, but in next patch it will

[1:43:15] xxcaptspazxx: I heard the shorter your hair, the bigger your pp
[1:43:24] XDa31: I saw a football player do hair prosthesis it was legit
[1:43:30] diramude: you could be the new rogaine sponsor
[1:43:38] PhilXaphas: think about all the haircuts you're saving on - I'm balding too and I think we should embrace it (btw 1 in 10 women face pattern baldness too we could support them too)
[1:43:40] efeffefefef2134: use your butt hairs

[1:44:51] diramude: yeah you were mowing her down real good cowGasm
[1:45:26] seyphyrus: @onestepstroke It’s a really touchy subject with him. He hates it for me to see him bald. =/

[1:49:13] seyphyrus: @onestepstroke It’s not that I care or not. it’s the fact that he doesn’t feel safe for me to see him like that. So it kind of means that he doesn’t feel “secure” with me.
[1:49:23] pisasoleil: Id ask destiny about how he did his Website

[3:52:34] Rjz3: @Cowsep if i gather all your accounts mastery on Yi do you think you above 10mil ?
[3:52:37] sezo_31ciogullari: why dont u rush hydra
[3:52:38] DroppinEggs: @sezo_31ciogullari not to everyone
[3:53:03] woolfook: @Rjz3 above 69 million probably
[3:53:18] kikmen118: @cowsep Toughts on new MSI monitors that will fuk up league?
[3:53:25] woolfook: senna was 1 strike away

[3:53:55] impaktfull: lmao
[3:53:56] t1deadlyy: Hmm brok as first item look weak
[3:54:08] sezo_31ciogullari: mistakes were made
[3:54:13] t1deadlyy: Might be still craken or hydra as first item
[3:54:36] kikmen118: They will have a AI in them that will show you where enemies are coming from even when you have no vision of them
[3:54:44] diramude: Titanic good 2nd or 3rd?
[3:55:07] Fathai95: isnt that like a 5k -10k monitor tho kikmen118
[3:55:56] sadrack96: oh nice you have the hat off
[3:56:00] sadrack96: you look good bro
[3:56:08] kikmen118: Dont know the price but big streamers that play league got money for them tho @fathai95
[3:56:27] kikmen118: And kids with their parents money
[3:57:10] Fathai95: honestly thats the gaming industry's problem as a whole
[3:57:15] StreamElements: Want to chat about Master Yi, share your clips or get notifications when Cowsep goes live? Join the discord https://discord.gg/cowsep
[3:57:26] Fathai95: we cant do anything about it
[3:58:01] kikmen118: Nop,and no anicheat can do anything about it cuz its a monitor not a pc component so it wont detect it
[3:58:24] theultimatejaxsenpai: jax LUL
[3:58:28] kikmen118: Today its league tomorrow will be other games that will get ruined by ai monitors
[3:58:41] Fathai95: they'll probably introduce some hardware recognition programs to target those monitor
[3:58:49] bigmose88: Senna not balanced
[3:59:14] DestinyCallsYou: your looking good dude, i dont play league anymore just saying hi
[3:59:15] zed2232: lul
[3:59:18] zed2232: LUL
[3:59:19] Rjz3: that jax was 1500lp last season TF
[3:59:27] kikmen118: They barely have anticheat that works,doubt they will get anything for those monitors any time soon
[3:59:27] BongoBongs: baldsep
[3:59:32] BMTMike: yeah the monitor makes all the calculations. it wont be detected
[3:59:54] captnkr0n1c: why no kraken? it feels so good when I rush it
[4:00:00] DestinyCallsYou: wuju style
[4:00:01] kikmen118: Also it has ai in it so it will probably be able to "hide itselfe"
[4:00:55] Fathai95: nah it'd still have a serial number/model number
[4:01:03] kikmen118: Soon all games will be pay to win
[4:01:35] kikmen118: Yeah but it wont be able to do anything about it
[4:01:45] UltraviolentAce: Imagine hurricane in that tf resting q
[4:01:47] t1deadlyy: Sad how all of them use the flash when you are trying a play
[4:01:50] t1deadlyy: Meh
[4:02:11] impaktfull: jax counters yi yep?
[4:02:15] Fathai95: gaming companies might tell MSI to compromise
[4:02:17] kikmen118: Pc components bans work diffrent,monitor is independent of pc
[4:02:30] Fathai95: and tell them to turn off the AI in their game
[4:02:47] Fathai95: its AI, its aint nothing really fancy
[4:02:52] kikmen118: You think they will accept it when they can get loads of money off of sales
[4:03:06] Fathai95: i mean then companies can just block the game from running
[4:03:40] Fathai95: so instead of an anticheat blocking "cheat programs", these anti cheat will block "cheat hardware"
[4:03:47] kikmen118: So league is screwd then xD in near future
[4:03:56] Fathai95: it all come down to if companies want to compromise or not
[4:04:02] Donoz99: Morning @Cowsep  have u tried deep rock galactic survivor? kinda same idea as this game
[4:04:53] kikmen118: They might just join msi and do their own monitors like that so,thats what i think will happen
[4:05:23] vickraj_anthonippillai: show food @cowsep
[4:05:56] vickraj_anthonippillai: why do you have an angry bird nose @cowsep
[4:06:26] LokiTheHarvester: @kikmen118 what like you would have to have a league monitor to play league?
[4:06:32] stasisguy: its like a ryze build Kappa
[4:06:58] Fathai95: @cowsep look at the black one coming out to know which one is real
[4:07:04] Fathai95: i just noticed it the other day OMEGALUL
[4:07:42] kikmen118: @lokitheharvester nah,they made a monitor that basicly gives you cheats in league
[4:07:43] Fathai95: snip snip
[4:07:45] StreamElements: If you want those fancy map timers or just to win overall more games try out porofessor for free now using my link: https://links.overwolf.com/cowsep_porofessor
[4:07:54] LokiTheHarvester: lol
[4:08:28] sortadam: what happend to your hair broooo
[4:08:42] kikmen118: @lokitheharvester  and anticheat cant do anything about it cuz its a ai in monitor not a softwere
[4:09:13] kikmen118: @lokitheharvester look up msi ai monitors you will see everything about how stupidly op they are in league
[4:09:22] LokiTheHarvester: what does it do?
[4:09:22] cutout1: Played vs a 2.5M mastery cass top main twice today, kinda annoying
[4:10:02] kikmen118: @lokitheharvester  it will display a enemy icon from direction they are coming towards you even tho you dont have vision of them
[4:10:12] escapeddog: 420
