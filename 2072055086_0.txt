[2:05:18] karnageXp: Drinks you say...do tell
[2:05:27] Shinstin: lucian hurts wtf
[2:05:46] cbhl: Archathens ok but that's how everybody cooked until the late 1900s because it was only then that people could afford mass-produced measuring utensils
[2:06:02] Archathens: exactly, we just need a modern version of it
[2:06:06] neocas: Recipe for a great morning: wake up, see Yvonne streaming League with Balls and after 1 game she wants to cook
