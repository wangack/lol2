[2:04:17] bladetrinity16: not yet
[2:04:18] Life_Forms: i have been playing Shen when the enemy team picks TF, just ult when he ults
[2:04:20] twinkothy: tfs stun lasts so long for being point and click...

[2:05:11] Quantum: hi woolly <3
[2:05:18] Senyuno: ohnoquantumishere
[2:05:20] aJaskar: @som963 Because they nerfed AP on Tf and took 5dmg off of Maokai (Hurting his top lane prio)
[2:05:21] Quantum: SEN :3
[2:05:39] yamyam_x: seraphine eating dinner rn
[2:05:45] som963: @aJaskar sadge

[2:05:47] bladetrinity16: BIG
[2:05:51] mushymoss: hufee
[2:05:51] jannablowsu: ohnoquantumishere
[2:05:57] bladetrinity16: @ThomasTheTwink irelia -5ms
[2:06:07] MissJenella: I remember when maokai was super unpopular until they made his ult move faster or something last year ish
[2:06:07] Quantum: janna :3
[2:06:12] Kinkou_Order: @ThomasTheTwink maybe valid, but talking about other streamers is bad (can be ok sometimes) especially if its bad talking one
[2:06:14] voidmoons: right jenella
[2:06:20] voidmoons: now suddenly hes a god
[2:06:29] jannablowsu: nick i finally got all my lp i lost earler this season lmao
[2:06:30] Jakmo: @MissJenella I always liked Maokai Sadge
[2:06:30] jimmyxflare: almost how a script would HmmCouncil
[2:06:43] MissJenella: oh I always liked maokai too don't get me wrong :3
[2:06:43] vogue_hommes: karma monkaS
[2:06:44] Jakmo: it feels bad playing one of my favorites and getting flamed for using "op champs"
[2:06:47] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[2:06:48] MissJenella: he just wasn't played that often
[2:06:57] twinkothy: kaceyWendy
[2:07:07] vegandiamond: uuh
[2:07:11] bladetrinity16: Erm
[2:07:18] ThomasTheTwink: kaceyWendy
[2:07:30] Kinkou_Order: @Jakmo i got called a meta abuser for playing shen top (tbf he was good but i am an otp) by a yas top
[2:07:31] Jakmo: I like when a champ I play a lot is strong but unpopular. then I get to seem like I'm not a metaslave ok
[2:07:32] AllOfGenius: i miss ap maokai supp :( brain off, sapling go
[2:07:33] bladetrinity16: to be fair his ult moving faster gave him jungle strength, support has only really come back this season cause of the items
[2:07:54] ThomasTheTwink: @WholesomeHyena_ i think u can just ignore anything a yasuo says hehe
[2:07:54] Kinkou_Order: oh he called me a mata slave not abuser
[2:08:09] bladetrinity16: how dare you abuse a former world champion D:
[2:08:32] Hykeir: isn't it better to go barrier here?
[2:08:34] Kinkou_Order: shen is yasuo tops worst matchup *probably*
[2:08:34] Jakmo: @WholesomeHyena_ that's sad, happens a lot. a lot of my favorites have the same effect
[2:08:36] BaneBladeV: it's ok tf does 300 per auto this early
[2:09:09] bladetrinity16: @WholesomeHyena_ gnar
[2:09:16] ThomasTheTwink: isnt it malphite
[2:09:18] bladetrinity16: or what is that the other way around
[2:09:34] Jakmo: Yasuo can do pretty well into Malphite early and get ahead, so not really
[2:09:43] Jakmo: longterm sure
[2:09:51] bladetrinity16: also isnt most tops counter ksante
[2:10:00] Kinkou_Order: ok maybe not the WORST but what i ment is shen doesnt need to be good at the game to crush yas
[2:10:02] scarletarchangel: when support should roam any lane?
[2:10:05] mushymoss: niice
[2:10:09] ThomasTheTwink: oml they are rework/nerfing ksante again
[2:10:10] BaneBladeV: capySlay
[2:10:12] kebimbimbab: she was too ez
[2:10:16] AllOfGenius: she misses u too :(
[2:10:17] kebimbimbab: you wanted to play yourself
[2:10:34] Kinkou_Order: stunt should be a playable league champ
[2:10:36] Jakmo: I played Sion top because I got a cool skin (as a jung/mid player) for the first time in 3+ years. I was counterpicked by Shen and hated my life Madge
[2:10:38] yamyam_x: grubs sounds funny odd name
[2:10:40] bladetrinity16: @ThomasTheTwink at this point hes worse than yuumi
[2:10:51] Kinkou_Order: @Jakmo today?
[2:10:53] BaneBladeV: I think they fixed it so mites don't give stacks to infinitely stacking champs
[2:10:58] Jakmo: @WholesomeHyena_ a week ago I think
[2:10:59] ThomasTheTwink: stunt should be the manly ranged enchanter
[2:10:59] azhaiasiam: Grubbin
[2:11:02] ThomasTheTwink: that they refuse to make
[2:11:14] azhaiasiam: I love death cab
[2:11:15] bladetrinity16: give braum a bow
[2:11:25] Kinkou_Order: @stunt if you were a league champ what would your kit be
[2:11:25] azhaiasiam: Ben ghibbard
[2:12:05] jjemei: this is Postal Service i think
[2:12:07] Jakmo: @WholesomeHyena_ did you play Shen against a Sion today and think it was me? lol
[2:12:30] Kinkou_Order: lol maybe
[2:12:34] azhaiasiam: Omg you know the postal service?  It's a duo project with Ben and
[2:12:42] DaDaggerFace: hurricane would have popped off there... thats all im saying Kappa
[2:12:46] kebimbimbab: the flash mantra q no...
[2:12:53] azhaiasiam: Jimmy tamberwlo
[2:12:55] Jakmo: @WholesomeHyena_ then it wasn't me, but I'm sure I played it horribly. Is Shen really good against Sion top?
[2:12:59] jjemei: ya i'm surprised to hear it i never hear anyone listening to them
[2:13:02] azhaiasiam: Tamberelo
[2:13:24] BaneBladeV: tomatoes saoriAYAYA
[2:13:28] PharmDRPh: widepeepoHappy
[2:13:32] azhaiasiam: Tomatos
[2:13:40] azhaiasiam: <3
[2:13:44] Kinkou_Order: @Jakmo i dont know most data matchups, but in my experience it is a snowbally skilled matchup, whoever is better even if by a little will crush
[2:13:58] Jere24cm: is senna good blindpick
[2:14:16] som963: song?
[2:14:30] bladetrinity16: @WholesomeHyena_ imo match up is on sion to snowball against a shen
[2:14:31] Jakmo: @WholesomeHyena_ that's fair. This guy was a Shen otp and top main. I don't play top or Sion. I kept getting canceled on my Q even though I released super early for his taunt. Was a frustrating game
[2:14:39] vegandiamond: why'd they name it hubris
[2:14:55] BaneBladeV: because you have statues of yourself
[2:15:05] Kinkou_Order: @vegandiamond you build a statue of yourself for every kill
[2:15:13] vegandiamond: ohhh
[2:15:25] Jakmo: You gain AD when you make a kill, in the sense that you get puffed up with pride after defeating someone else. That's the theme
[2:17:33] ThomasTheTwink: smite is fake this patch
[2:17:42] AllOfGenius: he used smite on tf kill lmao
[2:17:50] ThomasTheTwink: its just jungle propaganda
[2:17:53] AllOfGenius: the autofill is showing
[2:18:30] azhaiasiam: cheerleader
[2:18:35] vegandiamond: do you guys like this song
[2:18:56] BaneBladeV: that thicc seraph shield
[2:19:02] ThomasTheTwink: i dont hate it @vegandiamond

[2:19:30] Hykeir: EZ
[2:19:33] kebimbimbab: i would have said to recall

[2:20:00] ThomasTheTwink: all dead go Nessie irl
[2:20:00] azhaiasiam: why qss?
[2:20:15] archimedes_9: Nessie
[2:20:22] pistol_pew_pew: Hi Stunt, I was watching Keria vod rn and after every reset he goes to mid lane to push the wave for his Taliyah. Do you think it is because Taliyah is roaming champion and that's why he can push out her wave or it's good thing to do in general?
[2:20:22] azhaiasiam: mayo man?
[2:20:26] ThomasTheTwink: omHi archi meandyou

[2:29:28] bladetrinity16: whats a worse adaptation, eragon or avatar movie
[2:29:30] Jakmo: I love everyone staring at them warming up their bending
[2:29:32] ThomasTheTwink: i just peel and he smolds at him
[2:29:36] azhaiasiam: pajama soraka is best skin
[2:29:37] peepoWeird: malphite walking around the rift is more earth-bendy than that scene.
[2:29:38] Telperion16: The martial arts on that group is so energetic and then one small rock slowly moves into frame OMEGALUL
[2:29:45] mushymoss: @bladetrinity16 eragon fs it was soooo ugly
[2:29:52] ThomasTheTwink: @bladetrinity16 i forgot ther was a eragon movie

[2:30:03] bladetrinity16: im hopeful for the eragon series coming
[2:30:05] kebimbimbab: then everyone dies
[2:30:06] Glosssea: fire was op cause it didnt need a source early on
[2:30:14] Hook123: Fire bending has the higher skill ceiling
[2:30:17] Jakmo: Earthbending can be the most powerful. Just slurp your opponent into the ground
[2:30:19] azhaiasiam: water + fire = air...
[2:30:21] ThomasTheTwink: i read all the books as a young lad
[2:30:25] ThomasTheTwink: of eragon
[2:30:26] Telperion16: Earth benders can bend uranium so BOOM nuclear weapons
[2:30:26] mushymoss: imagine if they did eragon game of thrones style
[2:30:29] bladetrinity16: @Jakmo air, just pull the oxygen out of their lungs
[2:30:29] woollywispy: it’s so nostalgic though. it might not be a good movie but it’s a childhood core memory
[2:30:33] Hykeir: would air benders would be able to bend all forms of gas
[2:30:48] archimedes_9: Gas Erm
[2:30:50] Telperion16: D: mustard gas bending
[2:30:51] shintoaliengod: yeah, take out all the oxygen from ones body Aware
[2:30:53] Jakmo: @bladetrinity16 that takes at least 10-15 seconds to beat someone. You can be underground and crushed by then and breathe after
[2:30:54] azhaiasiam: is this army of anyone? the blink alt band?
[2:30:58] kebimbimbab: what type of gas
[2:31:02] kebimbimbab: go on

[4:30:58] Lazynameross: SadgeCry no more capsules
[4:30:59] avuloseunda: @missjenella yess
[4:31:00] areallystalememe: morg doesn’t seem like a real pick
[4:31:10] MissJenella: morg is such a sad champion..
[4:31:44] avuloseunda: Morgs entire kit is based on her Q :( and its so easy to dodge too
[4:31:54] MissJenella: she used to be one of my mains mid
[4:32:10] avuloseunda: Lux and neeko can still damage with other spelle but morg other spels do no damage :(
[4:32:14] Jakmo: @avuloseunda Blitz gets the same range and a full pull of cc but Morg's is super slow
[4:32:45] avuloseunda: @jakmo yeah but he's tanky so he can run in. :( if morg misses we have to run
[4:32:51] Jakmo: I am NOT advocating that Morg Q should be Blitz Q fast, but still
[4:33:09] areallystalememe: you have to hit so many qs to make morg worth it. it’s difficult to make it work
[4:33:12] Lazynameross: its been ages since ive played morg on sr but i just went tank with her
[4:33:12] MissJenella: yea and tormented shadow dmg so reliant on your binding to keep them in it lol
[4:33:28] Lazynameross: no point in stuff like zhonya if enemy can just run
[4:33:32] Jakmo: I wonder if the days of Rylai's rush Morg for W slow into Qs will ever come back
[4:33:36] MissJenella: she can be a pretty ok jungler tho
[4:33:38] MissJenella: but ew jungle
[4:33:48] Razieleron: If you hold q it should pass through minions
[4:33:54] Thommenius: most likely very common in lower elos where adcs cant dodge or stay behind minions
[4:33:57] Balldropper: morg spellshield can be kinda good tho. like if u have a hypercarry twitch just shield him he comes at an off angle and cleans house
[4:34:20] Jakmo: @Balldropper but others like Yuumi and Janna just do that better now Sadge
[4:34:21] vro1v9: is this new patch
[4:34:37] Hook123: wow rene breaks the shield and stuns them too thats crazy
[4:34:52] Balldropper: erm I dont like yummi
[4:35:03] Balldropper: janna tho is <3
[4:35:22] MissJenella: I might try going roa liandry's morg mid again
[4:35:50] Jakmo: @MissJenella did you ever do Tear/RoA/Liandry's/Dcap Morg mid?
[4:35:51] MissJenella: i used to play that a bit before glacial build my love
[4:35:51] ejhavok: @MissJenella ooh invoking the old magics
[4:36:06] MissJenella: I don't think you need that much mana
[4:36:17] MissJenella: i mean i guess for seraph's shield is nice
[4:36:30] MissJenella: @ejhavok yasss
[4:36:32] Jakmo: she was basically unkillable with Seraph's shield and couldn't be removed from the map. that was the point. just curious
[4:36:47] MissJenella: yea I never tried it with seraphs but everything else I have haha
[4:36:54] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis

[4:43:22] Frankblijleven: ye thats what he said, makes no sense

[4:44:49] Zinklot: Smolder support?
[4:45:14] Balldropper: dongerj Looking up at Smolder's MOM
[4:45:17] Jakmo: having a top ban in his spot helps though
[4:45:45] ejhavok: i rarely feel like I need the biscuits on supp smoldie
[4:45:50] avuloseunda: What if we could zoom out a lot and find put thst smolders mom is shyvana
