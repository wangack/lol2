[3:04:19] cereal420x3: @jonnylurks I mean the more common tourist things, london eye, certain museums, even food in some places is way more
[3:04:22] league_of_d3pression: @serverlord in the nicest way possible, I ain't missing out keep that away from me 🤣🤣🤣 I'm happy with Nutella on toast.
[3:04:43] cereal420x3: Cheese on crackers with HP brown sauce is where it's at
[3:04:50] jonnylurks: @cereal420x3 true but i think skygarden is nicer than london eye etc
