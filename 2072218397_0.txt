[3:24:23] surfininsand: do ur balls smell?
[3:24:26] Vuosta: @JamesAcky i mean to be fair that signing was before the allegations right? Kick is scummy because its an advertising agency for a gambling site
[3:24:38] MrTvern: xdding
[3:25:03] Vezibtwww: back on the rift i see YEP
[3:25:26] Vuosta: garen champion doing work
[3:25:33] nctssd: fat bot wave

[3:26:17] Luumuwu: I finished baldur's gate a few days ago highly recommend
[3:26:40] Vuosta: @JamesAcky fair enough mate
[3:26:49] JamesAcky: although I‚Äôm sure people like adin Ross are well educated in the word consent
[3:26:58] shadowsapiens: lool
[3:27:01] JayTac: KEKW this smolder
[3:27:10] kehsire: Starting to get the feeling this Smolder might not be the MVP
[3:27:25] Scotterif: Lucien! does he have the staff of armadyl!
[3:27:28] shadowsapiens: lol the vel koz name
[3:27:29] Spyder_Phenom: invest in more control wards :)
[3:27:32] Vuosta: @Sick_Nerd mate its the frozen heart angle

[3:27:54] shadowsapiens: more dmg blow him up
[3:27:56] shadowsapiens: EZ
[3:27:56] JayTac: @MRGOODLIVING killing minions with q or hitting champs with abilities
[3:28:01] Brovack: gm adam <3
[3:28:08] klatterbox: unmute chat wawa
[3:28:16] IDazza69: smolder wont even be max stacks even in a 1 hour game
[3:28:20] Vuosta: hes 100 stacks off jesus
[3:28:30] meatfeastsub: how does smolder get stacks and what do they do?
[3:29:02] Vuosta: @meatfeastsub he cses with Q or some shit and they make his champ good
[3:29:29] sparkyman: xdd
[3:29:33] LuckyAss420: hes also not building shojin
[3:29:33] JayTac: testing out the new smolder bot in your ranked game
[3:29:36] LuckyAss420: so def a troll
[3:29:44] narnsberg: @meatfeastsub Killing minions with Q or hitting champs with Q. Makes his Q stronger at certain checkpoints. 225 stacks is the goal
[3:29:53] StreamElements: If you want to know when I'm streaming, I'll send out a stream notification via twitter https://twitter.com/Sick_Nerd
[3:29:53] IDazza69: i believe its Q hits on champs and Q kills for minions etc and his Q gets empowered to become AOE and then it applies burn then it has a 5 % execute
[3:30:14] Vuosta: pretty sure you can run through their entire team with kaenic + frozen heart
[3:30:17] nick0792: DogO

[3:31:39] tmm72: Never 50 50 a baron especially against eve
[3:31:40] ducksayqwak: hopefully
[3:31:40] narnsberg: @Tramfix Kha beats Ekko. Nunu beats them all
[3:31:45] shadowsapiens: have you heard who the fastest jungle clearer is now?
[3:31:59] shadowsapiens: zyra
[3:32:17] Tramfix: @narnsberg Ekko smite is a bit very very impossible but applying third stack with e and smite at the same time does well more than nunu q smite
[3:32:27] Vuosta: thats kinda cool i might play that, zyra is fun but being at the mercy of a lane partner is so lame
[3:32:27] surfininsand: where u going?
[3:33:17] wrehwrehwreh: hey kind how r u ?
[3:33:46] Rellies: 0/11 nodd
