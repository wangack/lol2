[1:24:30] poopydiarrhea1: Doesnt good ol Jerry own FaZe now?
[1:24:43] 3usterFN: mythic is good to retake high ground. you can shoot up and switch to pump instant.
[1:24:55] Tolkien_Bullet: @Buildmanbob did that kid managed to advance in FNCS?
[1:25:03] Tolkien_Bullet: the*
[1:25:06] Buildmanbob: @tolkien_bullet what kid
[1:25:13] eorlando2326: so how does that work?
[1:25:14] Tolkien_Bullet: Moongraal
[1:25:19] poopydiarrhea1: Whos winning FNCS tonight?
[1:25:24] Buildmanbob: mongraal n savage got to grands yeah
[1:25:27] 3usterFN: you might have to bust out the renegade raider bro
[1:25:35] Buildmanbob: they wont place high tho
[1:26:04] poopydiarrhea1: Nate and Funk wouldve won FNCS if they played
[1:26:30] steve_fuller: @poopydiarrhea1 idk
[1:26:33] Buildmanbob: who you got pred top 3 today
[1:26:35] Tolkien_Bullet: @Buildmanbob oh i had no ideia
[1:26:53] eorlando2326: true where the heck is he at?
[1:27:01] poopydiarrhea1: @steve_fuller gotta believe
[1:27:19] sentiir: Mongraal and Savage have the most scuffed drop ever
[1:27:35] Buildmanbob: @sentiir theyre just shit is all
[1:27:36] fee_fi_fofo: cawfee
[1:27:58] purpleflower: @fee_fi_fofo are you okay today? natehillPetthesophie
[1:27:58] Tolkien_Bullet: @sentiir i saw like 2/3 games,and twice they died off spawn -.-
[1:28:02] 3usterFN: remember that tournament you played with NFL players or whatever
[1:28:16] fee_fi_fofo: @purpleflower i'm tired but still kicking lol
[1:28:23] JooseyJoose: Scoots
[1:28:39] Lady_Britt_: Pure muscle natehillFlex
[1:28:42] PDG__Assassin77: Joosey Scoots
[1:28:47] lonnixx6: Savages not gonna change drop
[1:28:48] fee_fi_fofo: god thats what my dad used to say when we were kid
[1:28:51] JooseyJoose: PDG Scoots
[1:28:52] eorlando2326: it’s savage he will never change it… he did the same when tilted was up
[1:28:55] ShaeLeeAnn: joosey natehillMom
[1:28:58] Lady_Britt_: Joose habitatHelga
[1:28:58] Tavarus02000: oh wow! arm was goated !
[1:29:03] JooseyJoose: Shae natehillMom
[1:29:10] sentiir: @buildmanbob nah they are fantastic when they get off spawn. I mean they literally won noble elite scrims, and the one time they got out of early game they done well. Savage is arguably best IGL on EU and Graal has crazy aim. I think they have all the skill necessary to win tbh, they are just quadconned
[1:29:13] JooseyJoose: Britt rubenf7CheekClaps
[1:29:31] 3usterFN: 0 ping is crazy
[1:29:57] nasty_flam3: Nate=Best Man
[1:30:00] 3usterFN: who’s your internet provider? you have fiber optic?
[1:30:16] Tolkien_Bullet: i dream with "single-digit" ping xD
[1:30:18] Buildmanbob: @sentiir theyre not fantastic in any way, not t1 at all
[1:30:29] Buildmanbob: savage might be but not with mongraal
[1:30:36] lonnixx6: @sentiir agreed, and the shouldn't have used 4 gam s to 50/50 that too chest
[1:30:43] Tolkien_Bullet: @sentiir these new blood will eat them ALIVE
[1:30:55] 3usterFN: your neighborhood doesn’t offer Verizon fios?
[1:31:02] Buildmanbob: savage is not anywhere close to best igl
[1:31:27] Tolkien_Bullet: @Buildmanbob fa c t
[1:31:38] Lady_Britt_: natehillLata
[1:31:43] Lady_Britt_: Woooo
[1:31:50] sentiir: Nah Graal is tier 1 again fs. Best at getting surge on the region and crazy aim, which is a way bigger deal in laggy grands lobbies. He solo clutched 7th today while getting 2 kills in the process
[1:31:55] 3usterFN: spectrum at 50mbs is one of your biggest issues with this game bro. especially how fast pace it is now.
[1:32:06] 3usterFN: that explains a lot
[1:32:14] aka_jayj: heyyy
[1:32:21] Buildmanbob: @sentiir 2 kills is laughable, he is so bad im sorry one clutch 7th is not good bro
[1:32:22] 3usterFN: that wall almost didn’t want to reset
[1:32:35] sentiir: @lonnixx6 yeah that chest sucks. I feel like they should drop Reckless and just split it with Jannisz because he is unconned there fr
[1:32:37] Buildmanbob: istg i hope youre trolling sentir
[1:32:58] sentiir: @buildmanbob I would like to see you get one kill as a solo in a duo grands lobby…
[1:33:00] pawpawjedith: no shame in a blank
[1:33:16] Buildmanbob: @sentiir when did i say i would buddy, ive never seen glazing this hard
[1:33:16] JooseyJoose: not the worst thing if a dude shoots blanks Kappa
[1:33:25] Tolkien_Bullet: @pawpawjedith ...at a certain age ,i mean xD
[1:33:46] DoodLetsGame: Pow got EM
[1:33:58] Nightbot: Sub to my youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgD5R9OyFkDk59LhghstZOQ?sub_confirmation=1
[1:34:05] sentiir: you said “two kills is so bad”… two kills as a solo duo in grands while clutching 40 placement points is crazy
[1:34:09] lonnixx6: @sentiir nah they should just have went for the guns on other floor as they did in the last two games, but the took that 50/50 for too many games
[1:34:28] PDG__Assassin77: nt
[1:34:28] Nightbot: nt nt
[1:34:31] Buildmanbob: @sentiir he only got 1 kill and its not crazy
[1:34:32] imjuniorrrr: wow
[1:34:33] nasty_flam3: @sentiir true though graal was crazy that last game
[1:34:33] DoodLetsGame: nt nt gg gg
[1:34:40] Lady_Britt_: nt
[1:34:43] nasty_flam3: Nate How'd Poker Go
[1:34:43] Buildmanbob: so many t1 pros did crazier clitches
[1:34:44] pawpawjedith: nt
[1:34:52] DoodLetsGame: lmao
[1:34:52] ItsMuus: what is ooze ??
[1:34:59] fee_fi_fofo: LUL
[1:35:00] JooseyJoose: HUH
[1:35:11] pawpawjedith: who’s fault is that??
[1:35:14] sentiir: Nah. And dont say pinq, pinqs clutch win was way less impressive as he was left alone with way less people left
[1:35:25] Lady_Britt_: DinoDance
[1:35:38] PDG__Assassin77: catJAM
[1:35:38] sentiir: I think any tier 1 pro or coach knows that Graal and Savage have the skill, its just whether they can do it when it matters, and their drop sucks
[1:36:03] Buildmanbob: @sentiir i cba bro, graal and savage are literally not close to ever placing high
[1:36:15] Buildmanbob: they suck im sorry
[1:36:28] badguise: u rootin for anybody tonight
[1:36:29] sentiir: Even if you had prime Veno and Queasy in Stark Split this season they aren’t placing top 30
[1:36:31] 3usterFN: do they not offer Verizon fios where you’re at?
[1:36:36] JooseyJoose: I could get down to Butter Barn rn
[1:36:39] sentiir: NA predic for me though is
[1:37:11] fee_fi_fofo: NODDERS
[1:37:14] JooseyJoose: Come on dahn to the Butter Baaaarn
[1:37:14] sentiir: Who do you think will win?
[1:37:30] 3usterFN: I think Blake is getting top 10 for sure
[1:37:33] badguise: yah it'd be cool if they popped off a little. i like watching reet play
[1:37:40] fee_fi_fofo: umm i can look
[1:37:42] nasty_flam3: probably
[1:37:56] 3usterFN: I think Aussie made one
[1:38:01] 3usterFN: you could check his twitter
[1:38:01] ttv_bestbryce: HI
[1:38:16] sentiir: There is a drop map on @NACompReport twitter with all teams
[1:38:18] fee_fi_fofo: lemme do some searching
