[3:08:18] Cottard__: @Staxelll i use it against riven, because they give free stacks by tanking with her shield
[3:08:20] Aldurfus: ipavNoted
[3:08:37] Staxelll: i usually perma ban riven
[3:08:44] Staxelll: but should i switch to banning someone else
[3:09:41] LtChezo: would you consider going ingenious hunter with hexplate?
[3:09:43] Cottard__: @Staxelll i personally think riven is easy match up, aatrox, akali, rumble are way worse
