[0:08:59] Lopseypop: KT Rolled ster
[0:09:06] arielleej: "war"
[0:09:06] fatalqwerty: How does Monte feel now that KT has fallen from grace?

[0:10:26] fatalqwerty: KT just went 0-2 vs HLE and SKT right after going 2-0 against GENG, they truly are the KT Rolsters
[0:10:39] Naxser: @MonteCristo  Gen.G should baned Senna also
[0:10:43] archie7497: If I remember correctly f0rest put something like 5+ bets on kills over on KT vs t1 and it didn't hit because the matches were complete stomps.
[0:11:19] Zizonyx: eavLurk

[0:12:46] Dreath1: This telecom "war" was a disgusting gap in every possible metric
[0:12:47] DankWizard420: all new champs are broken PepeLaugh
[0:12:50] stevethekind: how do you feel about the new champ sir monte
[0:12:57] Dreath1: those two games could've been an email
[0:13:02] Shobes572: @fatalqwerty can't be outright broken since he lost in a 50 minute game lol
[0:13:12] Thorgood2: viper slapped smolder though
[0:13:25] Phixos2: title for game 1 is: early game comp loses early game
[0:13:26] achillesreel: The first thing I thought after watching the telecom war was I can't wait to watch Monte lose his shit over this.
[0:13:35] Shobes572: Would definitely say very strong
[0:13:37] SSaVii: monte i can tell you now this isn't a banger
[0:13:37] itsame_martin: how valid do you interpret bro's win over kdf then?
[0:13:46] killerwhalekj: telecom massacre
[0:13:50] archie7497: It's funny how hwei and smolder are already picked in pro while nafiri and briar are still no where to be found
[0:14:08] cruckurjack: @MonteCristo why is senna so strong and such high prio?
[0:14:11] McDumps: @archie7497 Hey, Oner played Briar that one game, and it was awful.
[0:14:17] achillesreel: Telecom warcrimes.
[0:14:39] archie7497: @mcdumps you mean the exhibition match where he was literally int feeding?
[0:14:40] McDumps: @MonteCristo Is kKoma doing champ select now over tom?
[0:14:46] PinnxelGRP: can massacres be bangers
[0:14:49] McDumps: @archie7497 Was funny.
[0:15:13] SSaVii: T1 is just hands diff
[0:15:16] Dom__: It's amazing how it chose an early game comp and did literally nothing lol
[0:15:20] Dreath1: faker played this game well iirc he somehow went even
[0:15:21] Dom__: Kt
[0:16:01] Shimmerz: this match needs more than the fraud alert button
[0:16:12] Shimmerz: it needs a criminal investagation
[0:16:13] delakv1: hell yea more bangers only
[0:16:37] Lopseypop: KT's draft is just not good
[0:16:39] Shimmerz: primary engage alert incoming
[0:16:57] PinnxelGRP: kalista ult with renata no way
[0:17:10] fatalqwerty: Naut is just gonna bonk xin zhao when he comes in
[0:17:18] Lopseypop: Do they think they will engage with renata ult?
[0:17:21] Professional_Aellith: The unseen Handshake is the deadliest
[0:17:28] archie7497: But even if kt banned poppy. Isn't kalista karma udyr absolutely dogpiss damage wise?
[0:17:41] frostyfury09: feel like I have to ask why this match is on bangers only
[0:17:41] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:17:53] Saaajsu: counterengange no?
[0:17:57] Dreath1: renata ult engage is dogshit unless you flash over the wall from out of vision, and even then it's not guaranteed + you're down a flash
[0:18:09] PinnxelGRP: beryl tried engaging with it PepeLaugh youll see
[0:18:10] Shimmerz: this is on bangers only because kt is about to get banged
[0:18:22] McDumps: It seems like T1 will bait you and outsmart you.
[0:18:28] frostyfury09: @Shimmerz fuck thats good
[0:18:46] fatalqwerty: I actually think Aatrox is such a good pick against KT's draft coz they cant burst anyone mid-late game
[0:18:59] Shimmerz: this series could have been uploaded to pornhub in the Korean gangbang section
[0:19:05] zen__cloud: it's interesting how you and LS love scaling comps but caedral and others love early game
[0:19:22] PinnxelGRP: caedrel said he preferred KT's draft because they had more agency early to mid game
[0:19:37] McDumps: It will be the classic Gen G regional win, then choke at MSI!
[0:19:41] PaulyGee: I think caedrel said that he didn't mind KTs comp, because of pushing lanes, but they obviously had to be proactive
[0:19:43] thugitakhrushchev: @Shimmerz OMEGALUL
[0:20:06] PinnxelGRP: @thugitakhrushchev This series could have been an email
[0:20:16] Phixos2: only t1 consistenly pulls off these comps in the entire world i feel like
[0:20:19] Dreath1: KT can't play their own comp, I could see T1 pulling it off but definitely not KT lmao
[0:20:28] RDKi: I was watching this and wondering why they didn't live in T1's jungle
[0:20:28] ace_alchemist: good draft for perfect robots
[0:20:33] lordkeram: You need to be permanently like 5k ahead to fight on even ground. It's a terrible team composition.
[0:21:04] Fissiccisst: Fissiccisst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! half a year old, am baby
[0:21:11] archie7497: Patch 14.3 didn't change anything to udyr and aatrox. So I'm wondering where the lec is actually ahead of the meta or if it's doomed cuz we saw almost zero presence of both of these champs in the playoffs.
[0:21:21] PinnxelGRP: Faker is on a 20 game corki winstreak and a 12 game orianna winstreak
[0:21:25] MansoGanzo: faker is god
[0:21:25] Fissiccisst: *tips fedora*

[0:21:44] Dreath1: it's nice that the two POG leaders are Faker and Chovy lmao
[0:21:45] fatalqwerty: BDD missed cannon, is he officially washed?
[0:21:48] Fissiccisst: Monte using such big words I don't even know the meaning of
[0:21:49] delakv1: I’m a very good bangers only supporter
[0:21:51] thugitakhrushchev: YEP I am a pleb
[0:21:51] stevethekind: PROVE YOUR WORTH
[0:21:52] delakv1: cristoPLEB cristoPLEB
[0:21:55] BlastTelecast: I would sub but I spent all my money betting on KT

[0:22:14] stevethekind: OOF
[0:22:17] delakv1: @blasttelecast real
[0:22:19] PinnxelGRP: -3k Aware
[0:22:27] BlastTelecast: only $100
[0:22:30] BlastTelecast: still sadge
[0:22:31] Fissiccisst: Not gambling at all is the true way to win bets
[0:22:34] fatalqwerty: maybe you're the problem monte, you got excited for KT with the bets FeelsBadMan
[0:22:40] delakv1: I think KT lost most their seasons betting on kt
[0:22:41] thugitakhrushchev: it was a good underdog bet
[0:22:43] MansoGanzo: why would you bet on KT when facing T1?
[0:22:43] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:22:44] frostyfury09: you just need to get so unexcited that it rolls over and they win worlds
[0:22:57] Tsojin: Tsojin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:23:12] PinnxelGRP: I don't think Monte would want this version of KT to win Worlds LUL
[0:23:16] notanattractivefemale: When is the next episode of Four Play coming out?
[0:23:24] MansoGanzo: lmao KT always dissapointing
[0:23:36] dredge4six: to monte, hows our favorite jungler pyosik doin
[0:23:38] kshyle: betting on FRAUD AINTNOWAY
[0:23:38] dredge4six: yo*
[0:23:41] thugitakhrushchev: FRAUD ALERT
[0:23:43] PinnxelGRP: Pog
[0:23:44] Dreath1: I never ever want to see BeryL win another worlds the reddit discourse will give me an aneurysm
[0:23:44] pw479: Hey guys, is this live?
[0:23:49] MansoGanzo: Pog
[0:23:50] stevethekind: yes
[0:24:08] Crushzilla: are any of us live
[0:24:11] bbqftw_: what does being alive mean
[0:24:11] pw479: I mean the games, sorry for stupid question, I havent been following league for 4-5 years
[0:24:12] SgtMurasa: no, this is all prerecorded (including chat)
[0:24:13] PinnxelGRP: am I live Aware
[0:24:15] pw479: Idk the times :P
[0:24:27] Slayra: all KT had to do was get on the damn train
[0:24:33] MansoGanzo: why is noone playing liandry udyr? it's bonkers
[0:24:34] ogoaxe: Thank god Monte is alive.
[0:24:52] pw479: good to see you monte btw, long time ago one of favourite casters :)
[0:24:52] purpledino: I think taliyah really makes them kt good early game team ? or am I just tripping
[0:25:00] Subspontaneous: Why do you think some champions are staples in pro play? For Example Aatrox and Ksante just allowed to stay perma in Pro and enver recieved nerfs.
[0:25:01] Phixos2: good start for kt is a good summary for this game LuL
[0:25:04] RDKi: I still think KT should have tried to live in T1's jungle
[0:25:15] thugitakhrushchev: @MansoGanzo cuz pro player would rather play safe with tank items first than liandries first on udyr
[0:25:30] Dreath1: @RDKi they did try but it's hard when faker is even
[0:25:44] RDKi: They did not try
[0:26:01] MansoGanzo: @thugitakhrushchev liandry udyr is safer than last season's everfrost gragas
[0:26:08] pw479: Damn faker still playing.... is he still THAT good?
[0:26:45] SgtMurasa: @pw479 my man literally just won his 4th worlds
[0:26:55] Dreath1: I mean he's not THAT good but he's top three midlaners itw I'd say
[0:26:55] pw479: so the GOAT
[0:27:00] thugitakhrushchev: @MansoGanzo while true, but pro play doesn't play the udyr to carry
[0:27:07] PinnxelGRP: Chovy and Faker are actually tied for 1st for CSD@15 this split
[0:27:09] Dom__: This series was more about kt doing fuck all then t1 smashing them
[0:27:18] fatalqwerty: pw479 have you been living under a rock and just came out from your cave after cultivating? Faker's experiencing a second renaissance right now Kappa
[0:27:27] archie7497: @montecristo what do you think about the farming Senna that lec was doing when paired with naut? It allowed the naut to roam and got the Senna items faster.
[0:27:39] spucky117: guma stacking king this series
[0:27:39] pw479: @fatalqwerty Well I said mate, I havent been following league for 4-5 years
[0:27:45] xddaddy: monte what ever happened to that child u fathered?

[0:27:46] MansoGanzo: @thugitakhrushchev oh no i just mean liandry into tank is already strictly better, even if doubling down on ~bruiser AP udyr is super strong
[0:27:50] e6merald6: KT are actually frauds Sadge
[0:27:52] pw479: @fatalqwerty Last league Ive seen was 2018
[0:27:56] najafan: @fatalqwerty Very true. He's actually looking the best he has ever.
[0:28:12] UpYerArs: EU allergic to fasting Senna
[0:28:13] thugitakhrushchev: @MansoGanzo oh yeah, that fair
[0:28:18] fatalqwerty: SKT replaced Faker's wrists with cybernetics to let him play for 10 more years Kappa
[0:28:22] MansoGanzo: @najafan s4 was stupidly op
[0:28:32] Shimmerz: can you believe there are 8 worlds winners in this match
[0:28:33] archie7497: @upyerars they do fasting senna but not with naut.
[0:28:36] Dreath1: all of this because KT chose T1 last summer
[0:28:47] MansoGanzo: @Dreath1 KEKW
[0:28:54] fatalqwerty: @Dreath1 the domino still in effect FeelsBadMan
[0:30:06] L0rc4n: @pw479 welcome back :) faker had a dip in form for a while but last year and so far this year he has been playing excellently
[0:30:13] Slayra: Bedge what a game
[0:30:26] najafan: Okay, unironically, Faker has been playing fine. Not amazingly.
[0:30:34] spucky117: I wanna know how perfect lost his cs lead... Zeus was down like a wave and a half and now up a wave +
[0:30:40] najafan: He has a relatively limited champion pool.
[0:30:50] najafan: On those champions he performs quite well.
[0:31:02] RDKi: This feels like Faker's meta.. Ori, Hwei and Corki
[0:31:07] archie7497: @montecristo even g2 was doing farming senna. Hans farmed while miky roamed on naut
[0:31:08] UpYerArs: @archie7497 are you stupid or what, they litreally played farming senna with naut
[0:31:13] najafan: Right, he's doing fine right now.
[0:31:19] fatalqwerty: isnt his champ pool dictated by the T1 playing style?
[0:31:22] najafan: But he's definitely limited rn.
[0:31:38] stand_ur_ground: do you think farming senna is ever superior to fasting
[0:31:58] fatalqwerty: fasting senna can just get stacks and get passive money anyway
[0:32:14] archie7497: @upyerars read what I wrote ***ey do fasting Senna but not with naut. That means they do farming senna with naut.
[0:32:37] najafan: @fatalqwerty True, so Smolder and Veiger shouldn't farm either.
[0:32:49] notanattractivefemale: Have you noticed any patterns in T1s comps this year? I remember last year, you pointed out how they tended to draft a combination of poke, disengage and a reset champ, is there a similar pattern this year?
[0:32:49] Dreath1: it's illegal that T1 won this fight
[0:32:49] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:33:01] fatalqwerty: what that logic doesnt make sense @najafan do they get +8g every time they get their stacks?
[0:33:02] najafan: Fasting Smolder incoming
[0:33:04] McDumps: @Dreath1 This whole game was illegal for T1.
[0:33:11] fartnugget45: games over after second drake
[0:33:14] Shimmerz: it’s a macro last
[0:33:29] PaulyGee: Kinda crazy that T1 knows that they contest this
[0:33:32] UpYerArs: @archie7497 again you are lying. Game 5, MDK FNC fasting Senna with Maokai
[0:33:33] najafan: I mean, it's equivalent to money in terms of stats.
[0:33:34] saberaxe: Did not win that even with Karma Malignance
[0:33:36] spucky117: joever
[0:33:51] PaulyGee: Can*
[0:33:54] e6merald6: faker could've pushed deft out the wall to prevent the flash tho
[0:33:54] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  t1 games are the most boring games to watch. I hate their playstyle and their fans.
[0:33:59] thugitakhrushchev: FH Aware
[0:34:04] spucky117: Zeus casually up 2 waves some how
[0:34:05] Shimmerz: this is where KT puts getting banged in the bangers only
[0:34:36] McDumps: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[0:34:51] RDKi: I think this roster has already shown that they can be diverse and they will be diverse when they need to be ... generally
[0:35:06] fartnugget45: who needs diversity when you can just witness zeus gapping everyone
[0:35:12] Phixos2: thats gg, FF
[0:35:13] AdmiralReggie: never collected the eye Sadge
[0:35:18] UpYerArs: Perfect Teleport
[0:35:23] PinnxelGRP: ggg
[0:35:30] gerbilsdontexist: tbf, T1 monopolized the LCK,  Zeus was in their academy, and so was guma, and so was keria, and so was oner, they have a monopoly on most of the young talent in the LCK development scene because they literally have infinite money
[0:35:32] Dreath1: this game is lost man
[0:35:36] fatalqwerty: I think it was unnecessary for Deft to walk so forward like that, he just got bopped
[0:35:38] MansoGanzo: i think mid just doesnt matter that much right now, surprise picks make no difference
[0:35:38] madiiiman: Monte are we ready to have a convo about how KT is the second best team in the LCK? Kappa
[0:35:39] gerbilsdontexist: its bullshit, its like these top teams in Europe
[0:35:48] madiiiman: GenG lost to this Keepo
[0:35:54] McDumps: @gerbilsdontexist Thought Keria was on DRX before T1?
[0:35:58] a_lonely_observer: Not gonna do tes lng?
[0:36:03] archie7497: @upyerars mate that's what I said. They do play fasting senna, where the support farms like the game you mentioned where the maokai farmed. When they play Senna naut they play farming Senna. I can't tell if you are trolling or you have limited reading comprehension
[0:36:26] MansoGanzo: huge senna ult
[0:36:28] fatalqwerty: It was warded! Why did Deft walk forward like that
[0:36:38] hazygreys: faker finally appears
[0:36:45] spucky117: t1s players allow for a  nearly impossible to solve draft puzzle they started to play into it at worlds ... and nobody in lck has been able to force them to alter their game plan
[0:36:45] e6merald6: @McDumps yeah he was
[0:37:18] MansoGanzo: +poppy
[0:37:22] saberaxe: and poppy
[0:37:27] DisturbedFrog: @gerbilsdontexist also the prestige of playing on T1 attracts players
[0:37:41] najafan: Poppy my beloved
[0:38:09] Professional_Aellith: What the hell was Perfect even doing bot side? His teleport waited until the fight was over
[0:38:10] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:38:24] Civilli: sorry monte, kt vs t1 was not a banger this time FeelsBadMan
[0:38:42] Shimmerz: will we be seeing another TSM crusade eulogy this year
[0:38:43] ForestPolice: ayeee its monte!!
[0:38:52] najafan: What if I want to cast 2XKO?
[0:38:58] zen__cloud: i mean the couple caster duos we got in cs are amazing :)
[0:38:58] najafan: Kappa
[0:39:01] Shimmerz: then find a new want
[0:39:04] ForestPolice: ForestPolice subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! weeee
[0:39:07] j00se9: riot will fire you for no reason after a few years as well if you work for them and work hard :)
[0:39:08] ForestPolice: tele war
[0:39:10] spucky117: t1 looks so bored
[0:39:30] stevethekind: PAY YOUR GOD
[0:39:44] fartnugget45: game was literally ff after they lost that fight at second drake
[0:39:52] fartnugget45: everyone just going through the motions at this point
[0:39:52] Dreath1: split is a formality yet again let's just skip to geng vs t1 again
[0:40:33] spucky117: @montecristo did you see keria was breaking down after getting so much hate for his ezreal pick?
[0:40:38] McDumps: @MonteCristo And how good Rito's investigation process is. Spot on awful.
[0:40:42] DisturbedFrog: can you reveal what you got paid when you were casting?
[0:40:49] ReapersArk: Do you think once VR games becomes the new golden standard of gaming some decades into the future that casting will work the same way as it does now?
[0:41:01] UpYerArs: @archie7497 there's only two games in the playoffs where fasting senna was played. if 14% is your idea of the region playing fasting senna then you need to clean up that drool on your keyboard
[0:41:02] najafan: Or 2XKO Kappa
[0:41:14] fatalqwerty: BG voice for caedrel or tarik's stream OMEGALUL
[0:41:17] Shimmerz: what if instead of casting valorent we could go outside and touch grass
[0:41:19] TheMommik: Find a lower mid end game, work your ass off for years and you could become someone like T90
[0:41:24] Subspontaneous: Do you know name of epsiode where you discuss overwatch problems?
[0:41:25] madiiiman: @Shimmerz can you cast that?
[0:41:27] adam_faith: have you watched any of the stormgate stuff going on? @MonteCristo , ive been playing it alot, so much fun and i ahve high hopes!
[0:41:32] Shimmerz: IRL yea
[0:41:38] Shimmerz: look at this grass
[0:41:39] Gworkag: Only decent way to make money is to be a non english caster tbh
[0:41:40] madiiiman: KEKW monte wasnt paid by riot thats the thing
[0:41:41] Shimmerz: is that the sun
[0:41:42] madiiiman: they stiffed him
[0:41:45] Shimmerz: I haven’t seen that in years
[0:41:48] Noiramei: I'd just do it as a hobby on your own youtube channel if you really want to cast.
[0:42:08] PinnxelGRP: there are other valorant costreamers like Tenz, sinatraa, FNS, Som who get like 5-15k but tarik gets like 50k yeah
[0:42:10] najafan: @madiiiman "Look at the grass, look at the moves! Feet, what was that?!"
[0:42:13] MansoGanzo: that's a nice salary, fully deserved btw
[0:42:16] fatalqwerty: we should ask the serious questions, how much did you get casting starcraft Kappa
[0:42:25] Professional_Aellith: $100k a year? That's a lot of mochi
[0:42:27] Noiramei: AND you're living in LA XD
[0:42:29] McDumps: And you're in LA.
[0:42:42] PinnxelGRP: Aware
[0:42:45] zen__cloud: living in LA is expensive and bad
[0:42:46] Imaslapyou: How many hours is the avg broadcasting day
[0:43:04] MansoGanzo: Pog
[0:43:07] ReapersArk: Does playoff days give higher rates than normal league days?
[0:43:07] SnivySSBM: basically gotta roommate with the other casters at that point.
[0:43:14] Longhorn_Steakhouse: machine

[0:43:15] Shimmerz: the additional money being industry standard from riot yeah?
[0:43:16] PinnxelGRP: Machine and SpunJ EZ
[0:43:18] arielleej: @MonteCristo Have you had a chance to catch any of SI that's been happening? Insane crowd energy at that event this year.
[0:43:21] MansoGanzo: casting mogul Pog
[0:43:22] stevethekind: shout out Sjokz
[0:43:25] DisturbedFrog: 1500 sounds super low when they'd barely reach 40 days per year unless they get worlds + MSI
[0:43:26] Subspontaneous: Why did you end up leaving LCK?
[0:43:31] TheMommik: Won't freelancers get paid for the meetings and other in-house prep? @MonteCristo
[0:43:34] MansoGanzo: WHAT
[0:43:34] stevethekind: LOL WHAT
[0:43:34] ceviche_lol: lol
[0:43:36] stevethekind: LMFAOO
[0:43:38] McDumps: Lol
[0:43:38] ace_alchemist: WHAT
[0:43:40] violincake: What
[0:43:40] adam_faith: because riot
[0:43:46] thugitakhrushchev: RIOT
[0:43:51] TheMommik: oof
[0:43:58] unimonosolo: riot cant afford to pay more PoroSad
[0:44:01] najafan: I mean, if you're *salaried* I get that.
[0:44:01] Suga__Shane: lemme guess "you're welcome for getting the opportunity to cast worlds"
[0:44:03] ReapersArk: Lmao somehow their system for payments is even worse than their client
[0:44:08] borichorichap: sounds like they need to unionize
[0:44:10] stevethekind: its okay project L will save riot XD
[0:44:14] Professional_Aellith: But remember lads, Riot is just a small indie company
[0:44:19] McDumps: @Suga__Shane Think of the exposure you get?!
[0:44:21] gabrieljallo: who are your favorite lpl players
[0:44:27] DisturbedFrog: I can see why Caedrel pulled the pin lmao
[0:44:27] Subspontaneous: Papasmithy and Monte were the golden years of league.
[0:44:39] Zebrios: @MonteCristo It seems your prediction of the KT razor cake came true.  Pyosik has indeed turned back into a pumpkin.
[0:44:41] happyfeet5354k: why is riot so cheap? arent they rich
[0:44:44] adam_faith: corki still not nerfed huh...
[0:44:53] najafan: @adam_faith He was.
[0:44:53] MansoGanzo: (rookie)
[0:44:54] Dreath1: Scout aware
[0:44:55] stevethekind: RULER
[0:44:58] najafan: Eclipse was nerfed.
[0:45:01] definitelynotkus: rookie
[0:45:02] stevethekind: ELK
[0:45:03] fatalqwerty: No Rookie? FeelsBadMan
[0:45:03] Professional_Aellith: You don't get rich by spending money
[0:45:08] thugitakhrushchev: Ruler TrollDespair
[0:45:09] beautifulminds: Squidward?
[0:45:11] najafan: Eclipse was the reason he was doing the uber damage.
[0:45:16] Scout_Hermes: Rookie?
[0:45:18] iziter: rookie masterrace
[0:45:22] najafan: He's just still strong.
[0:45:23] UpYerArs: Scout hasnt been the same since Faker spanked him
[0:45:27] Shimmerz: is defts beryl prison akin to the space prison of prior years
[0:45:41] Dreath1: Scout got rolled up into a blunt by Zeka and Faker consecutively and I think something snapped
[0:45:46] najafan: @Shimmerz Hey, Space was actually decent in S5.
[0:45:48] stevethekind: kerias engage here is insane
[0:45:50] najafan: Not, you know, good.
[0:45:52] najafan: But decent.
[0:45:59] AdmiralReggie: YEP
[0:45:59] MansoGanzo: non-worlds beryl is just too shit
[0:46:13] madiiiman: faker global taunt in full effect
[0:46:21] stevethekind: Keria with the naut tech tho...
[0:46:27] PinnxelGRP: they got Faker EZ
[0:46:29] McDumps: @MonteCristo KT got bodied in Draft.
[0:46:29] Lastmike: Zeus Aatrox is nasty
[0:46:36] fatalqwerty: this is just damn sad to watch, I'll just wait for the BLG vs JDG games
[0:46:39] Zebrios: Faker mind control
[0:46:42] mr_steno: @montecristo do you ever get nostalgic for casting league when you listen to your friends cast?
[0:47:11] najafan: My hot take: Every single player, no matter the role, needs to practice Mao, Poppy, and Sion, so they can flex them everywhere.
[0:47:11] Shimmerz: it was a sinners comp
[0:47:12] cuedp: is the Kalista lane that good that it’s worth picking?
[0:47:12] Dom__: They weren't proactive at allc
[0:47:14] MansoGanzo: that legit only worked in LCK if you were prime damwon
[0:47:21] najafan: They're just that strong atm.
[0:47:22] FuHua_HoS: is this more so a coach issue or player issue in terms of drafting?
[0:47:23] spucky117: they had to disable neeko cause t1 figured out keria could pretend to be faker
[0:47:31] PinnxelGRP: Stories about casting make me wonder if its possible to ever run a league system without RIOT's consent. Games developer shouldn't own every single esports related venture related to their game
[0:47:31] ReapersArk: Was casting league or owl more fun?
[0:47:34] Lopseypop: @najafan Rell
[0:47:50] najafan: @Lopseypop I don't think Rell is a 5-flex.
[0:47:59] SSaVii: what other ones?
[0:48:01] stevethekind: Stormgate casts in the future ?
[0:48:03] mr_steno: plus how they treated you with renegades was pretty bs
[0:48:04] adam_faith: im hopeing you will go for 8 with stormgate :D
[0:48:06] Gworkag: Keria Outlevel Pyosik...
[0:48:09] McDumps: @MonteCristo Now you need to cast WoW's race to world first.
[0:48:11] Subspontaneous: Personally I think OW had a spectator problem it wasnt as easy to follow as a game like league.
[0:48:12] Zebrios: I feel like casting OWL was probably about as fun as watching it - near impossible because of the first person perspective.
[0:48:21] knguyen722: Can I still use the Factor lfn code if I already started the service before you guys got sponsored?
[0:48:21] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:48:57] Dragnok212: Real OGs know you as Monte the vainglory caster Kappa
[0:49:02] stevethekind: I have an Optic H3CZ xbox 360 case.
[0:49:05] arielleej: @MonteCristo Speaking of 4-horsemen, have you ever looked at the WoW Race to World First events?
[0:49:06] fatalqwerty: Ever miss casting Vainglory Monte? Kappa
[0:49:06] mikethetank: i miss HoTs
[0:49:06] Dreath1: they actually fucking 5 manned zeus bot I forgot about this lmfao
[0:49:08] madiiiman: zeus was a fraction of a second from one shotting deft
[0:49:10] Zebrios: Zeus for inhib turret.
[0:49:10] najafan: @PinnxelGRP Go to your congressperson's local meetings, talk to them about the issue. Try to convince them that it's a problem. They work for you, at least theoretically.
[0:49:11] madiiiman: that q3 was death
[0:49:12] madiiiman: if it hit
[0:49:12] Zebrios: Good trade
[0:49:16] adam_faith: ive bee playing a ton of stormgate, and watching the pros, super fun to play and handles well, just missing polish and a third race! @MonteCristo
[0:49:19] Dom__: Only took them 27 minutes to do shit lol
[0:49:26] kaliez: Do you still play rts?
[0:49:28] Lopseypop: Zeus > Base
[0:49:39] e6merald6: are you gonna play 2xko?
[0:49:39] commando1814: ldd
[0:49:40] mikethetank: did you cast heroes fo the storm?
[0:49:47] Subspontaneous: How was the relationship with OW staff?
[0:49:48] UpYerArs: What is Blud BeryL doing
[0:49:49] IgonnaBe3: so one thing that one of my lawyer friends mentioned is that gaming companies could be on the hook in the future for not providing access to a product for people after shutting down servers
[0:49:49] McDumps: @arielleej I agree.
[0:49:49] madiiiman: @e6merald6 he cant pronounce it how can he play it Kappa
[0:49:51] anygeorge: I miss the vainglory days
[0:49:53] fatalqwerty: It's a shame Mobile Legends Bang Bang ( OMEGALUL ) won the MOBA wars in mobile
[0:49:55] stevethekind: doesnt Deft play sivir ?
[0:50:00] najafan: @najafan (The secret is that very few people actually go to meetings for Representatives, so if you go to their meetings and talk to them, it makes an impression on them.)
[0:50:04] UpYerArs: WHAT IS BERYL DOING
[0:50:05] PinnxelGRP: Vainglory was a bop, I played that shit throughout highschool with my friends and we would get kicked out of the library because we were tapping on our school issued ipads so hard it was making too much noise LUL good times
[0:50:06] Imaslapyou: Hoping the AoM remake/master is good
[0:50:06] Zebrios: Unironically HotS got better after it died.
[0:50:13] e6merald6: @fatalqwerty it's really popular in SEA
[0:50:24] anygeorge: Gotta laugh the "Super Evil Mega Corp" is the best one to work with
[0:50:26] e6merald6: @madiiiman LUL
[0:50:32] Slash_Phantom: typical blizzard behavior
[0:50:40] McDumps: @anygeorge Monte does seem like a heel caster though.
[0:50:42] commando1814: did you get to meet jeff from the overwatch team
[0:50:43] kaliez: do you prefer SC style rts or Supreme commander?
[0:50:52] boulderthan: what's DOA up to?
[0:50:54] Shimmerz: that’s how they get you
[0:50:58] Zebrios: You know what was a fucking banger MOBA that got unfairly cancelled?  Heroes of Newerth.  That game was so good for its time.
[0:50:58] ahafiz97: who are your favourite LCK players and team?
[0:51:00] fatalqwerty: @e6merald6 I think Vainglory was the better product tbh MLBB just feels like a straight up league ripoff
[0:51:00] arielleej: @McDumps Yeah, I just brought it up because it's unique in that it's a grassroots event that by its nature, cannot be controlled by the developer.
[0:51:07] AdmiralReggie: KEKW
[0:51:07] commando1814: kaplan always seemed like good dude
[0:51:08] Imaslapyou: LUL
[0:51:10] madiiiman: KEK
[0:51:12] AdmiralReggie: the disrespect TPO LUL
[0:51:15] AdmiralReggie: *TP
[0:51:15] Shimmerz: macroblast
[0:51:19] PinnxelGRP: @najafan yeah I attend townhalls and stuff for my local representatives but no rep is gonna care about this niche issue. Not enough voter people care
[0:51:21] Lopseypop: GIGACHAD KEria
[0:51:26] McDumps: @arielleej Unless you're a dirty Echo fan.
[0:51:30] MansoGanzo: GIGACHAD
[0:51:31] commando1814: the dickhead bm tp is art
[0:51:33] ahafiz97: Also who do you think will win MSI??
[0:51:37] lelouch_03: @MonteCristo is it possible that the Saudi run event has a possibility of overtaking the prestige of worlds just like what happened in dota?
[0:51:37] AsiaPowa: GIGACHAD
[0:51:38] commando1814: hang it in the lauve
[0:51:48] e6merald6: @fatalqwerty I don't think League can't talk about ripping off something when they also ripped off from dota
[0:52:01] TimeSlayerX: Favorite Total war game?
[0:52:04] Lastmike: rise of nations PogBones
[0:52:05] Ryden7: WC4? WTF
[0:52:08] commando1814: WAIT R O N ? MY FAV GAME EVER
[0:52:10] zen__cloud: yo i love Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends
[0:52:10] fatalqwerty: only dota2 diehards still say that tho @e6merald6
[0:52:11] SSaVii: Any interest in the dota scene at all? @MonteCristo
[0:52:12] MansoGanzo: opinions on age of empires?
[0:52:14] IgonnaBe3: do you think an open source game could circumvent the copyright issue around esports? it would have to be really good and get popular first but i wonder if some random devs poured some work hours in, wouldnt be the first time @MonteCristo
[0:52:14] stevethekind: did you play Terren artoDance
[0:52:19] SgtMurasa: have you played dawngate?
[0:52:23] najafan: @PinnxelGRP They might care just because they think it's interesting. Some do. If you frame it as copyrights generating markets, which they're not supposed to do, that's a really interesting element of law to fix.
[0:52:28] Zebrios: Honestly they don't need to release Warcraft 4 if their handling of the Diablo 4 franchise is any indication.
[0:52:32] Fissiccisst: imagine playing terran
[0:52:35] stevethekind: ZERG SUPREMACY
[0:52:37] Subspontaneous: Monte seems like a big crypto guy
[0:52:37] Shimmerz: a sinner
[0:52:38] commando1814: MONTE IS A FILTHY ZERG
[0:52:41] DisturbedFrog: fuck yeah Zerg
[0:52:45] e6merald6: @fatalqwerty I'm just saying league also did the same thing so I don't think they can talk about being ripped off and shit
[0:52:48] Phixos2: fan of Civ V? @MonteCristo
[0:52:51] Shobes572: @montecristo you look like a zerg player
[0:52:53] ReapersArk: Should casters be skilled at the game theyre casting or is that overrated?
[0:52:55] najafan: @najafan Indeed, BECAUSE it's so niche it's more likely to get fixed, it won't become a culture war issue.
[0:52:57] RoughRunner98: fuckgin zerg scum
[0:53:00] Dreamchosis: zerg GIGACHAD
[0:53:01] zen__cloud: would you ever do a campaign playthrough of Rise of Legends for the stream?
[0:53:03] commando1814: who had the op ass tank in rise of legends
[0:53:11] Zebrios: Game ender
[0:53:11] SSaVii: Ever play dota2?
[0:53:15] lelouch_03: @Zebrios why are you talking about diablo 4 when the reforged is trashhhh
[0:53:16] Zebrios: RIP KT
[0:53:20] Dreath1: this was a beautiful fight from T1 actually
[0:53:24] TheMommik: @MonteCristo have you checked out AoE2? They are currently doing a very interesting Tourno, where players are using pseudonymes so you don't know exactly who you face.
[0:53:25] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:53:27] Professional_Aellith: Zerg? Unsubbed, unfollowed, unremembered, cookies cleared, and browser deleted
[0:53:31] PinnxelGRP: I like how Faker tp's to end the game while Zeus tp's to get kills LUL
[0:53:31] fatalqwerty: @e6merald6 even the earliest version of League has substantial difference from warcraft dota tho
[0:53:33] AdmiralReggie: AoE 2 is 10 bucks on steam right now
[0:53:34] MissingMatter: @Zebrios I have no idea what Diablo 4 was like, because Starcraft 2 was my last straw for Blizzard games.
[0:53:36] Zebrios: @lelouch_03 honestly I had purged Warcraft Refunded from my memory
[0:53:39] kaliez: have you play grand rts like supreme commander?
[0:53:41] McDumps: @MonteCristo Did you ever meet BoxeR? Was one of my favorite SC player.
[0:53:43] lelouch_03: @MonteCristo why did you think that rts a genre died?
[0:53:43] TimeSlayerX: Most overvalued player from 2022 DRX
[0:53:59] commando1814: what was the unit that vini had that was hilariusly strong
[0:54:05] stevethekind: I prefer T1 to limp into worlds rather than be stomping every other team. Setting us up for disappointment.
[0:54:13] Phixos2: faker from downtown
[0:54:15] Stormserpent101: @lelouch_03 people wanted instant gratification more
[0:54:16] Lopseypop: Deft gets deleted
[0:54:20] Lastmike: the one loss of T1 is from GenG?
[0:54:23] Zebrios: KT knew Oner was there tho
[0:54:41] Ryden7: Is it worth it tho if Keria is sad Peepo
[0:54:45] PinnxelGRP: Sending Udyr into orbit is like taking the clothes of a person, KT looked so naked without their primary frontline LUL
[0:54:49] Dreath1: jesus this was gorgeous actually the more I look at it
[0:55:03] MansoGanzo: Kreygasm
[0:55:06] rilsolo: deft did not have a fun time this series
[0:55:10] SirKavouris: the goats
[0:55:12] Zebrios: Zeus TPs for kills while Faker goes for base LUL
[0:55:25] spucky117: I swear that Zeus make aatrox's abilities look point and click
[0:55:33] Ryden7: @MonteCristo Whats your opinion on StormGate?
[0:55:35] SgtMurasa: in voice comms zeus even says he's tping top then tps to bot ward anyway KEKW
[0:55:39] SirKavouris: monte whats your opinion on keria flaming the haters for picking ezreal support
[0:55:39] PinnxelGRP: well that was depressing
[0:55:47] PinnxelGRP: maybe game 2 will be more close... Aware
[0:55:49] HiimSub: @rilsolo game 2 wasn't better for him lol
[0:56:05] rilsolo: @HiimSub nope poor guy LuL
[0:56:10] Zebrios: Yeah Maybe Game 2 will be closer Aware
[0:56:12] Shimmerz: so Monte, do you think the next game can’t be as one sided as the first one right
[0:56:23] iziter: did you see that faner hides in ori ball in abilites that chinese fans found, is that legit or cope?
[0:56:25] Shimmerz: like it can’t be in a losing state sooner than second drag
[0:56:52] fatalqwerty: i think SC2 is a mistake too, tbh FeelsBadMan
[0:56:52] McDumps: SC2 did get out sold by an in game WoW purchase.
[0:56:56] Lamynator: I think Stormgate's drawing inspiration from all the wrong RTS games
[0:57:03] kaliez: C&C fan?
[0:57:05] najafan: What's your opinion on bringing freedom and democracy to alien bugs?
[0:57:18] thugitakhrushchev: xdd
[0:57:19] RoughRunner98: almost like they worked at blizzard hmmm
[0:57:22] McDumps: @najafan Super Earth must be represented to them bugs.
[0:57:27] commando1814: the da vinci faction was my shit
[0:57:28] Noiramei: they had the world and they trying to play it safe
[0:57:30] Zebrios: I LOVED C&C Generals because of the variety of gameplay types it had.
[0:57:35] lelouch_03: agree lol
[0:57:46] ReapersArk: Ive watched artosis stream and make videos on it aswell. There are ALOT of parrallel between SC2 and stormgate
[0:57:49] lelouch_03: wc3 setting is the best
[0:57:50] rs_bennyboi: Who do you think is the best caster in league of legends right now ?
[0:57:54] commando1814: @Zebrios im a filthy col burrton enjoyer
[0:57:56] TheMommik: You can take a dev out of Blizzard, but it's hard to take Blizzard out of the dev LUL
[0:58:00] PinnxelGRP: Aware oh
[0:58:04] Ryden7: Kek, it looks like shit. Went back 10 years
[0:58:04] MansoGanzo: wc3 was GREAT

[0:58:18] astroflipper: you think faker is the best mid in LCK rn?
[0:58:20] najafan: Why can't I have my Kabbalah inspired faction man?
[0:58:23] Zebrios: Atlus is so good at filling dead air with dry humor.

[0:58:53] Lamynator: Will you be reviewing Avatar with Doa at some point?
[0:59:00] RoughRunner98: monte what should kt do with that comp to get the gold lead? caedral said they should have dove aatrox but idk
[0:59:01] SirKavouris: visual bugs with the clone?
[0:59:02] HeySugar: I think the neeko bug has to do with protobelt
[0:59:06] kaliez: any golden road prediction this year?
[0:59:10] commando1814: atlas could be the hype man for a hiest movie
[0:59:10] StealingYoIPZ: my wife of 7 years just asked for a divorce today.....guess im drowning my sorrows with monte's stream
[0:59:11] Subspontaneous: How did you originally get into LoL?
[0:59:14] Zebrios: Neeko is disabled because of the Chovy play with the emotes extending the clone.
[0:59:19] SESRoots: I want some Monte Doa Deficio casting :)
[0:59:19] avakan48: @Irreli thank you
[0:59:23] Phixos2: first impressions on avatar?
[0:59:29] Phixos2: i hear its not complete garbage
[0:59:33] Lopseypop: Avatar is so so so bad
[0:59:37] Slayra: time for 🐮
[0:59:37] McDumps: I want IWD to cast worlds.
[0:59:41] PinnxelGRP: is it better than the movie Clueless
[0:59:52] Irreli: @avakan48 np
[0:59:54] MansoGanzo: [it was garbage]
[0:59:55] rs_bennyboi: I havent dared to watch it
[0:59:56] commando1814: is one peace the only real great 2d to live action transfer
[0:59:56] Professional_Aellith: Did you get caught stealing her sister's IP?
[0:59:59] Rumblextristana: I remember Atlus casting back in 2015, and I love when he would sceam whenever a big fight happened.
[1:00:08] brainfoley: That's like, your opinion man Kappa
[1:00:08] Lastmike: @StealingYoIPZ freedom EZ
[1:00:15] commando1814: @Rumblextristana that man loves his pick plays
[1:00:26] L0rc4n: I'm clipping that reaction from Monte and sending it to anyone when they ask how I feel about the new avatar
[1:00:28] McDumps: @brainfoley Only old people will get this.
[1:00:29] cruckurjack: @MonteCristo why didnt kt pick ori. is it because bdd isnt that great on ori?
[1:00:32] Lamynator: I must bei n a minority for disliking the one piece live action.  I feel like they made creative decisions that bury the show and lore longterm
[1:00:36] DilfZaddy: comparing it to the avatar live action movie, it’s a masterpiece
[1:00:51] Zebrios: Perfect plays really well against Zeus in lane this game.  Just... everything else is on fire.
[1:01:05] Phixos2: well its gnar vs ksante, not too hard to do well as gnar imo
[1:01:06] Shobes572: Shobes572 gifted a Tier 1 sub to DilfZaddy! They have given 76 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:01:11] squires: I understand wanting to reach new audiences, but my reaction to basically all the live action Netflix remakes is "I can just go watch the original"
[1:01:16] Lastmike: Faker really is the goat, how does he still keep the level after so many years FeelsStrongMan
[1:01:19] MansoGanzo: @Lamynator it was never intended to be long term, they needed cash fast cause the platform is dying
[1:01:21] najafan: I still recommend The Prisoner for Nerd Legion. It's a MI6 agent who resigns in the middle of the Cold War and is kidnapped and finds himself in a kafkaesque village where they attempt to manipulate him into revealing information and force him to socially conform.
[1:01:30] DilfZaddy: ty daddy shobes
[1:01:32] Mizzzraim: zeri ban against guma kinda suspect
[1:01:35] DilfZaddy: <3
[1:01:44] Shobes572: YW @dilfzaddy
[1:01:49] StealingYoIPZ: does guma come from a super rich family?
[1:01:49] Rumblextristana: Kinda glad zeri isn't picked as much as she was back in 2022.
[1:01:50] Lastmike: smolder :O
[1:02:00] Dreath1: oh right this is the game keria astro smurfs
[1:02:02] L0rc4n: you're not ready for this draft LUL
[1:02:03] Lamynator: the yu yu hakusho live action was pretty interesting though, kinda sad no one talked about that one
[1:02:06] RoughRunner98: they are up a game so they are showing the league they can pick smolder
[1:02:07] stevethekind: BIG
[1:02:08] Lopseypop: Wukong ono
[1:02:11] stevethekind: THE KONG
[1:02:12] MansoGanzo: PepeLaugh does he know
[1:02:15] commando1814: is the word peculiar still the caster version of bless your heart
[1:02:22] Zebrios: @MonteCristo How quickly do you think KT could POSSIBLY throw this game?  Just your guess.
[1:02:23] fartnugget45: I watched the One Piece live action and enjoyed it. I've never wanted to watch the anime because the art style is complete dogwater imo. I've also heard the anime suffers from awful filler issues similar to dragonball z from the era. I've heard they are rebooting the anime and I'm actually excited to try that out

[1:15:18] ChelZfan: hello Monte, strictly talking about the money you can get from views on streams (i.e., not counting subs/members/VOD rewatches), is YT or Twitch a better platform for that?
[1:15:25] homelander369: How does keria have 2 deaths when kt got 1 kill?
[1:15:36] rs_bennyboi: All facts i hear u @MonteCristo

[1:18:41] homelander369: Smolder has mechanics that guma could have used thr such as e into the right wall to avoid that hook
[1:18:52] Zebrios: @claps_121 A lot of it is Keria dropping wards in the right spots.

[1:19:09] rs_bennyboi: What is your opinion about bin? @MonteCristo
[1:19:19] Zebrios: PepeLaugh
[1:19:24] McDumps: @Zebrios Mostly cause Neeko is disabled during this patch. But he coulda played Sion.
[1:19:35] Slayra: he has not bin PepeLaugh
[1:19:52] rs_bennyboi: Dont u think thats a question of meta ? Bin heavily transcends with camille/fiora/jax picks
[1:19:54] kaliez: whats your prediction on faker 77th unique pick
[1:20:05] fartnugget45: Deft LUL
[1:20:06] Lopseypop: Deft PepeLaugh
[1:20:08] Slayra: oops alistair did it again PepeLaugh
[1:20:13] Phixos2: oh no, its deft again PepeLaugh
[1:20:25] claps_121: Deft OMEGALUL
[1:20:25] Phixos2: cool fact about this play, i think keria pressed Alistar E to mask his q-flash @MonteCristo
[1:20:28] Mortryx: !RANKINGS
[1:20:28] Moobot: @Mortryx MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:20:33] Zebrios: LUL
[1:20:42] mr_steno: @montecristo feels interesting how varying what people think optimal builds on smolder is
[1:20:54] Slayra: walks in, places ward, refuses to elaborate, dies. PepeLaugh
[1:20:57] Shobes572: Deft cristoCAKE ?
[1:20:57] LastArchangeI: It's Pyosik's fault somehow
[1:20:58] Zebrios: Apparently not.
[1:20:59] beautifulminds: possibly
[1:21:01] ace_alchemist: nope
[1:21:05] McDumps: I'm startin to the he doesn't.
[1:21:06] KnightEnder3: wait till you see the rest of the game lol
[1:21:13] Lamynator: that might be the oldest combo in the game
[1:21:13] Phixos2: oh we will find out later this game PepeLaugh
[1:21:13] madiiiman: i told u monte
[1:21:15] rs_bennyboi: Dont u think thats a question of meta ? Bin heavily transcends with camille/fiora/jax picks
[1:21:19] AdmiralReggie: truly a top island game
[1:21:20] madiiiman: he likes when keria flashes him
[1:21:21] madiiiman: hes into it
[1:21:21] fartnugget45: first pick alistar into deft every time free win
[1:21:22] HASTERIOUS: I would hope so, didn't he play with heart who played Alistar?
[1:21:23] Lopseypop: Just wait PepeLaugh
[1:21:24] JuanseCap: deft kinda new to the game, probably learning the champs
[1:21:27] madiiiman: it happens 2 more times
[1:21:30] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  Deft got hard carried to win a world championship lol
[1:21:35] kaliez: hes prob tilted at this point
[1:21:37] hobnobbin: They should make a Worlds video about Deft's decline. like in 2 years.
[1:21:44] Slayra: surely Deft will learn for future fights PepeLaugh
[1:21:44] homelander369: Deft could not stand letting pyosik and beryl up on the fraud meter @montecristo
[1:21:49] dah777: oh no PepeLaugh
[1:21:50] hobnobbin: And it should start with that
[1:22:00] zen__cloud: perfect seems pretty solid as a rookie
[1:22:00] spucky117: Keira's engage angles this game are s++
[1:22:11] Dreath1: deft played really well last year he was damwon's only hope
[1:22:13] Mizzzraim: @rs_bennyboi well, camille and fiora have been really fringe picks for like at least 2 years
[1:22:24] Phixos2: top matchup is looking pretty stable, it would be a shame if that were to shame PepeLaugh
[1:22:33] Lopseypop: I dont think its a major story this game but Oner makes Pyosik look bronze 3
[1:22:36] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  teams legitimately lose their mind when they play T1, its not even T1 playing extraordinarily well. teams just go ape shit chicken with its head cut off crazy
[1:22:55] kaliez: @gerbilsdontexist its the faker mind control
[1:23:02] Zebrios: Faker mind control is real
[1:23:03] Juanjovc26: @MonteCristo why there are tean that do 4 grubs and let the other 2 despawn? any reasoning for that?
[1:23:08] ethanrileyg: what do you think of Canyon’s performance so far this year?
[1:23:11] hayjaw: How big is the difference between 5 and 6 grubs
[1:23:12] gerbilsdontexist: they mind control the enemy team to be retarded
[1:23:14] rs_bennyboi: Dont u think thats a question of meta ? Bin heavily transcends with camille/fiora/jax picks @MonteCristo
[1:23:23] imZenlol: @gerbilsdontexist crazy that this thing happened multiple times are worlds 🤔 maybe it's not really a fluke
[1:23:27] rs_bennyboi: @Mizzzraim also very true
[1:23:38] Zebrios: Stacks accelerate
[1:23:49] Charca773: cdr + lvls n shit
[1:23:51] madiiiman: it accelerates
[1:23:53] kaliez: @gerbilsdontexist its proven faker mind control his team and the enemy
[1:23:53] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:24:05] Zebrios: Plus you also get to steal jungle camps
[1:24:08] CrimzsCast: This series was not a banger unfortunately
[1:24:09] saberaxe: the growth rate is exponential
[1:24:16] Noiramei: turbo button
[1:24:26] PinnxelGRP: @rs_bennyboi Bin is better on Jax but Zeus is better on Camille/Fiora. He was dominating on them in Spring 2022
[1:24:33] homelander369: Most pros goes er rush but nemesis is doing triforce rush i wonder which is btr
[1:24:33] gerbilsdontexist: @imZenlol WBG was the worst team to ever make worlds finals next to fnatic
[1:24:45] gerbilsdontexist: T1 last year wolrds win is easily the most pathetic
[1:24:53] Zebrios: Keria randomly in the jungle LUL
[1:24:53] AnonymousNihilist: @gerbilsdontexist the finals was T1 JDG
[1:25:04] stevethekind: blg jdg was indeed a banger
[1:25:04] ethanrileyg: t1 beat JDG bruh
[1:25:07] Phixos2: @gerbilsdontexist do you mean the whole run or just finals?
[1:25:08] vrozeus: Oh yea that one was a banger
[1:25:09] AdmiralReggie: Got to watch telecom wars
[1:25:16] McDumps: @gerbilsdontexist Tell me how you really feel.
[1:25:17] imZenlol: @gerbilsdontexist bro just discredited LNG, BLG, GENG and JDG in a single sentence 😭
[1:25:19] hobnobbin: I like that option in a champ.  Stack for late or have laning presence.
[1:25:21] PinnxelGRP: @gerbilsdontexist they beat the top 4 teams from the strongest region in the world LUL it was not pathetic whatsoever, it was one of the more convincing runs
[1:25:26] Imaslapyou: Do you think this was KT choking or par for the course
[1:25:28] Amaresu_: this was the cleanest series ever played by T1
[1:25:29] cruckurjack: @MonteCristo does this lost from kt drop them lower on the power rankings?
[1:25:32] Slayra: telecom stomp peepoSad
[1:25:34] vrozeus: Elk turns out is still a fillial son
[1:25:41] najafan: @Imaslapyou cristoCAKE cristoCAKE cristoCAKE cristoCAKE
[1:25:42] Amaresu_: like actually cleanest series i ve seen in 13 years
[1:25:50] fartnugget45: theres no way ER isnt just bis on smolder. he scales with sheen and crit, and he needs the mana. Other sheen items are probably fine but just inferior
[1:25:54] Goatsguffle: IM DOING MY PART
[1:26:00] HeySugar: it's not a telecom war, it's a telecom genocide
[1:26:07] claps_121: BLG JDG has the most fraudulent ending. Series was banger overall but the ending was just fraudulent.
[1:26:07] pandagrog: @Amaresu_ BatChest
[1:26:20] Shobes572: @montecristo BLAZING SADDLES

[1:26:50] AnonymousNihilist: what did you think of KDF vs BRO?
[1:26:51] PinnxelGRP: You guys need to do a Korean movie arc, there are so many niche bangers
[1:26:51] Zebrios: Monte didn't even comment on Perfect dying.  Sadge
[1:26:53] liamismyname3: When tsm won IEM that one time and fans kept calling then the best team in the world was hilarious
[1:26:54] najafan: Darkplace?
[1:26:55] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  I hate watching Pyosik play league so much dude
[1:27:00] holyspud_: best in show is a banger
[1:27:04] PinnxelGRP: tropic thunder is soooooooo good
[1:27:05] Noiramei: I forgot about tropic thunder
[1:27:10] commando1814: ima dude playing a dude desguised as another dude
[1:27:11] McDumps: Naked Gun was a great satirical movie.
[1:27:12] boulderthan: idiocracy
[1:27:15] L0rc4n: hot fuzz
[1:27:17] PinnxelGRP: RDJ should have won an oscar for that performance

[1:27:29] Shobes572: Cheer500 BLAZING SADDLES AND YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN
[1:27:30] CrimzsCast: I should watch naked gun
[1:27:31] Veila24: @MonteCristo what about the Cornetto Trilogy? Especifically Hot Fuzz
[1:27:32] Zebrios: Idiocracy isn't a comedy.  It's a documentary a few years too early.
[1:27:34] Fissiccisst: Spaceballs
[1:27:37] Alphz: world champion and fraud?
[1:27:37] Veila24: Oh someone brought it up alraedy lol
[1:27:45] Noiramei: another year of pyo and beryl but at least they on the same team XD
[1:27:45] najafan: How about Darkplace? I know writers who use subtext and they're all cowards.
[1:27:45] fartnugget45: Team America!
[1:27:46] Amaresu_: go further back to see how zeus set it up
[1:27:47] darthbane56: Shaun of the dead if that counts
[1:27:50] commando1814: @Shobes572 young frankenstien is phenominal
[1:27:55] guy_in_chat_says: KT got pyosik just because on certain occasions he owns T1
[1:28:00] guy_in_chat_says: and they wanted some of that
[1:28:06] madiiiman: theres an interview where jamie foxx reached out to rdj to play a hispanic man in a follow up to tropic thunder and Rdj immediately agreed lmao
[1:28:07] Fissiccisst: Police Academy
[1:28:08] Professional_Aellith: Team America: World Police
[1:28:12] AKapo89: all gene wilder is fantastic
[1:28:14] Amedrash: does galaxy quest count
[1:28:17] Shobes572: Mel brooks absolutely not a cristoCAKE
[1:28:19] dah777: yeah, that kinda sus tbh
[1:28:20] Imaslapyou: RDJ too beloved for it to be cancelled
[1:28:21] SESRoots: Twilight Kappa
[1:28:22] commando1814: no way is blazing saddles cancelable right
[1:28:27] McDumps: Think Galaxy quest should count.
[1:28:28] AR3iTeR: what do you think about Anchorman 1/2?
[1:28:29] sara15gonzalez: this game was pretty much over at first 4 mins
[1:28:30] xChip102: you think KT underperformed this series or is it just team gap?
[1:28:33] PinnxelGRP: RDJ in tropic thunder was to funny to cancel LUL
[1:28:33] CrimzsCast: The most interesting thing about this series is botlane. Interesting how t1 handled kt botside
[1:28:35] Zebrios: I watched Space Balls last night.  It's still good.
[1:28:36] soulcruncher: @Imaslapyou true he is the main reason it would be cancelled
[1:28:42] Zepz9565: they are non cancelable. they did the mockery of everything perfectly.
[1:28:54] Dreamchosis: have you seen "Top Secret!"

[1:28:56] commando1814: tim allen is fantastic
[1:29:04] McDumps: @MonteCristo Alan Rickman was so good in it.
[1:29:14] commando1814: @McDumps yes he was
[1:29:25] aggieeggs: i thought galaxy quest was startrek for a long time
[1:29:34] najafan: Blazing Saddles is sort of the exact opposite of the things that get canceled.
[1:29:35] saberaxe: Could alway do Truman Show
[1:29:36] saberaxe: as well
[1:29:40] mr_steno: not sure if Kung Fu Hustle is a parody, or just a king fu comedy - but it’s one of my favorite movies of all time.
[1:29:40] najafan: It's, uh, making fun of them.
[1:29:49] Zebrios: Nah
[1:29:51] Zebrios: Drama
[1:29:55] commando1814: @mr_steno hmmm
[1:30:01] Zepz9565: truman show is one of my faves but no
[1:30:02] rs_bennyboi: Trueman show is def a satire
[1:30:06] Zepz9565: i think its an introspective
[1:30:11] Zebrios: Jim Carrey's acting in it was actually great in it though
[1:30:15] L0rc4n: it's more of a commentary on human nature no?
[1:30:19] najafan: I mean, it has some satirical elements.
[1:30:19] Dreath1: truman show is a masterpiece is what it is
[1:30:20] squires: I wouldn't really consider it a satire. Just an existential comedy
[1:30:23] stevethekind: that is a hot take
[1:30:23] Mizzzraim: true
[1:30:24] mr_steno: @commando1814 either way, I love that movie
[1:30:24] HeySugar: WHAT
[1:30:26] rs_bennyboi: i agree on that
[1:30:29] bigtexasmoney69: it is a shame about his RL stuff
[1:30:30] Amaresu_: thats a really based take
[1:30:34] PinnxelGRP: NODDERS eternal sunshine
[1:30:38] lookakraken81: Airplane
[1:30:39] nwsoldner: Yeah those are probably his two best movies too
[1:30:39] Noiramei: Nah kickass 2 was his peak LOL
[1:30:40] kookoolau: to be honest, T1 botlane shows another champions in this game
[1:30:41] TheExperienceAwaits: I liked him on In Living Color.
[1:30:42] squires: I mean, I would still consider Truman Show a comedy
[1:30:42] commando1814: @mr_steno one of our great beers with rommates movies n college
[1:30:44] saberaxe: I just love The Mask movies from when I was a kid
[1:30:45] Zebrios: His comedy was good during his SNL era
[1:30:46] HeySugar: I won't stand for this liar liar slander
[1:30:46] madiiiman: Kappa him in sonic
[1:30:47] PinnxelGRP: @MonteCristo when are you guys watching requiem for a dream PepeLaugh
[1:30:50] Vyoz: the number 23 was his weirdest movie
[1:30:55] boulderthan: i feel the same about will smith
[1:30:56] McDumps: I like that this game is so one sided, we're talking about movies.
[1:31:04] Shobes572: @montecristo I can't believe you're sleeping on Ace Ventura
[1:31:07] fartnugget45: will smith is a bad actor period
[1:31:08] Dreath1: this game was over 12 minutes ago man
[1:31:08] mr_steno: @commando1814 one of the great “get stoned with my dad and watch” movies lol
[1:31:11] kookoolau: i think KT needs 10 bans against T1 ah LUL hahha
[1:31:19] Dreath1: KT got railed
[1:31:23] commando1814: does harold and kumar count as parady
[1:31:24] rilsolo: why did KT have to be frauds Pepehands
[1:31:31] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo if you are asked to beat T1, draft wise what would you do?
[1:31:33] Talsifer: I like how scream is a satire and scary movie is a satire of a satire
[1:31:33] squires: Mean Girls = satire? That movie's great.
[1:31:38] Zebrios: Smolder is the new Zeri monkaW
[1:31:39] boulderthan: @fartnugget45 you seen 7 pounds?
[1:31:40] commando1814: @mr_steno that was drinking and watching ther big labowski
[1:31:43] rs_bennyboi: how do i get better in understsanding drafts and what the different compositions want to do ? Could you break down KR and T1s comp and their objectives in this gamw, what they want to do
[1:31:43] Giiino: riot releasing a busted champ for a change
[1:31:43] Thorgood2: unless ur vsing viper
[1:31:45] imZenlol: elder passive ICANT
[1:31:53] PinnxelGRP: wait isnt scary movie satire?
[1:31:54] Imaslapyou: Riot will do what they always do and nerf it after everyone has spent $ to buy blue essence for it
[1:31:56] Amaresu_: idk how good it is on 14.4 probably doesnt change that much, just makes his early laning a bit more punishable.
[1:31:57] commando1814: does the big labowski count ?
[1:31:58] fartnugget45: @boulderthan yes will smith just plays will smith in everything. trash
[1:32:02] najafan: Murder by Death is pretty great parody, if you like whodunnits.
[1:32:03] kookoolau: Deft jinx is only champion that is special
[1:32:09] Phixos2: oh no not deft again PepeLaugh
[1:32:10] mr_steno: I was thinking if the Blues Brothers movies count
[1:32:14] FzeroTV: its gonna take me 6 months to learn what that champion does
[1:32:17] Zebrios: LUL
[1:32:25] commando1814: cristoLCS cristoLCS
[1:32:33] fartnugget45: will smith is like the same level as the rock. they just play themselves in everything and make a lot of money because.... reasons
[1:32:33] madiiiman: not the last time
[1:32:33] claps_121: booped again lol
[1:32:43] L0rc4n: deft when keria uses ali's abilities D:
[1:32:46] Lopseypop: Just wait PepeLaugh
[1:32:46] Noiramei: @FzeroTV 60 seconds in practice tool
[1:32:50] Amaresu_: faker and zeus are the best flankers in the world (and best sololaners in general atm)
[1:32:54] lelouch_03: whats your favorite race in warcraft 3?
[1:32:54] Dreath1: @fartnugget45 at least we know will smith can act
[1:32:55] kookoolau: dont need shockwave if u have a cow Kappa
[1:33:05] FzeroTV: @Noiramei that would require downloading the lol client
[1:33:13] Noiramei: @FzeroTV fair LOL
[1:33:18] PinnxelGRP: wow that was really bad by Bdd he just sold his entire life for vi
[1:33:22] mikejanderson: he had time to flash after the ali q
[1:33:22] McDumps: Why flash, when you can die.
[1:33:31] holyspud_: keria stunned him into punt but yeah he could flash earlier
[1:33:37] Zebrios: Filthy shadowmeld abuser
[1:33:39] MF_DLP: I saw the first 5 minutes of the first game of KT v T1 and was like "ahhh, there it is"
[1:33:39] rs_bennyboi: how do i get better in understsanding drafts and what the different compositions want to do ? Could you break down KR and T1s comp and their objectives in this gamw, what they want to do @MonteCristo
[1:33:51] fatalqwerty: Did you also feel bad when Moon lost to Grubby's Orc? FeelsBadMan
[1:33:52] kookoolau: I think Deft cannot react timely for push the flash button
[1:33:53] fartnugget45: SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc wc3
[1:33:54] najafan: @rs_bennyboi Watch LS. Kappa

[1:34:14] AdmiralReggie: yeah thats good
[1:34:17] soulcruncher: that time deft had all the time in the world to flash
[1:34:19] Zebrios: Give us elevator pitch for that movie
[1:34:24] PinnxelGRP: Children of the corn Aware
[1:34:29] saberaxe: in that case Animal Farm is always fun
[1:34:29] Dreath1: @rs_bennyboi KT wants to poke and play for picks, T1 wants to scale and play front to back
[1:34:39] Amaresu_: both comps want to front to back this game. ksante alistar gnar and wukong want to find flank angles if they can but both comps are teamfighting front to back comps. gnar can split if ahead but he s not ahead.
[1:34:41] PinnxelGRP: OH WAIT
[1:34:48] PinnxelGRP: THE DEATH OF STALIN
[1:34:51] PinnxelGRP: isnt that satire
[1:34:59] illusivephil: Iron sky
[1:35:08] najafan: Cohen Brothers are peak, yeah
[1:35:09] rs_bennyboi: how do i get better in understsanding drafts and what the different compositions want to do ? Could you break down KR and T1s comp and their objectives in this gamw, what they want to do
[1:35:20] Imaslapyou: The accents in Death of Stalin never fail to crack me up
[1:35:22] Amedrash: do you watch always sunny monte
[1:35:38] Shobes572: @rs_bennyboi he did go over it during draft phase
[1:35:43] Zebrios: You know what movie was so underrated but gets funnier over time?  The Interview
[1:35:50] kerokerogrips: are kt beating the fraud allegations?
[1:35:51] Dreamchosis: curb is golden
[1:35:52] Thorgood2: so airplane no good either?

[1:41:52] Amaresu_: so good
[1:41:54] L0rc4n: disgusting

[1:43:22] Zebrios: @MonteCristo BDD could've used his ult WAY earlier in that fight
[1:43:23] Phixos2: blg jdg was kinda low quality at the end ngl
[1:43:43] fatalqwerty: @Phixos2 better than watching KT just disintegrate like this tbh
[1:43:44] CBRTheDon: no pealing for deft either lol
[1:43:47] PinnxelGRP: BLG JDG was a shitshow but by god was it fun. JDG should have won

[1:45:00] nickis211: Faker hides the ball in various abilities

[1:46:10] thugitakhrushchev: TrollDespair Ruler
[1:46:14] jvrvilela: Hey Monte, please react to the Chovy drama with a soloQ player (Doublelift's reaction is hilarious)
[1:46:21] Amaresu_: both these teams are messy af tho
[1:46:40] Amaresu_: you can see the comparison with T1 for example who kept the roster and these teams who still need to adjust to having new players etc.
[1:47:03] Amaresu_: but at least blg played better compared to their previous loss.
[1:48:48] pandagrog: t1 still lost 1 series
[1:49:25] madiiiman: @pandagrog the first series of the split after they actually played in the offseason
[1:49:25] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM

[1:49:55] ForestPolice: mmmmm sutffing mouth sus KEKHeim
[1:50:02] pandagrog: @madiiiman just saying that the same excuse can be applyed to BLG and GenG
[1:50:03] SimplyJunJun: KDF vs Bro just happened last night and they're facing each other again tomorrow
[1:50:03] JinSoul7: @Shobes572 ty for the sub mangoFan
[1:50:04] thugitakhrushchev: TASTY
[1:50:11] thebelkman: thebelkman subscribed with Prime. 
[1:50:19] Slayra: TASTY
[1:50:31] Amaresu_: @SimplyJunJun its cause its round 2 now and its not simulated to play the reverse order etc
[1:50:34] madiiiman: @pandagrog no?
[1:50:38] madiiiman: losing several weeks in
[1:50:40] madiiiman: very different
[1:50:51] pandagrog: @madiiiman why not? both lost after long breaks
[1:50:52] Amaresu_: @SimplyJunJun the computer just does it randomly so sometimes you have repeat matches even in same weak when you re just entering round 2
[1:51:03] SimplyJunJun: @Amaresu_ ahh gotcha thanks.
[1:51:05] Amaresu_: there were back to back telecom wars last season cause of it in same weak
[1:51:06] thebelkman: yeah i had to use the prime to make you talk while eating so worth
[1:51:21] madiiiman: @pandagrog t1 had the shortest offseason of any team in the world
[1:51:21] Amaresu_: week *
[1:51:22] jvrvilela: I love eating monte while watching my dinner
[1:51:24] jvrvilela: Wait...
[1:51:29] madiiiman: they played all of worlds then did the red bull stuff
[1:51:32] Slayra: @jvrvilela HUH
[1:51:46] pandagrog: @madiiiman not a good excuse when they kept the same roster.
[1:51:49] Amaresu_: t1 scrimmed for a week before lck started xD
[1:52:09] jvrvilela: can I post an LFN fanfic?
[1:52:13] Slayra: the next T1 roster move will be faker retirement o7
[1:52:16] kerokerogrips: did you see the keria "drama"
[1:52:19] Amaresu_: i think they will win it and it wont even be close in the final
[1:52:22] madiiiman: @pandagrog dude several players admitted they didnt even play league after the red bull event for a while
[1:52:29] Xageos: yo monte did u see the replays options on tekken 8 you can jump into any moment of the replay and take control, hope one day that technology come to league
[1:52:37] madiiiman: same roster doesnt mean shit if ppl are taking a break from practice
[1:52:38] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: i don't see faker retiring anytime soon, no health issues, still performing
[1:52:55] Phixos2: well he just recovered from some wrist issues i wouldn't say no health issues
[1:53:03] Amaresu_: no matter who they play against - and i say that cause geng does not inspire confidence to me. they got their 2-1 on the back of maokai/vi no counterplay comps in week 1 after scrimming for 10x the amount of time t1 had to prep, but thats it.
[1:53:11] madiiiman: also, t1 lost a very close series to geng they cudv won. geng got put in a casket by kt
[1:53:19] pandagrog: @madiiiman so what is the reason lmao red bull? or week 1 doesnot matter? im so tired of the t1 special treatment
[1:53:39] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: that's up to him though faker would make way more money streaming, just still wants to compete
[1:53:45] SimplyJunJun: someway somehow, T1 will still end up losing to GenG
[1:53:49] madiiiman: @pandagrog holy shit, i said week 1 doesnt matter and t1 didnt practice for a while after red bull. these are not mutually exclusive statemtns
[1:54:00] madiiiman: can you not comprehend how two things are both true?
[1:54:06] madiiiman: and both play factors?
[1:54:08] Phixos2: i can see this T1 roster going the CSGO Astralis route, overcoming their choke demons and winning everything for a few years
[1:54:19] Amaresu_: @madiiiman dont bother.
[1:54:21] madiiiman: i will grant geng came off a long break vs kt. so did kt, and geng got smacked
[1:54:30] Shobes572: @madiiiman pls stop feeding the troll

[1:54:42] Amaresu_: @madiiiman you re wasting your time. some people just want to cope.
[1:54:46] imZenlol: @pandagrog this team just won worlds and y'all still talking shit like t1 is bad annoying mfs 😭
[1:54:58] Amaresu_: ^
[1:55:13] Phixos2: people like to shit on t1 fans but the t1 haters are just as bad if not worse
[1:55:23] Shobes572: @amaresu_ I like the cut of your jib
[1:55:47] imZenlol: you guys should be happy that t1 is doing good so far, because every international event against t1 is a BANGER
[1:55:51] Shobes572: Shobes572 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Amaresu_! They have given 78 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:55:51] Amaresu_: the funniest thing about this telecom war was that all it took was 1 dropped game since the first series of the split for kk0ma to come on stage and take the belt out and start the serious draft xD
[1:55:51] pandagrog: nah im just saying that when t1 loses its 5000 excuses that are made. someone is sick, they didnot pratice, week one doesnot matter ETC
[1:55:53] CrimzsCast: Caitlyn vi into Lucian, not milio for correctness
[1:55:56] Amaresu_: @Shobes572 yo thanks
[1:55:58] Slayra: all this talk in chat when NRG is gonna win worlds anyway classic
[1:56:21] Shobes572: @amaresu_ np fam
[1:56:23] Oskuheh: Oskuheh subscribed with Prime. 
[1:56:32] CrimzsCast: I like it cause you can't pick tk with Lucian
[1:56:46] kerokerogrips: @phixos2  was it t1 haters that were flaming keria for his champion picks to the point he had to took about them on stream?
[1:57:29] Phixos2: that entire keria situation was taken out of proportion you guys should not blindly follow some fan translation
[1:57:34] Slayra: teams try new picks against weaker teams to see if they work?? no way!! D:
[1:57:34] imZenlol: banger incoming Prayge
[1:57:35] CrimzsCast: Surprised karma made it through first round.
[1:58:11] Shobes572: @crimzscast Karma is a bit of a cristoCAKE
[1:58:18] SimplyJunJun: when is lpl gonna go to 14.3 i miss the drake time clock XD
[1:58:51] CrimzsCast: Idk what that means? @shobes572
[1:59:10] Amaresu_: i love lucian as a champion, both to watch and play, and he is really fun to play and actually really strong rn - even still - and players like guma viper ruler are insanely good at him but teams need to understand you cant early pick this champion in draft, especially with utility mids cause its too easy for enemy team to lock in 2 frontliners and then yo ucant play your normal game which just devalues the pick itself.
[1:59:42] Slayra: NOTED

[2:00:06] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo is suszie still in esports?
[2:00:23] CrimzsCast: Big thing this game is xin didn't invade vi lvl 1-2
[2:00:28] Amaresu_: ^
[2:00:32] Shobes572: Karma has promise of doing well with a combination of damage and utility, but often falls short on both compared to other options
[2:00:37] boulderthan: are esports players as famous  in korea as traditional sport personalities are in the us/uk?
[2:00:50] jvrvilela: @StealingYoIPZ  she went to the rap world, now she's known as Lil Susie Kappa
[2:01:02] Amaresu_: i think karma is exactly like lucian tbh
[2:01:06] marcos_vvv: n
[2:01:09] Amaresu_: few teams/players actually use her well
[2:01:12] Amaresu_: but she IS broken
[2:01:16] Shobes572: Pick a utility mid or damage mid will always perform better than Karma
[2:01:46] jvrvilela: would we every have her back on a summoning insight to tell the good old stories?
[2:01:51] jvrvilela: Ever*
[2:01:58] Amaresu_: getting hit by 2 malignance karma RQs back to back and going from full to 20% hp is not fun
[2:02:00] Shobes572: She was only hot before the Malignance proc interaction
[2:02:11] neatny: Is T1 nr 1 on your ranking?
[2:02:24] Amaresu_: but people tunnel too much on dmg especially late game. and ppl pick her with non hypercarries (talking about sololane karma in the comp not karma support pairings)
[2:02:28] PinnxelGRP: yagao flashed OMEGALUL
[2:02:41] Zepz9565: how is a 6v4 games played happening?

[2:02:51] pandagrog: i would do GenG Tes Blg T1 prob
[2:03:07] Amaresu_: i m not saying karma is 100% pick/ban tier priority etc but yeah she s not just bait pick. most teams just draft poorly with her and play her poorly.
[2:03:09] Zepz9565: blg has 6 games jdg has 4 games?
[2:03:17] Shobes572: @neatny ranking vid on YT
[2:03:22] Amaresu_: taliyah is the actual completely broken 100% pick/ban champ rn
[2:03:32] Amaresu_: she was good before she got buffed and then seraphs got buffed twice as well.

[2:04:26] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: i dont think you can put any lcs team in a power ranking
[2:04:40] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: maybe if it was a really long list
[2:04:42] majesticcchim: not even imt?
[2:04:42] PinnxelGRP: yeah monte said he made a mistake last ranking and forgot to include c9 in the top 5. its okay mistakes happen

[2:06:06] Amaresu_: @bbqftw_ flash ghost t2 boots rush + stun card to the face when enemy laner is trying to set up the gank
[2:06:26] Amaresu_: guma keria cait lux vs fq at msi o7
[2:06:36] kookoolau: milio and lucian are wrong picks, especially lucian
[2:06:43] fatalqwerty: honestly I like ad TF, it's not too strong, and needs proper team execution to pull off
[2:06:52] majesticcchim: yall really hate Massu/Busio or what
[2:06:56] Amaresu_: @fatalqwerty its .. broken completely in 4 roles mate.
[2:07:05] Amaresu_: even on 14.4
[2:07:06] kookoolau: but TF is also too greedy picks
[2:07:07] pandagrog: @Amaresu_ guma keria got blasted by Shogun Taki anything can happen
[2:07:19] fatalqwerty: @Amaresu_ it has proper counters tho
[2:07:22] Amaresu_: monte praised masu on SI etc
[2:07:27] Amaresu_: he s just saying.. they re rookies
[2:07:49] Amaresu_: @fatalqwerty damn who 's playing zed or fizz in pro play?
[2:07:59] Amaresu_: or irelia top
[2:08:04] PinnxelGRP: if 369 stayed on jdg would jdg be better than blg
[2:08:08] zen__cloud: bwipo says massu will be better than berserker by end of summer
[2:08:26] lelouch_03: do you find it baffling that valo and lol has only like 2-3 international events per year?\
[2:08:28] AntiquusTonitrus_3: And get blasted
[2:08:29] majesticcchim: yeah but chat is so eager to see them vs t1 bot lane
[2:08:35] jimbo002y: game 3 ruler catDespair
[2:08:47] ForestPolice: @MonteCristo i miss old jdg sadge
[2:09:03] Amaresu_: did you see wha happened to bro's rookie botlane vs t1 @majesticcchim
[2:09:07] Amaresu_: 13/15 plates caitlyn
[2:09:10] MansoGanzo: @ForestPolice which one? cuz last year's is not "old" jdg lol
[2:09:12] Amaresu_: thats what would happen
[2:09:22] ForestPolice: @MansoGanzo its older than this one =)
[2:09:39] monkmodemental: are the d blade purchases on jg standard now?
[2:09:46] Krethas: without changing the formats, international rivalry narratives are so doomed :(
[2:09:46] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:09:47] Amaresu_: on 1st base yeah
[2:09:49] pandagrog: 2 series jdg vs t1 all year is a crime
[2:09:49] Amaresu_: its good stats
[2:09:53] Amaresu_: for early skirmishing
[2:09:56] monkmodemental: i c
[2:10:02] jimbo002y: lpl fans really overreacted to worlds results and that screwed  lng and jdg
[2:10:19] MansoGanzo: @jimbo002y is it really an overreaction?
[2:10:26] MansoGanzo: T1 fisted the entire LPL
[2:10:31] ruiva: I miss when champions had 3 seasons
[2:10:41] jimbo002y: look at lng now, booting tarzan was a mistake
[2:10:41] pandagrog: @jimbo002y maybe LNG but JDG was mostly personal and finance issues
[2:10:46] fatalqwerty: with the formats that current regional leagues have rn, how many international tourneys can we even schedule? 🤔
[2:10:54] Noiramei: imagine all the great tournaments we could've had in the last 10 years if it wasn't for riot
[2:10:54] Malstixy_: @MansoGanzo for instance, LNG looks 10x worse without Tarzan
[2:11:02] Amaresu_: i dont necessarily want more international events tbh
[2:11:16] Amaresu_: i just want human GMing in europe and for every league to copy lck format
[2:11:30] Amaresu_: its not hard. the best format already exists. just apply it everywhere.
[2:11:43] Amaresu_: and reduce LPL teams. bottom 10 are non factors even
[2:11:53] Mizzzraim: i feel like elk and on have been kinda underwhelming this year
[2:11:56] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: riot doesn't find it economically viable to have bo3 in NA
[2:12:00] Jaja3801: why don't more to get tournaments together right now the lec and lcs could be having a battle
[2:12:27] Malstixy_: @Jaja3801 because all non riot tourneys become 4fun tourneys, then no1 wants to watch them
[2:12:31] MansoGanzo: @Malstixy_ no team looks instantly better after a longterm member leaves (see Teddy vs Guma 2021) + that's just a bad response to a justified reaction
[2:12:38] Noiramei: @bigdumbidiotmdrfkr I wonder what the floor of LCS would've been if they kept b03. Cuz the viewership died regardless of the bo1
[2:12:38] Veila24: Going to Sonic, what should I get
[2:12:59] Zepz9565: just dont
[2:13:01] lelouch_03: @Malstixy_ hard disagree with that back them we have IEM
[2:13:02] AdmiralReggie: Sonic tater tots fuck
[2:13:06] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: bacon egg toaster
[2:13:07] bigtexasmoney69: should get food from a better restaurant
[2:13:10] bigdumbidiotmdrfkr: tater tots
[2:13:11] Amaresu_: i havent watched every blg game this season but elk/on do look not to be playing their best
[2:13:15] Suga__Shane: powerade slushy
[2:13:15] Noiramei: Their 2000 calories milkshakes :D
[2:13:25] Veila24: @bigtexasmoney69 It's 11 PM bro, not many restaurants open right now
[2:13:38] Lysen: if there ain't a green chile cheeseburger idgaf
[2:13:46] Malstixy_: @lelouch_03 when was the last time IEM ran a LOL tourney for t1 leagues?
[2:13:56] Amaresu_: if Vi is not reworked by 2025.. that will be a huge failure
[2:14:05] Professional_Aellith: Get the conney dog, a large slushie, and some tots
[2:14:06] Amaresu_: biggest problem champion after maokai in the game by far.
[2:14:06] WillaFarris: lux auto on passive
[2:14:06] looknonumbers: auto
[2:14:09] Amaresu_: (and neeko)
[2:14:09] bigtexasmoney69: fair enough. I live 2 blocks from a sonic and still refuse to go. let me know if there was anything edible there and maybe ill give it a chance
[2:14:12] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Auto passive
[2:14:12] Nidsmies: PAssive + auto
[2:14:19] Camer0n000: is it just me or is the quality of the lpl bad now, if you took off nameplates these games looked the same as mad fnatic games
[2:14:29] lelouch_03: @Malstixy_ before riot introduced THE system back in 2016
[2:14:44] Amaresu_: @Camer0n000 regular season LPL is always mid
[2:14:45] kerokerogrips: dont you love league's clarity?
[2:14:51] imZenlol: I was almost excited when I saw NIP vs LNG upcoming matchup today, but LNG is kinda Aware
[2:14:51] Noobishwizard: These were banging games

[2:14:58] monkmodemental: !headphones
[2:15:05] Amaresu_: these are basically on stage scrims as far as LPL is concerned.
[2:15:07] Malstixy_: @lelouch_03 yea its been 7+ years is my point, im trying to use more recent league tourneys
[2:15:18] kerokerogrips: when is powerspike btw?
[2:15:21] Thaiestro: I'm going to a jolibee's in SD
[2:15:23] MansoGanzo: @Camer0n000 no superteams + rebuilding rosters + they've always been data-reliant, they need time to study the new meta
[2:15:26] fatalqwerty: one reason why I stopped spectating dota2, the clarity is just sooo bad
[2:15:28] bbqftw_: would anyone but middle east govts and sketchy online casinos run a third-party international tournament even if it was allowed anyways nowadays
[2:15:46] Nidsmies: Monte, who do you think is the best adc in the world atm? I kinda think Viper is doing crazy things again even tho he's being elohelled. Ruler is also doing great things but I think he's not on the same level as last year.
[2:16:04] jimbo002y: @bbqftw_ no LUL
[2:16:05] Hi_ImPhantomere: when the next global ranking update
[2:16:09] Malstixy_: @MansoGanzo Sure i agree, but they had 3 previous players who should have built in synergy, they even added WeiWei and Mark, not exactly rookies and arent able to showcase anything special
[2:16:13] Veila24: Is Trolli not sponsoring y'all anymore :( @MonteCristo
[2:16:15] lelouch_03: @Malstixy_ theres no legitemate 3rd party because the System i was talking about forbidding 3rd party to emerge from competing against a riot tourney
[2:16:41] saberaxe: right after r
[2:16:44] PinnxelGRP: it was lux auto
[2:16:54] PinnxelGRP: right AFTER R yeaH
[2:16:59] Malstixy_: yea its lux p proc
[2:17:02] saberaxe: the auto is in the air with the beam still on the screen
[2:17:21] Malstixy_: if luc flashes right before it hits him, then it dissapears
[2:17:22] ceviche_lol: autos right after r
[2:17:24] looknonumbers: go back to just before the flash and you can see it
[2:17:30] saberaxe: go back to where lux beam is still on screen
[2:17:37] L0rc4n: which sparkle are we talking about?
[2:17:58] luccid: I SAW IT
[2:18:12] Amaresu_: good answer to kill elk there from jdg
[2:18:14] saberaxe: it got lost in the dying laser beam
[2:18:16] luccid: It's right next to him before he flashed
[2:18:53] Fluffieface: @MonteCristo better than rb6. god damn peakers advantage
[2:18:54] PinnxelGRP: tbf dota is way worse, there was a TI where like 100 rats were procced by some champion and they swarmed another champion. I have no clue what I saw
[2:19:01] Amaresu_: Clap
[2:19:04] fatalqwerty: great wall of china
[2:19:17] lelouch_03: do u think that riot can replicate the success of league of legends? it seems to me they got lucky with the success
[2:19:20] HENgauw: this gentleman is slowly become iwilldominate
[2:19:23] ForestPolice: chefs kiss LuL
[2:19:25] ceviche_lol: Clap
[2:19:27] kerokerogrips: thats the lpl i like watching
[2:19:27] luccid: HUH
[2:19:31] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Is it a marcoblast or not yet
[2:19:52] jerckysminion: morning peepz
[2:19:52] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:19:54] Nidsmies: Playing lucian in this game feels so awful
[2:20:09] pandagrog: @PinnxelGRP your talking about natures prophets minions lmao
[2:20:15] Malstixy_: playing lucian def feelsbad here, but playing xin zhao against red side comp feels worse
[2:20:23] Amaresu_: i know morgana is a terrible champ rn but .. it kinda boggles the mind how we ve seen 0 morgana picks into so much vi over the last 2 years man with this champion being so broken
[2:20:39] Amaresu_: rework vi, get this poitn and click suppression out of the game.
[2:20:41] Malstixy_: @Amaresu_ thats because there are quite literally 30 better picks than morgana
[2:20:45] joeybanzo: How would you rate Yagao compared to worlds best midlanes?
[2:20:46] Nidsmies: Lucian is so strong, but with Vi R and Taliyah W makes it so frustrating if u wanna deal dmg
[2:20:55] Amaresu_: idk look what happens to ruler with vi R into taliyah combo
[2:21:04] Malstixy_: morg would not stop that
[2:21:07] Amaresu_: milio really useful with dead adc
[2:21:11] Amaresu_: are you sure abt that?
[2:21:12] Malstixy_: tali e would break black shield
[2:21:20] Malstixy_: he does not have flash or dash up
[2:21:22] Malstixy_: hesjust dead
[2:21:29] Nidsmies: Good drafting from BLG
[2:21:30] luccid: both
[2:21:31] Amaresu_: he d be dashing back/flashing back the moment vi ults him with morg black shield on him lol
[2:21:35] Eztuary: Eztuary subscribed with Prime. 
[2:21:38] Amaresu_: taliyah combo doesnt hit with black shield on vi R
[2:21:42] RoughRunner98: doesnt matter he got knocked up
[2:21:42] Nidsmies: Ruler's cleanse gets pressed but that UI is so shit lmao
[2:21:51] Malstixy_: @Amaresu_ taliyah e breaks the shield alone.
[2:21:56] Amaresu_: bro
[2:21:58] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Missing cleansed Cait trap
[2:21:58] Amaresu_: look at vi R
[2:22:01] Amaresu_: and look where taliyah is
[2:22:08] Amaresu_: taliyah combo hits cause of the vi R
[2:22:42] AntiquusTonitrus_3: So he missed played
[2:22:56] RompingRhyno: you can't cleanse during root?
[2:22:59] bunnyorangewander: you can milio ult while rooted can't you?
[2:23:01] Camer0n000: does yagao build weird this game it seemed like he did no damage
[2:23:09] Amaresu_: you cant cleanse suppression @RompingRhyno vi R is a suppression
[2:23:23] Amaresu_: there is literally no counterplay to it besides a spellshield/black shield.
[2:23:28] Amaresu_: (or stopwatch)
[2:23:32] Malstixy_: you can milio r during roots
[2:23:42] Malstixy_: just not in hard cc
[2:23:43] Amaresu_: or untargetable like fizz E/zed ult etc.
[2:23:45] battosai_gg: Kench R outplays V R
[2:23:49] Amaresu_: ^
[2:25:28] lelouch_03: i heard from a sc2 caster that the failure of the owl held back the whole esport industry
[2:25:28] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:25:33] PinnxelGRP: yeah ngl TF looks really useless in pro play from the 3 games ive seen
[2:25:40] yanya7701: oh dear
[2:25:42] SkippyPeterson: they need to move it out of LA tbh
[2:25:43] Nidsmies: I don't know if it was BLG forcing mid or JDG fucking up their lane assignments bcs it seems like Yagao lost like 30cs in the last 5mins.
[2:25:46] Amaresu_: i will be extremely surprised if in 2-3 years time max they dont merge lec and lcs.
[2:25:47] lelouch_03: i heard from a sc2 caster that the failure of the owl held back the whole esport industry is that true?
[2:25:57] fatalqwerty: imagine if LCS moved to alaska, the amount tehy'll save
[2:26:00] kerokerogrips: even then with all those Brazilians viewership only went up 4%
[2:26:19] PinnxelGRP: NODDERS i see
[2:26:22] SkippyPeterson: they need to move it  out of LA
[2:26:23] kerokerogrips: lcs living on lec raids :'(
[2:26:25] Amaresu_: and caedrels
[2:26:31] Amaresu_: who co streamed 2 weeks of lcs
[2:26:36] Mezuzza: Was LCS dying inevitable, was it Riot failing to manage it properly, or was it bad culture within the LCS and orgs overall?
[2:26:57] pandagrog: @Mezuzza both
[2:26:59] Amaresu_: its sad cause i like lcs more than lec as a product rn and it was the same last season too.
[2:27:07] Amaresu_: league is just not a big game in na
[2:27:09] RompingRhyno: @Amaresu_ i just checked and milio cleanses suppression but not airborne cc which is vi's ult
[2:27:13] Amaresu_: not just the esport but soloq wise too
[2:27:14] Gulvan: I don’t watch it anymore since CLG ain’t there
[2:27:15] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Becuz lcs is just the lowest out the 4 major region in game play
[2:27:17] yanya7701: and they are saying Markz is doing a great job bc he made it live patch that they think saved the LCS or something when in reality all hes doing is PR videos and defensive tweets of everything hes doing
[2:27:25] Malstixy_: imo LCS is dieing because the players arent interesting, the league overall isnt that good, and operating out of LA is not cheap both on Riot and LCS
[2:27:26] JoncIaude: Why does the lpl seem to be the only region that consistently values cait/lux?
[2:27:31] Amaresu_: the "meme" european server "eune" (nordic east) that nobody plays on has more players than NA
[2:27:39] PinnxelGRP: Markz is doing fine tho
[2:27:46] kerokerogrips: marks chnages were good but lcs is in a death spiral rn
[2:27:47] Fluffieface: becasue we know we are never winning works
[2:27:51] Amaresu_: @RompingRhyno yeah vi R is a combo of suppression into knockup
[2:27:54] Camer0n000: i was only going to watch the lcs to see c9 dominate but they arent even good so i have no reason to watch
[2:27:54] yanya7701: *hes doing nothing
[2:27:55] Shadowdr3y: I've heard this "LCS is dying" since I got into the scene last year. Is there anyway to salvage it?
[2:27:57] Noiramei: it's a fragile lane
[2:28:01] pandagrog: @Malstixy_ players are interesting though, this year proves that
[2:28:17] Amaresu_: they will combine it with cblol by next year for sure
[2:28:23] Malstixy_: @pandagrog compared to LCK or LPL players not really
[2:28:25] Amaresu_: but i dont think it ll save it
[2:28:29] RodrigoWrok: theyre kind of doing it with academy
[2:28:31] Amaresu_: i think down the line they ll combine lec and lcs
[2:28:34] RompingRhyno: @Amaresu_ no mention of vi ult having suppression on the wiki
[2:28:37] Amaresu_: like in 3 years lets say
[2:28:42] Malstixy_: no shot
[2:28:42] pandagrog: @Malstixy_ i mean no shit lol. thats a lofty expectation.
[2:28:52] yanya7701: but that would make NA even worse, which will drag down their viewership even more
[2:29:00] sebsonfiregg: whats the main reason behind its decline?
[2:29:02] luccid: ruler flashed ICANT
[2:29:03] aces817: the ruler flash lol
[2:29:10] Malstixy_: @pandagrog but LCS had that level of player popularity prior, its not as if they never had it to begin with
[2:29:13] Krethas: I wonder if thereis  any value to other regions that LCS is on live patch, in terms of planning future strategies. Or perhaps the quality of play is just not high enough to reference
[2:29:25] Slayra: if an LCS team wins worlds the viewership will increase. easy solution YEP
[2:29:29] Veila24: Wouldn't that kill CBOL though? Like adding a dying parasite to a healthy body. It may prolong the parasite's life giving it a new host to feed on, but it's gonna weaken the host body
[2:29:32] luccid: Ruler wants OUT lol
[2:29:56] ax_ell: Uncharacteristic of ruler
[2:30:01] aces817: fat fingered d when he meant to e?
[2:30:03] Amaresu_: @luccid wait till you see the kaisa game
[2:30:15] pandagrog: @Malstixy_ Popularity is different from interest. But i get what you mean.
[2:30:22] Amaresu_: even the best fat finger misclick i guess
[2:30:31] Amaresu_: true

[2:30:32] Amaresu_: and based.
[2:30:33] aces817: trueee
[2:30:35] SkippyPeterson: tru
[2:30:36] Nidsmies: @ax_ell That was the "Ruler moment" lite
[2:30:42] luccid: BASED I use it on d
[2:30:44] ceviche_lol: f=flash
[2:30:45] taconuva1: as an adc with 1 brain cell who has flash on D, you are objectively correct
[2:30:46] Lamynator: gotta keep flash close to you, d is better
[2:30:51] Goatsguffle: Where can I see these low LCS numbers
[2:30:56] BKrisz: slander, d is for dlash
[2:30:56] thugitakhrushchev: NOPERS Wrong
[2:31:00] RodrigoWrok: F missing
[2:31:18] saberaxe: flandre walking into a trap
[2:31:30] saberaxe: that he flashed away from already
[2:31:42] yanya7701: exactly its so pathetic
[2:31:49] kerokerogrips: mo4ale
[2:31:58] kerokerogrips: morale for the troops
[2:32:04] Amaresu_: they re doing it cause most non hardcore ppl want read the es charts stuff but their own pr will get to them
[2:32:04] Fissiccisst: Its almost like being the worst region consistently ever single year impacts people's enthusiasm
[2:32:04] shootmyfaceoff: why lcs hate boner when lec viewership is down too
[2:32:04] lelouch_03: if lcs collapse entirely will this collapse the riot esport ecosystem to?
[2:32:07] homelander369: This series is gonna ruin the viewing experience for lec spring split
[2:32:09] Amaresu_: standard practice in pr really
[2:32:11] Amaresu_: these days
[2:32:11] Gulvan: it’s what a content creator does, just alternative facts
[2:32:12] saberaxe: he walked into a trap then got binded and trapper again
[2:32:15] yanya7701: Markz is treating the job of a commissioner as a content creator ICANT
[2:32:20] Amaresu_: we re in post truth era of fake news after all
[2:32:20] wale_lol: wouldnt knowing if viewrship is actually down require knowing what % of viewers were non-USA in the before group?
[2:32:23] taconuva1: @lelouch_03 nah kr and china way too big
[2:32:23] Amaresu_: so companies just embracei t
[2:32:26] Amaresu_: to gaslight
[2:32:51] RodrigoWrok: oof the headshot dmg
[2:32:54] wale_lol: we know many viewers currently are non-US, but to say it is actually down requires knowing the % that were non-US before
[2:32:59] Camer0n000: how would you feel if the lcs or any lol leagues sold exclusive streaming rights to twitch or youtube
[2:33:11] Gulvan: don’t worry Monte, they’ll hire the former savior of EG to lead LCS next
[2:33:15] Fissiccisst: @wale_lol monte LITERALLY just said they have the data that shows its mostly non-us
[2:33:20] Amaresu_: @wale_lol the comparison is obvious when you look at the lec host + caedrel costream even inspite of the baianos costream
[2:33:22] taconuva1: @Camer0n000 this is what they were trying to do years ago and fucked it up, would have been a huge revenue potential
[2:33:26] Nidsmies: It's kinda frustrating that it's accepted by companies to misslead us by manipulating the data they release. Or just blatantly lie ie. Apple's video about iPhone 15 and the new tech in it.
[2:33:45] wale_lol: @Fissiccisst monte literally just referred to the non-US % currently, and if you read what i said then youll understand
[2:33:49] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies yup
[2:34:01] yanya7701: @Nidsmies you literally only need to look at the official stream number and its literally the same as last split
[2:34:04] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies eu is the only org trying to push back but its too late now
[2:34:14] Fluffieface: at least
[2:34:19] JoncIaude: Is there any world where tf csn split here?
[2:34:27] im_moyo: is there something you think LCS could be doing better or what?
[2:34:35] Amaresu_: which is sad cause lcs is actually a lot better both as a product and to some extent in terms of gameplay this season
[2:34:40] rhjf: even hotline league gets 40-60% less viewers than it use to
[2:34:52] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ I think it's not "too late" just yet, but it's getting difficult.
[2:34:54] Amaresu_: but its just too late after many years of terrible gameplay and bad formats etc
[2:34:59] Amaresu_: and league is just dead in na
[2:35:06] Amaresu_: not just the esport but the game itself
[2:35:11] yanya7701: @Amaresu_ how is it better? The product's 99% about the gameplay
[2:35:28] Fissiccisst: Worst part is the casters have to smile and pretend like nothing is wrong lol
[2:35:30] luccid: do something JDG PoroSad
[2:35:48] kerokerogrips: arcane was a lightning in a bottle moment to have introduce the game to so many people
[2:35:48] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:35:49] Amaresu_: @yanya7701 it is better cause its not just c9 fisting everyone and there s new players with good mechanics coming in etc.
[2:35:51] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ The gameplay part I disagree. There is a lot of parity atm which makes it kinda hype but the gameplay isn't too hot.
[2:35:54] RodrigoWrok: headshot 50% dmg
[2:35:57] Amaresu_: 2 less bottom feeder orgs in it as well etc
[2:36:08] yanya7701: @Amaresu_ thats bc C9 got just as sht as the other teams lmao
[2:36:17] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies lec gameplay has been worse entire split barring the final
[2:36:18] AdmiralReggie: monkaS
[2:36:32] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ The orgs that left weren't both bottom feeders though lol
[2:36:46] taconuva1: If Riot wasn't trying to run LCS on as low a budget as possible to keep it successful as a marketing exercise and actually wanted to make it a strong broadcast they would do like an Inside the NBA type broadcast with a cast of the most OG NA players and casters possible, it'll never happen but I wish it would
[2:36:47] Amaresu_: yeah but when it comes to roster building theres less slots for players
[2:36:48] squires: Good luck engaging into Cait, Lux, Taliyah even with a tank
[2:36:55] Amaresu_: so the bad players get phased out for the most part
[2:37:04] Amaresu_: ofc you have players like revenge/licorice not getting a team but yeah
[2:37:19] RodrigoWrok: flandre monkaW
[2:37:39] AdmiralReggie: gg
[2:37:40] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ I've got to disagree with you. It had a bit more "happy gaming" but the overall level on top 4 teams is still higher.
[2:37:41] imZenlol: gg
[2:37:48] SoulSnorlax: gg
[2:37:50] dah777: hwei checking brush with his long range?
[2:37:52] yanya7701: @Amaresu_ 8 teams is so weird. I agree the bad players are out part. But the problem is the players left are not rly better lol
[2:37:52] Fioraoraoraoraoraoraora: nothing lucian can do
[2:38:00] thugitakhrushchev: I really dont understand the TF top here.
[2:38:04] kerokerogrips: how come spellbool doesnt get used anymore?
[2:38:14] Jeffp2662: ksante always look so strong in pro. It's crazy to me he's not perma ban
[2:38:15] Amaresu_: @yanya7701 idk man, players like sniper masu and more are exciting
[2:38:33] madiiiman: too little too late
[2:38:34] Amaresu_: its because of many years in a row of it being terrible and the game dying in NA
[2:38:37] Amaresu_: its not just the esport
[2:38:43] Amaresu_: the game itself - soloq - is not growing in na
[2:38:49] majesticcchim: god damn these younglings and their Fortnite
[2:38:54] kerokerogrips: arcane was a major fumble in terms of converting viewers to players
[2:38:55] yanya7701: @Amaresu_ are they? They are not the reason why their teams are winning
[2:38:55] lazink: It's an old game
[2:38:56] Amaresu_: americans just want to play fortnite and valorant more
[2:39:05] Respect_Dat1: TSM actually did have a lot of fans.. totally forgot lmfao
[2:39:07] Camer0n000: i live in canada and i only know of like 3 people that play league other than me
[2:39:10] theUGOTUGOT: the have the most phony casting and bo1s are meh.
[2:39:14] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ They are more exciting, that's true. They kinda are the players that EU has been getting from the ERL's almost every year though.
[2:39:21] MorghynFae: Yeah, just talk with any casual gamers that you know. Ask them about LoL. Majority of the time, all they know is that it's super toxic.
[2:39:24] zen__cloud: league is really hard to get into as a new player/viewer
[2:39:32] Fissiccisst: I think the fact that everything was always for naught cause LCS always got dumpstered the moment they fought real teams in worlds killed all viewership. Every game just feels pointless when you know it'll translate to nothing once they leave the kiddie pool
[2:39:35] Crushzilla: i liked NA league back when there were big personalities and stuff. don't really care about the champions LUL
[2:39:41] Nidsmies: I think it just feels more exciting bcs nothing has been happening in the region a part from Jojo coming in in the last 3 years.
[2:39:47] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies but erl players have been terrible in eu. like this season you have myrwn and alvaro as welcome positive surprises but thats it.
[2:39:48] dazantaz: bin is just such a good player
[2:40:04] lelouch_03: is it because they killed the interest by removing personalities
[2:40:15] yanya7701: @zen__cloud thats just wrong, League is the easiest MOBA to get into ever. Way easier than the ones like Dota and all the Warcraft RPGs
[2:40:23] vlagori: HYPERBIN GIGA GIGA
[2:40:30] AntiquusTonitrus_3: So true I saty up for lck and lpl
[2:40:33] Amaresu_: being the easiest moba to get into doesnt mean its easy to get into
[2:40:36] majesticcchim: @lelouch_03 no league just has a lot of competitors in NA
[2:40:40] Amaresu_: league is a terrible new player experience
[2:40:41] bigtexasmoney69: c9 debut and next season were peak LoL
[2:40:50] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Yike, Flakked, Adam, Elyoya, Vetheo
[2:40:50] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:40:53] rhjf: its weird to think immortals is pretty legacy in terms of time in the league now
[2:40:57] CrimzsCast: I'm back what did I miss?
[2:41:01] dazantaz: LEC branding, players and content is also war superior
[2:41:07] dazantaz: way*
[2:41:10] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Just to name a few from the last 3-4 years.
[2:41:14] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies yeah out of those 2 are frauds btw. and el yoya is from like 2 years ago
[2:41:17] Thaiestro: I miss ogn and their S-tier marketing of their players and as a travel product to Korea
[2:41:21] AntiquusTonitrus_3: If I don't I watch the vods after work for lck lpl
[2:41:23] carnivalnights: Reddit tried to argue with me that NA LCS is like college football, it's not the best but it's still great to watch.
[2:41:33] yanya7701: @Amaresu_ then thats just a problem with NA players cant play MOBA. If you still want this category of games to exist, it is the easiest one
[2:41:41] battosai_gg: NA LCS is like the joke league called Big 3
[2:41:45] RodrigoWrok: how is the game not over yet? :')
[2:41:52] rollersox: i feel like EU is more like cfb, NA is just a joke kekw
[2:41:52] Amaresu_: nah its not a problem for na alone that league is a terrible new player experience
[2:41:57] Shriez: I want LCS to be good, but after this many years its hard to tune in even when I have time, rather watch better League
[2:41:59] lelouch_03: Do you consider South Korea the birthplace of esport or a Pioneer?
[2:42:01] squires: It's obviously bad if one of the major regions collapses, but hopefully it leads to a super league or more focus on tournements.
[2:42:05] Amaresu_: its not the only reason why league isnt growing in na
[2:42:11] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Who do you think are the frauds there? They might not all be in top 3 in their roles, but top 5-6 is completely respectable.
[2:42:18] Amaresu_: similar to UK for example, they re just more into console games and fifa and stuff
[2:42:19] oneifbyland: @carnivalnights i mean college sports in general i think. it's literally very talented amateurs vs. actual pros
[2:42:26] Slayra: long ass game Bedge
[2:42:29] Amaresu_: na just .. want to play fortnite and stuff rn thats about it
[2:42:29] CrimzsCast: They just poke and pressure, don't need to fight or engage.
[2:42:32] RodrigoWrok: right, makes sense
[2:42:35] yanya7701: @Amaresu_ what do you mean "terrible new player experience"?
[2:42:44] Nidsmies: JDG is staying in it surprisely well tho
[2:42:47] CrimzsCast: Siege and no fight is win
[2:42:50] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies adam is a juggernaut otp inflated fraud playing vs bad players in his position for years now.
[2:42:51] rollersox: games 2 and 3 are better :D
[2:43:01] pandagrog: @Amaresu_ NA is very much a reactionary culture in terms of what is popular to play
[2:43:22] RodrigoWrok: monkaW
[2:43:25] yanya7701: why is Kanavi there instead of the baron pit???
[2:43:28] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies for years only alphari has been a good toplaner in europe. now we have irrelevant and myrwn sure but up to now there was nobody to expose him. ppl just let him pick his cringe juggernaut picks and pick bad champs into it either blind or counter and run into him and int.
[2:43:35] dnddoctore: Lcs focuses more on name brand players rather than skilled players n make them a name brand
[2:43:43] oneifbyland: @yanya7701 lmfao i was gonna say. he had flash and smite and chases TF instead XD
[2:44:01] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Adam was like that, but after Worlds he very much leveled up his gameplay. He's kinda a dick though, but actually a decent player this year so far.
[2:44:02] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies the other is flakked. he s not useless but he s not an actual carry.
[2:44:16] CrimzsCast: The one issue with getting soul. Is the elder
[2:44:16] Mizzzraim: you would never see stuff like this in the west
[2:44:27] yanya7701: but he can flash from the top of the baron right?
[2:44:35] Amaresu_: he s been trying to play meta picks and not being completely terrible at them, i ll give him that but still unless you re playing vs myrwn or irrelevant its not like you re being contested.
[2:44:49] Amaresu_: like look at wunder man. udyr ksante only..
[2:44:56] Amaresu_: does that .. challenge you in any way?
[2:44:58] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ To me Flakked is an good peace to plug in a team. If he's top 2 carry in EU, then EU is in trouble.
[2:45:03] Amaresu_: look at odoamne this split..
[2:45:04] yanya7701: wtf is that dmg
[2:45:08] luccid: gg
[2:45:09] Amaresu_: does that challenge him in any way?
[2:45:09] xonsa: MIA where you go?
[2:45:12] RodrigoWrok: missing blowed up OMEGALUL
[2:45:16] Fissiccisst: When will they make a boomer team of 20-30s people who aren't literal children and will remember what to do during a game?
[2:45:36] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ I think Wunder was perfectly fine this year, specially early on he was very solid. Just that the team kinda imploded and he had nothing he could to with Jankos.
[2:45:39] Om1nous: @Fissiccisst I would watch that.
[2:45:40] madiiiman: im sad we dont have the "Hope is Missing" lane anymore xd
[2:45:45] Amaresu_: classic cait combo
[2:45:53] yanya7701: and E?

[2:46:19] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies i think the worst player on heretics this entire split not just playoffs was jankos but this community hates perkz too much to admit it.
[2:46:20] jerckysminion: timing :p
[2:46:20] RodrigoWrok: headshot does 70% of his life geez
[2:46:29] CrimzsCast: Omg the prefect flush too
[2:46:34] Amaresu_: but wunders inability and refusal to play carries is a big problem too.
[2:46:37] CrimzsCast: Flank*
[2:46:38] SoulSnorlax: GoldPLZ
[2:46:45] luccid: poor Flandre BibleThump
[2:46:59] thugitakhrushchev: Still dont understand the TF top pick here
[2:47:01] UrbanGeographer: wait for the game 3, you're in for a real banger there
[2:47:08] Amaresu_: this game would ve ended by 25 mins if kanavi wasnt on xin
[2:47:10] nautcholibre: @montecristo trying to assemble some ikea furniture, have an horror stories about putting together furniture with the wife ?
[2:47:11] RodrigoWrok: painful to be jdg there
[2:47:14] Slayra: Flandre pov Despairge
[2:47:16] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ I kinda don't get the Perkz hate lol. It's stupid. This past split was the 1st one where I kinda can see him not playing too well.
[2:47:18] AdmiralReggie: Clap
[2:47:27] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies exactly.
[2:47:32] CrimzsCast: The Cait looking nasty
[2:47:46] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies its just narratives fed to normies by terrible content creators/casters etc
[2:47:52] ForestPolice: lmfao
[2:47:52] luccid: D:
[2:47:55] nautcholibre: holy crap!!!
[2:47:59] xonsa: thats a shit tonne
[2:48:01] Amaresu_: thats kinda insane
[2:48:03] Charca773: how do you get that stat even
[2:48:03] ForestPolice: thats a lot of wood KEKW
[2:48:06] BeitNowKnown: wow
[2:48:07] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Yeah
[2:48:07] taconuva1: @nautcholibre my wife is the one who usually leads because i'm a dumb idiot who can barely use a screwdriver
[2:48:09] Fissiccisst: 1% ground up, and turned into pressed sawdust wood for crappy furniture lol
[2:48:09] CrimzsCast: I don't have a reference for that fact
[2:48:11] jerckysminion: only 1% i thought it be more tbh
[2:48:13] AndrasMan01: "Lego like Instructions are said" someone in chat
[2:48:28] AndrasMan01: *are hard
[2:48:33] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies when perkz came back from C9 he was fisting caps every time they played in lane and was one of the most lane dominant midlaners in lec.
[2:48:43] redsevn: some people don't do well with visual-only instructions
[2:48:46] UrbanGeographer: Ya they didnt show the draft during the live stream
[2:48:52] redsevn: also i had an ikea instruction manual that literally just had a page missing
[2:49:03] redsevn: so i fucked up a drawer because it was straight up missing instructions
[2:49:04] VanidarD: google chrome is so shit, I switched to firefox like a year ago and never looked back
[2:49:04] jerckysminion: @redsevn happens a lot tbh
[2:49:10] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies meanwhile.. community sentiment: wow caps is goat and perkz has been shit since 2019.. hm.. meanwhile perkz got c9 to quarters while caps hasnt even played a knockout series internationally since.
[2:49:20] Nidsmies: And there's a factory in Finland that emits 2% of the whole countrys carbon emissions alone.
[2:50:12] Amaresu_: nami is a lot better than milio vs vi and so is taliyah
[2:50:25] Amaresu_: wave + taliyah e/w vs vi
[2:50:40] CrimzsCast: Taliyah tf nocturne cmonnnn
[2:50:45] stevizzle34: better engage with rell too?
[2:51:14] bunnyorangewander: what do you think of hwei in pro so far?
[2:51:15] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:51:18] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Caps is great and kinda has been the goat the past two years. We don't need to make it a stupid dicotomy on Perkz is the best and Caps is worse. The narratives on Perkz being bad have been idiotic and I couldn't agree with them if my life depended on it.
[2:51:23] Amaresu_: the only worry for this jdg comp is frontline being only rell with ad tf top but .. if they play well they have the tools to do whatever they want anyway
[2:51:33] CrimzsCast: They can hard win 3vs3 with rell engage
[2:51:33] Amaresu_: if you re gonna have a 1 man frontline rell is your champ anyway
[2:51:58] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies i m not saying caps hasnt been the best player in the league by far this split
[2:52:04] Wisherex: pantheon nocturne tf ungabunga gank comp was so funny back in the day
[2:52:20] lelouch_03: Im starting to wonder why the west can't comepete against the east in league meanwhile they have atleast one world championship in starcraft usually dominated by koreans
[2:52:22] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies but he s slumped about as much as perkz has since 2019 g2 and the sentiment for the 2 is so wildly opposite its crazy
[2:52:29] CrimzsCast: @wisherex still is
[2:52:41] jerckysminion: understandable
[2:52:44] Amaresu_: twitch needs live rewind ala youtube
[2:52:57] CalmOnMe: youtube notifications is way better
[2:52:57] madiiiman: ill have nobody left to pretend to moderate
[2:52:58] Amaresu_: youtube is just better for watching esports/live streams
[2:52:59] jerckysminion: youtube is the superior platform for quality
[2:53:02] Amaresu_: all twitch has is chat
[2:53:10] madiiiman: i will never leave twitch
[2:53:10] Professional_Aellith: YouTube is easier to rewind and watch, and most AdBlockers still work there
[2:53:12] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_  Dw mate, I got it. I guess winning kinda makes people biased towards the winner.
[2:53:15] rhjf: i see ur live from youtube than come here to chat since im not on twithc otherwise
[2:53:16] smithpw: smithpw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! YT Life when possible :)
[2:53:19] madiiiman: ill make you stream on here forever
[2:53:20] Slayra: boomers Aware
[2:53:24] jerckysminion: my name on youtube is taken so i shall stay here :p
[2:53:31] Mr_Something__: I prefer YouTube for the live podcasts because it allows for pausing while I work
[2:53:32] redsevn: am i just dumb or is it basically impossible to find youtube's live streaming channels?
[2:53:39] jerckysminion: unless that one dude decides to ever delete or sell his
[2:53:44] redsevn: like i tried finding a Ludwig stream that i knew was happening and i literally couldn't find it
[2:53:46] beluga_12_3: I'm twitch until the bitter end
[2:53:47] IgonnaBe3: there is not much chat interaction on podcasts i feel like, YT has better discoverability i feel like right now although streams are still kind of weird on yt
[2:53:47] serkaine: Wh
[2:53:52] BrownSugarIsBae: youtube needs to fix its UI and chat and "live now" and basic livestream stuff and it will take over the space.
[2:54:10] meatballblastero: there's a free membership thing on youtube now if you have youtube premium. they just arent advertising it yet
[2:54:11] SoulSnorlax: GoldPLZ  󠀀
[2:54:18] stephcurrysim: how are there so many perkz apologists in chat hahaha yall goat been washed for years just accept reality, the stress of fighting a losing battle ain't good for your blood pressure
[2:54:22] jerckysminion: monte not maximizing profit sigh
[2:54:30] taconuva1: Youtube members get uncensored Korean fellatio, obviously
[2:54:31] Talsifer: Watching twitch management not improve the site at all with the lead they've had in the industry is like watching riot ruin league esports
[2:54:32] CalmOnMe: @stephcurrysim no one cares lil bro
[2:54:47] jerckysminion: LUL
[2:54:54] CrimzsCast: @montecristo it's called whaling
[2:54:59] CrimzsCast: It's a sport
[2:55:01] jerckysminion: i am the ballance offsetter
[2:55:11] Nidsmies: @stephcurrysim We're discussing about the narratives around players not being reasonable. If that's being an apologist, count me in 5/5 times.
[2:55:27] Amaresu_: @stephcurrysim after all i ve said on this, perkz should just retire now. it wont get better and g2 is just not catchable with any roster. so there s no point in "competing" if you cant win even if he wasnt washed. but THIS season, he s been washed yes. my problem is with people saying he s been washed  for 2-3 years when it was just not the case then.
[2:55:47] Talsifer: LUL
[2:55:48] Nidsmies: Lol
[2:55:53] stephcurrysim: 4 time nba champion steph curry? what he need apologising for?
[2:55:53] jerckysminion: called out !
[2:55:56] Nidsmies: LUL
[2:55:57] taconuva1: Steph is still good!! Klay on the other hand...
[2:55:57] stephcurrysim: what point do you think you just made
[2:56:20] stephcurrysim: amen
[2:56:20] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:56:29] CrimzsCast: I think if perkz stayed in Na he would've rested his laurels and probably win a few titles
[2:56:33] Amaresu_: thats my point
[2:56:40] Nidsmies: That's the whole point lol
[2:56:46] Amaresu_: my issue was with ppl saying shit that wasnt true about him last season and season before that.
[2:56:52] Amaresu_: this season.. just retire. its time.
[2:56:54] Amaresu_: same for jankos too.
[2:56:56] Amaresu_: and wunder.
[2:56:56] jerckysminion: @CrimzsCast so much like steph curry LUL
[2:56:56] AndrasMan01: EU wife debuf is real
[2:57:00] Hello665: steph did choke that 3-1 lead tho
[2:57:04] CalmOnMe: Steph is arguing with a chatter that doesnt exist while everyone else was having a discussing lmao
[2:57:08] VanidarD: its been sad to see, but I was especially sad about Jankos
[2:57:13] Amaresu_: jankos was 5x worse than perkz and wunder this split CAUGHT
[2:57:24] IgonnaBe3: guys jankos had like 3-6 bad games, lets remember that last season he was carrying with vetheo
[2:57:25] jjaypes: Was Perkz last successful appearance when he was on C9?
[2:57:27] VanidarD: he legit was in the convo for best jungler last year, and this year has just been bad so far
[2:57:45] l0unes: i came here to apologies to monte i thought you were bit unfair to kt but you were Absolutely right
[2:57:52] CrimzsCast: @jjaypes his best look in a while
[2:58:09] Lyghtsaber: @jjaypes and only spring of 2020
[2:58:15] jerckysminion: @l0unes everytime u really believe in KT they will destroy your hope n dreams with soul crushing disaster
[2:58:21] IgonnaBe3: i do wonder what happened to the whole team, like i just refuse to believe that heretics are suddenly all washed
[2:58:41] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo which players do you hate on kt?
[2:58:46] ZeddicusDarkryder: ZeddicusDarkryder subscribed with Prime. 
[2:58:46] jerckysminion: as a true KT fan i shall never not support KT but i also know they are frauds n will let me down
[2:58:48] Thaiestro: Just like my bruins
[2:58:49] Amaresu_: KDF vs KT bo5 in playoffs will BANG
[2:59:02] mobalord: "overwatch will kill lol"
[2:59:08] Talsifer: Still confused about score being jobless
[2:59:09] Amaresu_: bulldog bull cuzz and dudu will expose them even further
[2:59:14] CrimzsCast: Apparently Monte only understand money as his love language
[2:59:18] Wisherex: ah yes, the indulgences angle
[2:59:22] Amaresu_: xD
[2:59:28] Amaresu_: how does that quote even make sense
[2:59:31] Amaresu_: shooter vs moba
[2:59:32] itzgboi: @MonteCristo fav ow player?
[2:59:39] VanidarD: Xun is a menace KEKW
[2:59:56] itzgboi: FISSURE GIGACHAD
[2:59:56] jerckysminion: profit ez
[2:59:57] boostmelpay: "when you expect nothing from kt, they suddenly win a teamfight and give you false hope"
[3:00:07] bbqftw_: what were your favorite SCBW series
[3:00:14] jerckysminion: jjonak
[3:00:17] juntzj: leave is my fav
[3:00:17] Nidsmies: @Amaresu_ Game vs game, computers, viewers or something. I cannot decide on what mental gymnastics I need to cope with that.
[3:00:19] lelouch_03: did owl failure held back the whole industry in ur opinion
[3:00:20] eatmyplis: worth?
[3:00:21] CrimzsCast: Topside lead is good and all but losing Caitlin lux lane is gg
[3:00:25] pandagrog: JJonak and SSB where my favs
[3:00:26] Hello665: who you guys think is winning msi gen g?
[3:00:27] Amaresu_: i bet xun is really itching for LPL to get on 14.4 to play some nidalee.
[3:00:27] meatballblastero: that x-cow guy
[3:00:38] Amaresu_: @Nidsmies xD
[3:00:39] VanidarD: I did like Jjonak honestly, but I also only watched overwatch at the start, when he was dominating
[3:00:47] Respect_Dat1: xqc ADHD
[3:00:52] itzgboi: @MonteCristo thoughts on carpe?
[3:00:58] pris3251: was sinatra good?
[3:01:07] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo as a jungler its ok to int sometimes, you see it the same with kanavi, its just the nature of the role
[3:01:10] Talsifer: White white haired Winston player was pretty good
[3:01:11] jerckysminion: sinaatra was great but also bad at times
[3:01:20] jerckysminion: he was a very up n down player

[3:01:25] Amaresu_: its collapse probably had an effect in overall VC not investing as much in esports tho no?
[3:01:32] CrimzsCast: The failures were the fake numbers orgs generated
[3:01:52] Hello665: xfl failed that didnt effect the nfl
[3:01:53] jerckysminion: ofc who doesn't like 20-30 million $ being pushed into a game that literally failed
[3:01:54] Amaresu_: obviously the massive mismanaging of vc funds in league itself has a big part to play in that but yeah
[3:02:02] itzgboi: is the dpei shoulder checking story real lmfao
[3:02:04] jerckysminion: 20-30 million $ a team
[3:02:12] MF_DLP: @MonteCristo the four Horse Man episode was such a banger
[3:02:17] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo as a jungler its ok to int sometimes, you see it the same with kanavi, its just the nature of the role ...
[3:02:20] pandagrog: the first years of OWL was so damn cool man brought me back to when i first discovered league esports
[3:02:21] Amaresu_: yeah thats the bigger part
[3:02:22] jerckysminion: only for it to flop totally viewership wise was very impactfull for VC & mediarights
[3:02:24] Amaresu_: the media rights part
[3:02:32] Phixos2: the crab troller jdg there, ate a lot of taliyah's dmg lol
[3:02:39] rhjf: what happened to bamtech
[3:02:40] MF_DLP: Harris was such a great guest
[3:02:41] Amaresu_: perfect fight for lucian there
[3:02:42] VanidarD: the failure of OWL was for sure not as bad for the industry, like the collapse of CGS
[3:02:44] Amaresu_: he just gets to clean up
[3:02:55] jerckysminion: exactly someone would of gotten it
[3:02:56] Talsifer: @montecristo you may be right, but it did give us all that hilarious ow content from Richard Lewis
[3:03:04] Amaresu_: wtf is knight doing there even xD
[3:03:07] VanidarD: but the industry was also smaller back then and more vulnerable
[3:03:21] lazink: Bamtech or whatever that MLB deal was, hurt a lot too
[3:03:25] Amaresu_: he just baited his entire team into a terrible fight and flashed IN the pit as hwei as if he d live xD
[3:03:27] jerckysminion: @VanidarD the industry was at it's peak at that point not smaller lmao
[3:03:40] rhjf: what happened to bamtech anyway
[3:03:42] jerckysminion: the industry is literally entering a winter period where plenty of orgs will die
[3:03:44] CrimzsCast: Has to poke of course!
[3:03:44] mikejanderson: wait what is he actually doing
[3:03:45] Amaresu_: brainfart by knight for sure
[3:03:47] Fissiccisst: that Nami bubble murdered
[3:03:49] mikejanderson: that was crazy
[3:03:49] Fissiccisst: Elk*
[3:03:54] Amaresu_: yeah
[3:03:59] VanidarD: @jerckysminion I mean, that was before league, sure starcraft was big, but not as big as 2016 lol for example
[3:04:11] CrimzsCast: Team call to collapse bot tri I bet
[3:04:23] Amaresu_: i get he wants barrier for lane pressure as cait lux
[3:04:27] VanidarD: I mean, CGS was in 2007
[3:04:29] Mizzzraim: there will be a replay
[3:04:29] Amaresu_: but do you really need it to beat lucian nami
[3:04:30] jerckysminion: 2016 was peak VC capital coming in my friend
[3:04:32] Amaresu_: he needs cleanse this game
[3:04:37] Amaresu_: elk i mean
[3:04:37] HeySugar: he gets all out'd
[3:04:42] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo as a jungler its ok to int sometimes, you see it the same with kanavi, its just the nature of the role ---
[3:04:47] Respect_Dat1: lmfao they just show his corpse
[3:04:51] VanidarD: that was also pre fincancial collapes and subprime mortgage crisis
[3:04:55] Talsifer: 2016 money started coking in, the money kept coming in till like 2019
[3:04:58] jerckysminion: it was literally all the VC orgs pushing so hard they inflated prices of players & the market that it was insane
[3:05:00] Slayra: ksantemaker
[3:05:00] CrimzsCast: Kill Flandre 100 times jdg still win
[3:05:04] Talsifer: Coming*
[3:05:14] VanidarD: @jerckysminion I mean the CGS in 2007 mate, not start of OWL
[3:05:28] CrimzsCast: Flandre already perfected dieing for the team to win
[3:05:30] Amaresu_: yup
[3:05:34] Amaresu_: he thinks he s him but he sn ot
[3:05:35] VanidarD: when CGS died it was a big blow for esports, especially counterstrike
[3:05:43] Amaresu_: he saw the zeus ad tf video on youtube and thought he s him xD
[3:05:52] saberaxe: Watching Flandre makes me sad
[3:05:53] Respect_Dat1: yeah well if ksante wasnt so broken it would've been fine Kappa
[3:05:56] jerckysminion: CGS flopped mostly due to some idiot stealing around 20 million $ in funds n fleeing to the carabian also while having burned the entire rest of the budget in 1 single season
[3:06:09] serkaine: What are your favorite nicknames twitch chat has for players? For example, On is called Off when he feeds
[3:06:19] IEatLamas: Was Flandre in EU before?
[3:06:20] saberaxe: That could of been The Shy atleast would add 10x the amount of entertainment
[3:06:21] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[3:06:22] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo as a jungler its ok to int sometimes, you see it the same with kanavi, its just the nature of the role .
[3:06:23] juntzj: honeslty flandre played better in general than i expected
[3:06:25] Kranklis: Hey monte how you doing today
[3:06:25] jerckysminion: we literally had a party at the playboy mansion to celebrate the opening draft of the CGS
[3:06:29] nautcholibre: You would think that pros who play a champion for this long would know I’m gonna die if I don’t keep running why does he turn around what’s his thought process @montecristo
[3:06:41] saberaxe: @IEatLamas He was in EDG
[3:06:42] jerckysminion: and that party cost so much money u don' t even want to know
[3:06:46] Talsifer: Flandre has been fine. His crime is he's not 369
[3:06:48] Amaresu_: i dont tihnk a team with kanavi knight and ruler wants an x factor like theshy tho
[3:06:49] Respect_Dat1: Gayge gayte
[3:06:55] Amaresu_: they just want 369
[3:07:05] lelouch_03: back in 2017 even i was a fan of ur casting i didn't believe the things that you were talking about riot games and you left for blizzard turns out 7 years later what you said about riot is true. they are just as really incompetent as activision blizzard 😅
[3:07:15] Amaresu_: which is also why flandre shouldnt be doing shit like tihs, he doesnt need to pretend he s zeus
[3:07:26] Kranklis: jdg stealin g2 drafts right there
[3:07:29] Wisherex: hwei's portrait colors are so subdued i always think its grayed out from him being dead xD
[3:07:32] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo edg 2021 flandre back lets go
[3:07:33] commando1814: do you think e sports would benefit from selling beer in the stadiums ?
[3:07:35] Shriez: theres Countdown somewhere
[3:07:40] Komarimasita: thers just monte all over my eyes
[3:07:40] saberaxe: @Talsifer His crime is he was a carry player but has been past his prime and on 369 duty since viper was on EDG
[3:07:46] jerckysminion: even peak korean casting monte only had 5 days a week guys !
[3:07:47] IgonnaBe3: damn, the grindset, i wish i had the same motivation for anything i nlife
[3:07:48] rfarleydude97: rfarleydude97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 5 months of service to the Monte! Thought you might like to know that on my first date tonight with this woman that plays/watches League, that she has a 4% increased chance with me (a joke nod to LCS viewership that i explained to her) and she died laughing and mentioned you were a great caster and loves your content always so ty for helping out with my date tonight sir!!
[3:07:49] CrimzsCast: Can we get countdown of Monte cristo back with that banger opener song?
[3:07:52] pandagrog: @Amaresu_ Flandre was legit a lucian one trick lmao
[3:07:54] Fluffieface: Still not enough @MonteCristo
[3:07:57] Kranklis: Kranklis subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:07:57] HeySugar: I'm loving all 6 days, especially now that I don't have to stay up until 4 am for it (OGN)
[3:08:05] Icarus_CS: i dunno i think flandre is getting underrated purely because hes had to replace 369 which is shoes no one can fill. bad series here from him tho for sure
[3:08:09] VanidarD: @commando1814 I think restricting alcohol and gambeling sponsors is one of the stupidest things people can do in esports
[3:08:18] boostmelpay: @MonteCristo was edg flandre 2021 the best top laner in that year??
[3:08:28] Fissiccisst: ...is she here in chat right now?
[3:08:28] commando1814: @vanidard my thoughts as well
[3:08:34] rfarleydude97: ye it was great! def was a fan
[3:08:37] jerckysminion: she might be lurking on youtube
[3:08:43] rfarleydude97: @Fissiccisst currently working on that LOL
[3:08:44] Thaiestro: @heysugar it was hella worth it for me
[3:08:58] rfarleydude97: LMAO
[3:09:00] Amaresu_: that 4% meme ICANT
[3:09:00] rfarleydude97: TRUE
[3:09:08] Kranklis: KEKW
[3:09:12] Lopseypop: 96 + 4 = 100
[3:09:14] rfarleydude97: thats a banger, ty sir
[3:09:14] jerckysminion: LUl
[3:09:17] jerckysminion: LUL*
[3:09:19] Fissiccisst: 4% up but actually 15% down
[3:09:24] pandagrog: maybe you need to call up Baiano and Caedrel
[3:09:29] commando1814: @vanidard drunk Jason kelce but a faker fan would work so well
[3:09:47] jerckysminion: LUL cristoLCS cristoWTF
[3:09:53] jerckysminion: Caralho
[3:09:54] Amaresu_: AINTNOWAY
[3:09:56] nautcholibre: lol!!!
[3:09:58] VanidarD: caedrel wingmanning for u
[3:10:01] rfarleydude97: love you and chat rn, banger atmosphere. thanks guys :D
[3:10:01] VanidarD: I dont know if you want thatr
[3:10:11] Fissiccisst: NO MONTE, you're making it worse!
[3:10:20] Fissiccisst: Brazilian Bump LUL
[3:10:23] jerckysminion: in b4 monte gets twitter threats from mad CBL fans
[3:10:40] AndrasMan01: Get some vampetas in there, brazilians love those
[3:10:45] Kranklis: jdg going with a g2 draft gotta respect that
[3:10:49] commando1814: well educated memes is why we come
[3:10:52] jerckysminion: not vampeta......
[3:10:54] VanidarD: On is so weak this game
[3:11:29] CrimzsCast: Was poppy banned?
[3:11:29] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:11:33] commando1814: is on still a work class adc ?
[3:11:37] VanidarD: why the fuck did vampeta take a nude foto like that btw? I never understood that
[3:11:48] Amaresu_: that combo by knight is just wrong no
[3:11:57] Amaresu_: cant he just ult him from fog and set up everythingelse after?
[3:12:00] Fissiccisst: hoping to catch flandre window shopping LUL
[3:12:03] noiseCorrido: PepeLaugh
[3:12:05] AndrasMan01: Just a power move i guess
[3:12:05] VanidarD: its a brazillian footballer
[3:12:19] VanidarD: to imply that you are gay, brazillians post him naked at ppl on twitter
[3:12:24] Amaresu_: lmfao
[3:12:28] CrimzsCast: Sounds like a vampire goth character
[3:12:29] Talsifer: LUL
[3:12:30] VanidarD: its very stupid
[3:12:39] Talsifer: It's their new 23+1
[3:12:48] Fissiccisst: imagine thinking being gay is a bad thing in 2024
[3:12:48] Amaresu_: ikr xD
[3:12:51] Komarimasita: Komarimasita subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! got em
[3:12:51] jerckysminion: LUL
[3:13:00] VanidarD: mate it makes no fucking sense xdd
[3:13:00] Kranklis: br gutys are wild
[3:13:04] jerckysminion: monte let's all go to brazil n wear the number 24
[3:13:07] Fluffieface: sad that they still care so much about homosexuality.
[3:13:14] lazink: You sure it wasn't an MLB player in the new pants they got?
[3:13:14] commando1814: so dressing up and worshipping Sparta means I'm not gay ?
[3:13:15] Amaresu_: sus
[3:13:21] IEatLamas: We should do that with Monte Kappa
[3:13:30] AdmiralReggie: Gayge
[3:13:34] IEatLamas: Maybe even share pics of ourselves Kappa
[3:13:39] Amaresu_: aight TF has shiv now, lets see the splitpushing
[3:13:40] Slayra: not Gayge at all
[3:13:40] commando1814: @lazink hey now we know why the Dominican players have so many god damn kids
[3:13:44] carcius_: you will never understand
[3:13:44] jerckysminion: what's the counter to that even send naked pictures of us back to them?
[3:13:48] CrimzsCast: New herald suuuucks
[3:13:51] VanidarD: maybe we should do the same with monte's goth pic xdd
[3:13:56] Talsifer: Monte careful now, they might come in and make you wear a 24 jersey
[3:14:08] AndrasMan01: How did they know which picture was the best to post?
[3:14:08] Amaresu_: i gotta say tho. there s such a huge difference between oner rell and literally everyone else on that champ its kinda crazy.
[3:14:09] nautcholibre: maybe it’s like when you walk into the locker room and just drop your towel so everyone has to see your Yordhole
[3:14:20] fatalqwerty: I want a Western Taliyah vs Eastern Taliyah montage
[3:14:29] Kranklis: Monte they may have the image in their folder for years but you see after i post it youre they gay guy
[3:14:44] commando1814: @talsifer that's funny as hell to me as a NASCAR fan cause if you liked Gordon. over Dale you were called gay . Gordon drove the 24
[3:14:44] CrimzsCast: Tf taliyah so hard to get away from
[3:15:08] lelouch_03: i thought ur bluffing about riot being just as worse as blizzard turns out they are actually true we get to see their true colors
[3:15:10] Kranklis: tf seems to be useless late game
[3:15:14] Fissiccisst: Wonder if people would love a "Monte's Coaching Cosplay" Series where Monte basically does a game recap for a team telling them all the crap they did wrong or right
[3:15:27] Fissiccisst: See this shit? STOP IT
[3:15:28] Amaresu_: why is ruler even bot right now
[3:15:40] nautcholibre: What was the best meta and why was it season 3 ?
[3:15:41] Amaresu_: he should be in mid 24/7 from 14 min onwards
[3:15:41] jerckysminion: i mean Vampeta did win the dutch title in 1997 perhaps they like good performing men monte
[3:15:44] commando1814: is this super split TF the best way to play him ?
[3:15:51] Talsifer: @commando1814 lmao why, is he flamboyant or something
[3:15:51] QuackTheDuck: is it just me or is TF so unfairly broken?
[3:15:56] Amaresu_: @QuackTheDuck he is
[3:16:15] Fissiccisst: TF has SO many swords
[3:16:15] MF_DLP: his stats are kinda crazy right now
[3:16:15] Amaresu_: oh wow i m tripping i thought tf was ruler
[3:16:17] Fissiccisst: swords for days
[3:16:21] Amaresu_: i might need sleep ig
[3:16:33] commando1814: @talsifer he was an excellent racer who won a lot early and beat the old guard fan favorite. and his car was called the rainbow warriors

[3:16:36] QuackTheDuck: like him just pressing ult just gives so much info its crazy
[3:17:17] MF_DLP: @QuackTheDuck that used to be the perk of TF though
[3:17:25] hotblew1337: i miss ruler bloodsong lucian LOL
[3:17:35] Talsifer: LUL ok I see why that's the gay car
[3:17:37] MF_DLP: his damage was nice but the ult was really the gimme for picking him in a comp
[3:17:48] commando1814: @talsifer and further the car was red with some rainbow colors Vs the classic Dale all black . it led to some funny shit
[3:17:52] archie7497: @montecristo how you like group mid 5v5 with tf top?
[3:18:23] commando1814: @talsifer right its just adds to the humor of it all
[3:18:29] Amaresu_: how broken is taliyah man
[3:18:35] Amaresu_: why would you ever buff her then buff seraphs twice too
[3:18:49] Fissiccisst: at least they didn't blow anything on Bin, other teams would've wasted a bunch of stuff trying to kill him
[3:19:01] Amaresu_: lvl 13 2 item hwei moment
[3:19:03] commando1814: can you build this ad TF to not be meh in the 30 min 5v5s
[3:19:14] Slayra: hwei classic
[3:19:55] Amaresu_: @commando1814 shiv is a viable build if you re ahead and get it early and start omega pushing sides and taking over the game. if you wanna do good on hit dmg tho you go kraken guinsoos or bork vs tanks and its broken dmg wise.
[3:20:20] QuackTheDuck: even if you get ON as taliyah was that worth?
[3:20:21] CrimzsCast: Blg fighting back alright
[3:20:43] commando1814: @amaresu_ so I read that as scaling dps bastard vs shiv / wave control
[3:20:43] IgonnaBe3: @MonteCristo do you think there should be items like for example sunfire which dont offer anything besides what their base cost and components offer ? Dom was talking about it how such items are counterintuitive
[3:20:45] Amaresu_: they re forced to overgroup tho
[3:21:13] Amaresu_: @commando1814 yeah shiv rfc = push sides and ult for picks, kraken guinsoo bork terminus etc = selfish build for max dmg.
[3:21:18] AndrasMan01: NAram was the best strat all the time, LCS timelords confirmed
[3:22:01] commando1814: @amaresu_ thanks for writing out the styles . I appreciate learning tthe why's especially if they aren't too easy to spot
[3:22:01] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[3:22:29] Amaresu_: i think people are too used to items nowadays being more impactful so old items like sunfire feel outdated
[3:22:42] Amaresu_: but in the older days of league, the vast majority of items were jus stat sticks
[3:22:56] madiiiman: sun fire bad example. I think he means if the only benefit of combining the item is 1 inventory spot instead of 2, it feels bad
[3:23:08] Slayra: Xun CAUGHT
[3:23:23] Fissiccisst: I mean, if anything, the combined item is a compressed version of several items that are only taking up one slot
[3:23:27] Amaresu_: rell got through those traps but nami couldnt? xD
[3:23:27] Fissiccisst: so its still value add
[3:23:53] Amaresu_: @commando1814 np. hope it helped <3
[3:23:58] IgonnaBe3: well so the mathematically optimal way to build is to go bamis into roockerns or bamis into frozen heart instead of completing sunfire because sunfire offers so little on its own compared to bamis + other item, it feels like items such as bamis or the new banshee item are awful to build and counterintuitive
[3:24:12] cannata_: cannata_ converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[3:24:12] captainchunkychris69: got armor  is cheaper and does more dmg
[3:24:31] Amaresu_: i thought this game wouldnt be so close tbh. i guess flandre's ints really derailed JDGs momentum
[3:24:38] Amaresu_: still on soul point at least.
[3:24:42] commando1814: @amaresu_ the I like learning from others with much better eyes than me is a great part of e sports
[3:25:01] Amaresu_: @commando1814 you have a great attitude man SeemsGood
[3:25:39] QuackTheDuck: i think chasing flandre and giving away the objective position is bad
[3:25:43] commando1814: @amaresu_  cheers man !
[3:25:53] Amaresu_: especially cause its soul @QuackTheDuck
[3:26:01] Amaresu_: bad play from blg
[3:26:24] Amaresu_: look at ruler bing chilling perma dashing with no care when they re so split just doing max dmg
[3:26:39] commando1814: do we need to go back to the days of soul being better than Barron ?!
[3:26:47] Amaresu_: perfect fight for him. actually good from flandre and yagao to flank like that even if they die.
[3:26:55] madiiiman: I wud like to see some items in league have no recipe cost, like in dota there are some without recipes. Worst feeling is buying all components and being short of the final item
[3:27:16] Amaresu_: @madiiiman if its more than 2 components especially it feels terrible yeah.
[3:27:16] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:27:36] Amaresu_: @madiiiman and others have like complete meme costs like banshees is 50g to complete FailFish
[3:27:52] commando1814: @amaresu_ I swear all toplaners are guilty of " I'm flanking I'm helping " at least once a game
[3:28:25] QuackTheDuck: ok even with soul I think its still winnable for BLG
[3:28:26] cannata_: Cheer1500 Last Free Nation merch when???
[3:28:38] ace_alchemist: FirstTimeChatter
[3:28:42] Amaresu_: @commando1814 the onus is on the enemy team not you anyway as a flanker, you rarely have perfect vision to know you re for sure unspotted so .. there will be times you will die looking dumb and achieving nothing as a flanker. its just the nature of the beast.
[3:28:43] bbqftw_: cracks me up that "running it down" entered the professsional lexicon
[3:29:02] IgonnaBe3: whats the audience split for last free nation ?
[3:29:07] Amaresu_: @commando1814 if you wanna watch some insane flanks watch t1 this split, zeus in particular but also faker are putting on a clinic in flanking
[3:29:07] archie7497: @montecristo do you think kelsey moser is overrating lec? Like she said g2 plays sidelanes on the new map better than asian teams. (provided I couldn't figure out if she meant all asian teams or just majority)
[3:29:08] Kranklis: What happened with lfn and express vpn I used your code
[3:29:18] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo if you guys make a quality leather jacket with the logo, id buy it
[3:29:33] bunnyorangewander: just distribute it straight to my house, easy
[3:30:03] VanidarD: honestly, Caps is still the best Hwei Ive seen
[3:30:05] Amaresu_: @archie7497 i feel the same as you. who you play against matters too.
[3:30:10] VanidarD: he is legit world class on that champ
[3:30:14] WillaFarris: caps is good at spiltpushing*
[3:30:19] QuackTheDuck: @archie7497 G2 are also not playing against asian teams tho
[3:30:29] AndrasMan01: Why are casters treating BLG like LCK caster were for T1 last year?
[3:30:47] Amaresu_: @AdmiralReggie can you expand on that?
[3:30:51] Kranklis: people give EU shit but g2 could match these teams just give me my copium
[3:31:07] commando1814: @amaresu_ well I could flank like Zeus I'd be pro . I haven't seen anything like his so consist hammer anvil
[3:31:25] Amaresu_: you can flex/cook drafts and have good macro all you want. g2 get hands diffed in every role by at least 5 asian teams.
[3:31:34] beautifulminds: the flash
[3:31:35] AdmiralReggie: @Amaresu_ ?
[3:31:37] zen__cloud: he pressed R and kanavi flashed
[3:31:42] Amaresu_: @commando1814 completely crazy
[3:31:47] Amaresu_: @AdmiralReggie what do you mean by that
[3:31:51] archie7497: @quacktheduck I know. That is why i said she is overrating LEC. Because to say g2 plays sidelanes better than Asian teams assumes other lec teams play sides similarly to asian teams
[3:32:02] Respect_Dat1: i was about to say "oh my god finally a ksante death" and.... of course he lives...
[3:32:06] Amaresu_: @archie7497 spot on
[3:32:10] AdmiralReggie: @Amaresu_ I didnt know I said anything lol
[3:32:19] Amaresu_: wait did i miss tag you?

[3:32:25] AdmiralReggie: I think you did
[3:32:37] Amaresu_: oh yeah i meant to tag @AndrasMan01 mb
[3:32:41] AdmiralReggie: np
[3:32:43] commando1814: @amaresu_ reminds me of Marin's and bengis beefy boys masters
[3:32:54] Amaresu_: holy yagao
[3:32:55] Camer0n000: if udyr is still meta at msi do you think it will be perma ban by the lec teams
[3:32:59] VanidarD: JDG looked so poised to win these last 2 games, I still dont relly know how they lost this series
[3:33:00] Amaresu_: @commando1814 hahahah
[3:33:14] Amaresu_: mages are weak guys
[3:33:20] Amaresu_: we really needed to buff all mage items this patch
[3:33:23] Amaresu_: this is 14.2 btw
[3:33:28] Amaresu_: FailFish
[3:33:38] Kranklis: yagao saved them right there
[3:33:51] commando1814: yago is such a phenomenal mage player
[3:34:06] Amaresu_: taliyah and hwei dmg that fight holy crap
[3:34:20] Amaresu_: and taliyah doesnt even have dcap
[3:34:29] Fissiccisst: @Amaresu_ mage buffs you say? time to break out the artillery mages?
[3:34:49] Amaresu_: @Fissiccisst i mean hwei is busted. caps plays it, faker plays it.. knight plays it
[3:34:55] Amaresu_: taliyah is 100% presence
[3:35:06] henxry934: hello monte
[3:35:08] commando1814: @fissiccisst and whoever uses seraphs and dcap best cannot forget that
[3:35:13] Amaresu_: ^
[3:35:30] Amaresu_: i think you can do that build on syndra too np btw
[3:35:38] Fissiccisst: lol. I'm just always hoping for more champ diversity in all lanes
[3:35:41] Amaresu_: knight who plays a lot of syndra will play her for sure on 14.4
[3:35:45] Fissiccisst: instead of the same tired champs over and over
[3:36:07] Nidsmies: Ksante died!! Woop
[3:36:18] Amaresu_: can just go seraphs zhonyas never die, get dcap + 120 stacks and oneshot even tanks
[3:36:44] Fissiccisst: Gimme some Xerath, gimme some Pantheon, Khazix, Hecarim
[3:36:53] VanidarD: his auto attack has too much range xdd
[3:37:02] Amaresu_: if he died there they for sure chronobreak that if thats the plant bug
[3:37:04] QuackTheDuck: @archie7497 well its just a schrodinger's cat situation where, they neither are better or worst at playing the map against teams they have not played against
[3:37:33] Fissiccisst: what is killing Bin so fast?
[3:37:33] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[3:37:48] Amaresu_: @QuackTheDuck i think the right take to say about it is just.. they re the only western team that could potentially match asian teams  because of that but right now we dont know their power level compared to asian teams.
[3:37:53] VanidarD: how do they not win this game, I still cant believe it
[3:38:01] AdmiralReggie: Clap
[3:38:04] VanidarD: oh no nevermind
[3:38:12] VanidarD: they do, I had things confused
[3:38:13] Kranklis: g
[3:38:15] Kranklis: gg
[3:38:17] Fissiccisst: poor flandre, just bullied all game lol
[3:38:23] Amaresu_: @VanidarD next game tho  Aware
[3:38:38] VanidarD: @Amaresu_ yeah
[3:38:55] QuackTheDuck: putting me on a cliffhanger now I wont know who wins the series
[3:39:04] VanidarD: sad, todays lck games are kinda stinkers
[3:39:04] commando1814: GGs monte
[3:39:12] Fissiccisst: g'night monte
[3:39:18] Rumblextristana: Have a good day Monte
[3:39:22] VanidarD: I guess bro kdf could be a thing, since bro actually won that won last week
[3:39:31] Krethas: Thanks Monte!
