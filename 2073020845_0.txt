[4:56:29] Destroy_RS: cowsep short shows it good that i linked
[4:56:40] Algosith: how could you not have 16 kills at this point when yi is this broken?
[4:56:48] Algosith: this is madness
[4:57:02] Axemply_: Clueless
[4:57:23] beefy713: cowsep have a short about it. but more champs then just yi

[6:01:21] TeaBaggins_5Th: Yeah, that is the goal I think
[6:01:27] caamelll: you do get jinx 2 if you hit twin terror actually..
[6:01:32] shield_donk: do u not listen to the ingame music anymore?
[6:01:42] caamelll: also you can ask for the game to give you twin terror by running a duplicate of a champ
[6:01:49] JohnHambo: I don’t think u can get twin terror 3rd aug
[6:01:54] larouncat: No it's not retro
[6:02:15] caamelll: it is retro i play this game
[6:02:24] caamelll: but you cant hit stage 4 thats true also
[6:02:28] bad_drag: Evenshroud here would be nice
[6:02:33] Kudosa: Lets wait
[6:02:38] JohnHambo: red buff on vex for casts

[6:03:06] caamelll: it was originally not retroactive
[6:03:28] Sparhadrah: 2 claws on Panth
[6:03:32] Kudosa: FeelsOkayMan
[6:05:12] JohnHambo: I’m like 85% sure u can’t get twin terror 3rd augment anyway
[6:05:12] StevenWeener: some of us could be a Lion?
[6:05:13] TeaBaggins_5Th: I feel like you wont get the vi 3 star as the other guy has it already
[6:05:25] kelleghan: when I played double trouble it used to give you a 2 star
[6:05:45] StevenWeener: I'd tell everyone if I was a Lion
[6:05:47] rthk5678: hello
[6:06:10] TeaBaggins_5Th: That is an odd team
[6:06:11] AkromaPunch: roll at 7 for pantheon
[6:06:27] AkromaPunch: still good chance for pantheon but u get thresh as well
[6:06:46] TeaBaggins_5Th: and the 3 costs
[6:07:03] AkromaPunch: yorick for 4 guardians at 8

[6:09:19] AkromaPunch: warmongs is strong in guardian comps
[6:10:43] Kudosa: idk
[6:10:53] JohnHambo: just level
[6:10:53] AkromaPunch: check if the 5 pantheon guy is about to selling it
[6:10:57] TeaBaggins_5Th: I think you kinda have to with this comp though
[6:10:57] JohnHambo: better 3 odds
[6:11:03] AkromaPunch: maybe he s using pantheon as holder
[6:11:08] Kudosa: That sounds like a plan NODDERS
[6:11:14] TeaBaggins_5Th: yeah, that seems like the best strat
[6:12:21] Kudosa: WTf

[6:18:17] TeaBaggins_5Th: extra frontline is better than the ziggs atm I think
[6:18:24] shield_donk: u need 3 chaacters in a line
[6:18:42] JohnHambo: it got changed
[6:18:51] JohnHambo: to actually be useful
[6:18:53] caamelll: you can afford higher cap than pantheon 3
[6:19:01] JohnHambo: sorry I’m talking to the backseat guy
[6:19:04] AkromaPunch: nah u are fine it didnt change
[6:19:34] JohnHambo: it used to be like. u needed 3 in a pack and positioning was awful
[6:19:43] JohnHambo: but it got changed to 3 total in the row
[6:20:25] Kudosa: Madge
[6:20:42] poketltu: thats a classic
[6:20:51] JohnHambo: think he wins the lobby with last stand unless kda guy pops off
[6:21:35] TeaBaggins_5Th: other guy got eliminated
[6:21:40] TeaBaggins_5Th: I think its time to roll
[6:22:12] JohnHambo: your Panth isn’t getting unified now btw
