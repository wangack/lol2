[3:04:52] A_Jhintleman: @VeraciousDuke right but I don't think his Q is an onhit effect
[3:04:52] VeraciousDuke: It's considered a basic attack
[3:05:01] A_Jhintleman: it's just an ability tied to an auto
[3:05:14] A_Jhintleman: I assume attacks that don't crit don't proc it
[3:05:16] Sentety: Should of used akiyama he's also a loan shark

[3:05:40] Mattmattah: those are some solid GLASS

[3:05:44] Mattmattah: made of GLASS
[3:05:48] A_Jhintleman: it can, but the stacks don't crit
[3:05:51] VeraciousDuke: Correct me if I'm wrong here
[3:06:14] VeraciousDuke: What stacks? His passive? Or the item?
[3:06:14] Mattmattah: @VeraciousDuke it can, but the damage from the Q isnt multiplied, only the base auto
[3:06:30] A_Jhintleman: ^
[3:06:57] A_Jhintleman: I assume nasus Q will proc hurricane, but the damage won't scale with his stacks
[3:07:11] A_Jhintleman: unless it's bugged like Illaoi W

[3:09:49] nondescriptguy: and chat
[3:10:08] A_Jhintleman: it applies onhit effects just like always, so something like Yi attacking minions lowers his Q cd by triple the amount
[3:10:35] A_Jhintleman: That being said, the statline is so bad for most melee, so a lot of the funny interactions won't be viab;e
[3:11:12] A_Jhintleman: Did that guy just freaking PULL A GUN?
[3:11:12] Mattmattah: yeazh on hit is plain bad design with the game
[3:11:32] A_Jhintleman: @Mattmattah I mean that's kinda the only purpose of hurricane tho, to have AOE onhits

[3:18:04] A_Jhintleman: yi passive*
[3:18:17] A_Jhintleman: he gets double strike every auto if there are 3 targets
[3:18:29] Mattmattah: might be a good item for your 2nd damage item (jax can only afford 2 damage item)
[3:18:32] A_Jhintleman: trynd also gets triple fury with it
[3:18:40] Mattmattah: Yi will need a passiv rework
[3:18:48] Mattmattah: guinsoo is already completely broken on him
[3:18:49] A_Jhintleman: Honestly yi just needs help
[3:18:54] A_Jhintleman: he feels so bad rn
[3:18:59] Mattmattah: ofc he is

[3:19:09] Mattmattah: champs is balanced around a "rng" stupid mechanics
[3:19:23] Mattmattah: if your phantom hit triggers on your passiv hit, then bonker
[3:19:30] A_Jhintleman: oh lol
[3:19:36] Mattmattah: otherwise, you're useless
[3:19:56] A_Jhintleman: didn't realize that's how it worked
[3:20:00] A_Jhintleman: weird
[3:20:02] Mattmattah: fix this, this will nerf him, sure,, but then we can start making him healthy
[3:20:43] A_Jhintleman: Could be worth it to look into changing his passive to do a double strike after each spell cast instead
[3:21:04] Mattmattah: oh, that's an interesting take
[3:21:10] Mattmattah: but might be too much burst
[3:21:10] A_Jhintleman: so you need to weave your abilities more, and would encourage people to get better at using meditate to auto-reset more
[3:21:15] A_Jhintleman: maybe ye
[3:21:15] paaaanda1: or, hear me out, just delete him from the game
[3:21:18] Mattmattah: maybe with some internal cd
[3:21:34] A_Jhintleman: Honestly YI is the least of my worries
[3:21:41] A_Jhintleman: I just saw the first yi in like 50 games lol
[3:21:52] A_Jhintleman: I'd rather look into TF and Maokai's target CC
[3:21:57] paaaanda1: which is exactly why he can be deleted without repercussions
[3:22:02] A_Jhintleman: there's a reason they're permabanned most games
[3:22:04] Mattmattah: i have 1M4 mastery on jax (jungle), Yi is also the least of my worries ^^
[3:22:05] darkstarr222: @a_jhintleman isn’t that how Lucian and Anshan work?
[3:22:17] A_Jhintleman: Lucian ye, not Akshan
[3:22:27] darkstarr222: Double strike after casting
[3:22:35] A_Jhintleman: I guess it would make him a melee lucian lol
[3:22:40] A_Jhintleman: akshan always gets double strike
[3:22:43] A_Jhintleman: on every attack
[3:22:51] A_Jhintleman: unless he cancels it for the speed boost

[4:57:20] ZeroTheGame: @zmalwo what?
[4:57:31] zmalwo: @ZeroTheGame idk i was asking
[4:57:50] Codicium: @SirhcEz I mean I know I can ride it. I mean the vector that it's aiming at when you're jumping in. It's totally random, despite where you actually aim the arrow
[4:57:52] ZeroTheGame: singSUS
[4:57:59] Fo_Rilla: i was expecting a funny joke now peepoRiot
[4:58:36] ZeroTheGame: @Codicium that hasn't been my experience. It goes where I point
[4:59:19] Codicium: @ZeroTheGame well you've seen it on screen rn twice in a row - he was aiming it towards the tower on prep time, but the moment it starts moving - it's aiming towards like the river
[4:59:24] Fo_Rilla: @Codicium Didnt test it but maybe the initial path of it depends on the champs model look direction when hopping into the herald?
[4:59:35] anjyel: Retreat
[4:59:36] Codicium: @Fo_Rilla o, perhaps
[4:59:41] ZeroTheGame: @Codicium yeah, and that looked weird to me. I have never had that happen
[5:00:01] Codicium: @ZeroTheGame I've seen it happen to more than one streamer, whereas indeed never had it myself
[5:00:25] ZeroTheGame: Ah! maybe something is up. Idk when I'll be able to try it again as a top laner
[5:01:01] saw141: I believe it's determined by how much Rizz you have

[5:01:57] Dboi0422: is samira busted rn, or is this one just fed af?
[5:02:11] Codicium: @ZeroTheGame @Fo_Rilla found this piece on reddit: "So really, the moment you click the herald, whichever direction your mouse is the instant the skillshot arrow thing appears will decide which direction the herald charges. You kinda have to pre-aim the direction."
[5:02:16] saw141: Samira is completely busted.
[5:02:20] ZeroTheGame: @saw141 I'm not even going to pretend to know what that means, lol
[5:02:31] Dboi0422: is it the items?
[5:02:47] Kardain: is that the undying item?

[5:03:12] Kardain: yeah, thanks :)
[5:03:28] Codicium: such a positive item name CarlSmile
[5:03:49] ZeroTheGame: @Codicium Ah! I guess I always pre-aim by default. I think of it like the hex gates, where you have to aim in the direction you want to exit before you actually exit

[5:04:59] Fo_Rilla: @xuanxox91 Thanks for the info catHug
[5:05:00] Codicium: @ZeroTheGame I thought it as well, btu as appears it's that you actually have to be aimed to where you wanna charge BEFORE your champ jump animation starts. Something like that
