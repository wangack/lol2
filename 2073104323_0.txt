[5:44:56] archimedes_9: stunt do you have an email real quick? unrelated Chatting
[5:45:01] Ghostloon: Stunt you're pushing 30 get a grip Kappa
[5:45:03] MajinBuubs: people on the internet are so unhinged
[5:45:07] zionthegod: omg 30? so basically dead
[5:45:20] ThomasTheTwink: @stunt ur an almost 30 year old woman pls pull it together
[5:45:21] unseated9: unsolicited advice is unsolicited advice
[5:45:25] hslxo: KEKW
[5:45:31] GATREUS98: omg yea this got so unhinged fast
[5:45:34] vegandiamond: OMEGALUL
[5:45:34] MajinBuubs: I would be too embarassed to press send on something like that no matter how well intentioned it is CAPYBARA
[5:45:36] archimedes_9: MajinBuubs quason capyL
[5:45:44] MajinBuubs: @archimedes_9 CapyRose
[5:45:48] intervention1st: Who has time for this shit
[5:45:49] archimedes_9: TFT Tuesdays eavWhy
[5:45:50] ThomasTheTwink: @MajinBuubs no fr
[5:45:54] Balldropper: CapyRose
[5:45:58] denunciator: a lot of this is actually advice that's been discussed by successful streamers so idk maybe it was sent anonymously by some high profile streamer that wants them to succeed
[5:46:00] archimedes_9: Chatting don't let the fear win
[5:46:01] denunciator: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[5:46:12] mayosammie: i don't think that's ever been the definition of insanity no matter how many times people say it is
[5:46:24] vegandiamond: the tone is too harsh
[5:46:25] Balldropper: yeah I don't believe he/she meant any harm by sending it
[5:46:28] Ghostloon: he's not wrong but he's just doing the most
[5:46:28] GATREUS98: i can tell this person had a lot of fun writing it so i dont knock him for taking the time.
[5:46:29] Lazynameross: its not unwarranted its just not asked for
[5:46:43] vegandiamond: üå¥
[5:47:00] archimedes_9: not a serial killer, that's such a big compliment eavWoah
[5:47:14] vegandiamond: sorry kyle
[5:47:15] denunciator: hm but the person who wrote it also said the streamer has said certain negative things many times so
[5:47:18] blewbeary: very parasocial
[5:47:20] zzz_iton: we call you  WIll
[5:47:22] Deku_Dreaming: Can I call ya big Will
[5:47:26] zzz_iton: can we play parasocial on stream
[5:47:26] archimedes_9: willy hehe
[5:47:26] denunciator: Will
[5:47:28] unseated9: will i am
[5:47:28] denunciator: hehe
[5:47:29] Jakmo: well, her name is Ohkaty so calling her Katy isn't really weird
[5:47:34] vegandiamond: billiam mhm
[5:47:35] zzz_iton: its life of a streamer ish
[5:47:36] Balldropper: Dearest stunt, would you be in a mood for some Hwei gaming? Sincerely, the dropper of balls
[5:47:37] archimedes_9: quantum gets called nick
[5:47:37] Lazynameross: writer sounds like streamer doesnt understand they possibly need help
[5:47:42] GATREUS98: im going to give the writer the benefit of the doubt, if they wrote that much they probably watch the streamer a lot. so they probably heard her be negative about her own stream enough to prompt him to write all that
[5:47:43] denunciator: accident Plotge
[5:47:44] Deku_Dreaming: @Balldropper I 2nd this
[5:47:47] vegandiamond: thresh
[5:48:13] Balldropper: fair enough <3 took my shot
[5:48:16] bighank29: I think the viewer cares too much and his concern is wasted on the streamer. There are far too many issues with the way women view advice from men especially men they don‚Äôt have intimate relationships with. What woman wants to have a stranger tell her to be accountable for her actions or lack thereof

[5:49:48] vegandiamond: is this giveaway on win or loss
[5:49:48] MajinBuubs: anyone remember when they used a leona lewis song at the end of ff13 and get whiplash

[5:57:16] ThomasTheTwink: 2for1 sounds like a good deal
[5:57:17] Jakmo: sadly you have a Rek'Sai, hopefully they can make it work
[5:58:19] JukeboxHero5: I'm getting to understand that I use ignite way too often on impulse
[5:58:24] Balldropper: stunt we always want help <3
[5:59:02] Balldropper: o boy
[5:59:06] Jakmo: no, because I'm the jungler that doesn't ask my team to help with anything, and they beg ME for help
[5:59:46] archimedes_9: @WholesomeHyena_ pekinCheer
[5:59:46] Jakmo: I think he meant Pyke got it not Jinx
[5:59:53] Lazynameross: wasnt jinx Shruge
[6:00:01] Balldropper: is illaioi mental stabilized now
[6:00:04] JukeboxHero5: @Jakmo While I agree with the sentiment, still, laners have lanes to defend. A specific job. Junglers have much more options so you can expect them to be flexible in their role
[6:01:10] Jakmo: @JukeboxHero5 I am more than happy for any laner to rotate to help, stay in lane, fight their opponent, whatever they want. the complaint side of my comment was getting spam pinged to help by all 3 lanes at once or on the other side of the map
[6:01:35] Balldropper: I just question mark ping my jungle while I am 0-8 garen  support
[6:01:39] Lazynameross: yes
[6:01:50] Jakmo: @Balldropper this sounds about right
[6:01:58] Balldropper: @Jakmo it is too real <3
[6:02:06] Jakmo: yup, absolutely LUL
[6:02:24] Jakmo: my favorite are the "jungle gaps" when the lanes are losing and both jungs are low kp
[6:03:08] Balldropper: I mean to be fair jakmo, if they aren't blaming jungle then they are blaming themselves which most ppl don't prefer to do
[6:03:33] bboopp: dodged those fruits like they were bullets
[6:03:43] Jakmo: yeah, true. I readily say "mb" when I know it's my fault. others don't
[6:03:58] GATREUS98: why they keep giving adcs insane mobility
[6:04:10] Jakmo: Smolder's mobility isn't that insane tbh?
[6:04:18] Lazynameross: its really not lol
[6:04:31] GATREUS98: i dont see cait hopping that wall
[6:04:59] Jakmo: Cait's E has multiple effects attached to it, quicker displacement, and a lower cd though
[6:05:06] Lazynameross: so its the distance>
[6:05:33] Lazynameross: going over a wall isnt new tech
[6:05:36] Deku_Dreaming: Yea I think it's pretty reasonable
[6:05:42] GATREUS98: that wall though is really thick
[6:05:46] GATREUS98: not a lot of champs can do that
[6:05:48] Jakmo: the wall is thick, yes
[6:05:49] Lazynameross: ezreal is old af champ and can go over that
[6:06:13] Jakmo: Ezreal, Tristana, Kayn, Kha'Zix, Shen, there's quite a few
[6:06:33] GATREUS98: in terms of adcs though before zeri only ezreal and tristana could do it
[6:06:34] Jakmo: I'm actually happy about how 'little' mobility a new adc finally has
[6:06:38] Lazynameross: and smolders cant be buffered
[6:06:41] Balldropper: the solari?
[6:06:46] Lazynameross: you can silence him out of the wall even
[6:07:14] Telperion16: stunt how do you pick between Leona Rell Naut in a match, they have basically the same role in a match
[6:07:37] Kaisa_Kardashian: heya :D
[6:07:46] Lazynameross: cinnaBun
[6:07:48] GATREUS98: ok chat be honest is renata a dead champ this season
[6:07:55] voidmoons: no
[6:07:58] Jakmo: in my elo? yes lol
[6:08:01] mellowmellonn: yes

[6:08:51] Jere24cm: same spot stunt
[6:08:51] Jakmo: I never miss it, but it seems most people can't do it
[6:08:53] Jere24cm: the snail
[6:09:12] Jakmo: I've been doing it off feel for years though
[6:09:14] khyger: ok scarra
[6:09:17] razberry10: gotta aim at the smaller rock on the left
[6:09:23] Lazynameross: its like 100 units of grace near a brush or something now
[6:09:34] Deku_Dreaming: You gotta input the konami code before you can place that ward
[6:10:17] denunciator: Active: Jax enters Evasion for 2 seconds: a defensive stance that causes him to dodge all incoming non-turret basic attacks and take 25% reduced damage from all area of effect abilities from champions. Counter Strike can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after the duration.
[6:10:20] Jakmo: I got to play against Jax as Kha, so satisfying that Counter Strike doesn't block Kha Q
[6:10:27] GATREUS98: where did u get that shirt
[6:10:34] Deku_Dreaming: !shirt

[6:11:55] Kaisa_Kardashian: bard mains are the best

[6:12:08] Timeey1337: does anyone else have the bug where you have to click away the report feedback popup like 10x every time you login and start a game?

[6:14:31] Jakmo: @Deku_Dreaming right, I'm asking if the part that bothers you is the "XX wants to fist bump" or the "X Y and Z celebrated" seems like both?
[6:14:36] Telperion16: You need that one Icey mallet I don't remember the name of the item
[6:14:40] denunciator: oh that's the tank azir going around
[6:14:43] Telperion16: It would slow people on hit
[6:14:47] Deku_Dreaming: Ah right, yes I don't like anything relating to that showing up at all
[6:14:51] Jakmo: @Telperion16 Frozen Mallet Aware
[6:14:53] archimedes_9: what's the point of tank azir
[6:14:56] blewbeary: showmaker was building Frozen Heart Azir
[6:15:13] Jakmo: @Deku_Dreaming I've seen multiple people use it to gage the mental of each player
[6:15:24] Telperion16: RIP Frozen Mallet
[6:15:25] Deku_Dreaming: I like the fistbump emote but I don't need a chat message telling me to do it. Just takes up space and can get in the way of seeing other pings that are actually related to the game
[6:15:42] OmegaMonsoon: im pretty sure you can disable the message in settings
[6:15:46] OmegaMonsoon: i could be wrong
[6:15:53] Deku_Dreaming: @OmegaMonsoon I'll take a look at that, thanks!
[6:16:02] Jakmo: @Deku_Dreaming I get that, other chatter said they think it can be disabled. It's nice seeing who joined the fist bump

[6:46:32] everyman322: @teteus_ I'm pretty sure the amount of plastics in our milk is terrible for health too so regardless of the reason, you're probably better off with a paper carton anyway
