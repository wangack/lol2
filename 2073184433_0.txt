[0:54:04] StreamElements: Cowsep moved to Korea in September 2012 originally to become a game developer. He secured a job as a teacher fresh out of university to get his foot on the ground, failed to get any jobs as a game developer, and transitioned into a full time streamer and stayed there because he likes how the cities are set up, and how comfortable and easy it is to live there. Hes been streaming since 2014 full time.
[0:54:05] LULuser: have you won yet
[0:54:23] Kennyl4d: Why don't you move to Switzerland daddy?
[0:54:31] Kennyl4d: I hear it's good for game devs

[0:58:47] AdiosOcelote: Cowsep doesn't really have a main account. He has like at least 5 accounts (probably more) that he plays on almost regularly. He'd need to visit all the accounts to know, and that is too much unnecessary work for something that doesn't even matter obitar_x
[0:58:48] ACR_kakashi: how long does it take to code a 2d game like this ?

[1:09:46] Galkaria: how is that any different than invading L1 and completely removing the enemy jungler from a 35 minute game? you're ruining someone elses game when you compete regardless of the levels of inconvenience
[1:09:57] PixelScientist11: god i miss this game
[1:10:22] TheBambeh: do crit build work?

[1:13:59] cosmoflake: thats how I feel about RTS. when I used to play on the starcraft 2 ladder and kept getting cheesed every game. completely ruined the experience for me
[1:14:05] thebladeofpeace: Are you gonna be building runaans? Or ist it not worth
[1:14:13] superg64: renekton is rough for yi but if they telegraph empowered w too much you can use w damage reduction
[1:14:44] LaatiMafia: I have never been good in RTS games Sadge Turn-based games are more enjoyable for my boomer brain widepeepoHappy
[1:14:51] cosmoflake: yeah, but all you wanted was a standard game. but people figured out that the fastest way to climb the ladder was to cheese every goddamn time
[1:15:10] Galkaria: people calling zerging cheese LUL it's an actual strategy
[1:15:17] LaatiMafia: Scholar's mate in chess Aware
[1:15:30] darivera7alf: which champ u play if they ban Yi?
[1:15:57] Karego: tryharding urf is so sad
[1:16:00] LaatiMafia: @darivera7alf Anivia peepoGiggle
[1:16:09] Driveup: starcraft 2 is the best game i have ever played but it is too demanding and complex. if people are losing to cheese in starcraft they are just bad
[1:16:20] Galkaria: sometimes peoples fun is completely crushing and dominating the enemy team
[1:16:21] stevo90_: people that go ap shiv and rush nexus in urf.....

[1:17:14] LaatiMafia: Why is peepoRiot called RIot when there is also RIOT  RAGEY
[1:17:25] sh1ny3: Haven't been watching you in a while. How Is Yi in Season 14?
[1:17:43] TheBambeh: do crit build work
[1:17:53] excilerv: @sh1ny3 Getting oneshot by any
[1:18:26] sentwin1337: @Cowsep i quit league and its the best decision i've ever made, been playing since 2009. It's stilll amazing nostalgia to watch you play though. :)
[1:18:51] AllAroundTV1: AUTOFILLED LULW
[1:18:53] jaximusfrank: I miss building duskblade and going invis, 3 shot with hail of blades
[1:19:05] PiVoRsc: Did you try runan huricane build yet? Its wild
[1:19:07] LaatiMafia: I quit climbing in League and became a deranker and ARAM enjoyer. Has made the game a lot more enjoyable.
[1:19:27] JuKKi_: @sentwin1337 I did the same with Dota and league ranked - and big mood
[1:19:40] sentwin1337: @JuKKi_ my mental health improved a lot
[1:19:50] JuKKi_: Yeah, i'm alot less angry now LuL
[1:19:55] スカサハ: It's definitely gonna be overrated by those 1 in 10 game moments
[1:19:57] fistofnature: in what games is Guinsus good for yi ?
[1:19:58] sentwin1337: @Cowsep swapped to helldivers 2, and it's an amazing game, fun, no stress
[1:20:00] PiVoRsc: But runan huricane makes yi q almost cdless and perma double strike
[1:20:02] Driveup: lots of people play TFT and ARAM only and no soloqueue. i only have fun when i duo in league
[1:20:07] jaximusfrank: Just play drunk and it’s fun
[1:20:25] solzi11: I've been playing league since 2012 and I never did ranked. My "goal" is to tilt people into cursing and then getting them banned :D
[1:20:25] LaatiMafia: Sej is immune to slows once in a while YEP
[1:20:26] ACR_kakashi: she got phase rush o nsejuani
[1:20:31] JuKKi_: @sentwin1337 Same, alot less constant annoyed. And i played mobas since like 2006 LuL
[1:20:41] RickLUL: Rust
[1:20:42] ACR_kakashi: Tetris
[1:20:47] n00bl0rd1337: raid shadow legends

[1:20:54] spinster444: osrs not even close
[1:20:57] LaatiMafia: Penis and puzzles BatChest
[1:21:01] giwrgoslzr: rust is full of dopamine
[1:21:05] Galkaria: Horizon Forbidden West when it comes out in April, then Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth out in May
[1:21:09] スカサハ: Love me some good old roguelike
[1:21:12] jaximusfrank: Been having fun with WoW
[1:21:20] ACR_kakashi: that jinx ezreal ults
[1:21:47] 01youssef: sundered sky good on yi?
[1:21:58] excilerv: @01youssef No
[1:22:02] スカサハ: Roguelike is the peak of replayability tho
[1:22:02] sentwin1337: @Cowsep Lol has become insanely frustarting due to not having power over your games, you rely on your teamates too much after a certain elo (been playing in masters on EUW). Lol felt like i'm in a psych ward, forcing me to handle other ppls mental health. 1 guy going apesh is enough to lose the game.
[1:22:05] sh1ny3: I started watching you when you were still teaching. You inspired me to learn Korean. Now I'm living in Seoul for over 5 years and studying to become a chef at a uni ^^
[1:22:12] 01youssef: @excilerv why
[1:22:13] spiderlauncher: meanwhile in league one game feels like a day sometimes
[1:22:13] LaatiMafia: Runescape replayability: Click a thing and wait. Click a thing and wait. Click a thing and wait Aware
[1:22:48] スカサハ: just wait until rust gets that 4k texture pack
[1:22:58] spinster444: @LaatiMafia yeah it's sick
[1:23:14] sentwin1337: @Cowsep did you know you can'T target fiora with Q under her parry?
[1:23:27] JuKKi_: @sentwin1337 And then the ppl just actively refuse to try becuase they're upset - just drives me up the wall LuL You can be upset and still play the game
[1:24:14] スカサハ: Another argument for roguelike you've been playing magicraft in between queue a ton and you gotta admit it you can replay it for months and it won't get old
[1:24:21] excilerv: @01youssef You don't get any value swaping onhit items with it, It is just for someone like Xin, Renekton, Riven or any other bruiser
[1:24:26] nyxos101: Seems like a lot of competitive game these days are team based though
[1:24:54] MellonFarm: MellonFarm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:25:06] LaatiMafia: @Cowsep Even when playing ARAMs and deranking, you still have a goal. Winning just isn't always it KEKW
[1:26:02] sentwin1337: @JuKKi_ Y, the main issue is that there are people playing this game that want to be the main character, they wanna be 5/0 by 10th min. Main character Syndrome. Being the jungler is even worse, cuz you have to handle 4 ppls mental health at the same time, and you are forced to do sh you don't want to, but u have to otherwise they go apesh and troll.
[1:26:12] gloryhoy: nice
[1:26:15] sh1ny3: @cowsep just wanted to tell you you were a big inspiration. Learned about Korea through you now I've been studying and living here for 5 years.
[1:26:21] muffinlover3: I get banned for 24hours then after its over I still have a 15 min lower que priority so league kinda makes it hard for me to play league
[1:27:07] JuKKi_: @sentwin1337 Yeah, and then if they don't get a good start they just want to give up and start ff spamming. I can understand voting FF and it it doesn't pass just play but ppl actively refuse to. I play support and i imagine it's close to annoyance of jg NotLikeThis
[1:27:12] AdiosOcelote: !fishing

[5:21:10] BigBootyLover3: i don't think you are explaining the puzzle properly
[5:21:10] と恋に落ちる: wow your entire team is coming to help
[5:21:27] BigBootyLover3: i think there are some missing steps so it's giving you the wrong answer, but that's just my guess
[5:21:45] Gphantom99: hey cow, is Hades a game worth playing?
[5:22:04] JuKKi_: Hades is great tbh
[5:22:06] shadow7master: i think ur input to chatgpt was wrong u said 8 while there is 9
[5:22:13] CantyBloke: you still have to finish up i wanna be the boshy :)
[5:22:19] mr_mufasa_: you have the single one lit up in the correct spot. just hit the corners now and it’s good!
[5:22:19] N3rdRag3_: i played yi mid last night and killed it
[5:22:20] LaatiMafia: @Gphantom99 I have played through it with most of the weapons and with all of the Pacts. It is definitely a solid game, although a bit hard at the start.

[8:10:26] funkyweb: as doctor .. let me tell you : theres a bug living in ur nose named Staphylococcus Aureus which causes alot of diseases while it reaches the blood .. however while you eating it makes u stronger against it
