[3:13:30] Ice_Cloud: @SolasR6 Chatting If you’re replacing a toilet, you’ll first need to remove the old toilet. Here’s an overview on how to remove an existing toilet for replacement:       Turn off the water at the shut-off valve located either on the wall or floor near the toilet.     Flush the toilet to drain all the water from the tank and toilet bowl. Use a plunger to force any remaining water down the drain line. While wearing rubber gloves, remove any remaining water from the tank with a sponge and a bucket.

[4:41:41] Pathyul: If you’re replacing a toilet, you’ll first need to remove the old toilet. Here’s an overview on how to remove an existing toilet for replacement: Turn off the water at the shut-off valve located either on the wall or floor near the toilet. Flush the toilet to drain all the water from the tank and toilet bowl. Use a plunger to force any remaining water down the drain line. While wearing rubber gloves, remove any remaining water from the tank with a sponge and a bucket.
