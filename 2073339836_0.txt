[1:59:39] trashpanda_oz: wait i just realized I missed the zyra jungle game
[1:59:44] eliotxshadowfrost21: dudes lost literally every game on gragas ooof
[2:00:16] shadow7master: the ryze is playing for 11 years xdd
[2:01:15] Jakmo: It was his teams for sure COPIUM

[2:04:53] Iamaf33d3r: you should go through the list again after you finish it
[2:05:25] eliotxshadowfrost21: bruh, im literally in calculus 2 right now which is arguably the hardest math class in engineering school and I even struggle with basic math these days
[2:05:39] rdwatts54: How’s Wukong after the buffs?
[2:05:48] SilexFPS: 15 min queue incoming KEKW
[2:05:48] Jakmo: @eliotxshadowfrost21 I remember that LUL, yup and good luck
[2:06:32] Iamaf33d3r: @eliotxshadowfrost21 i found calc 3 harder

[2:08:45] shadow7master: ohh lord hecarim Aware
[2:08:50] eliotxshadowfrost21: ya
[2:08:59] lewhitehd69: xayah would have won draft just saying
[2:09:33] eliotxshadowfrost21: @shadow7master i feel like this is gonna be a goofy ass game. anytime santorin gets movement champs i feel like he gets loopy
[2:09:39] Iamaf33d3r: @eliotxshadowfrost21 but GL in engineering school
[2:09:42] Iamaf33d3r: <3
[2:09:50] Sejstargazin: my goattttttt
[2:09:52] Sejstargazin: santorinnnnnnn

[2:10:56] navcite: no
[2:10:59] lewhitehd69: Shruge
[2:10:59] Sejstargazin: I've been playing lots of first strike gragas lately it doesn't feel too strong but it's fun
[2:11:10] Iamaf33d3r: Pay attention because Calc 2 feeds into DIF EQ which is in like EVERY engineering course after
[2:11:29] kongrazzca: hI
[2:12:18] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Iamaf33d3r yeah, my cal 2 teacher also teaches DE and shes constantly mentioning we are going over the same stuff she is in that class right now lol
[2:12:36] navcite: think they even build SS on hec now but dik for sure
[2:12:40] Iamaf33d3r: What engineer are you going to be?
[2:12:44] navcite: idk*
[2:13:08] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Iamaf33d3r the part kicking my ass right now is digital logic. idk why that shit isnt clicking for me and im probably gonna be having to retake it in the fall...
[2:13:24] Jakmo: sKayleing
[2:13:52] Iamaf33d3r: You must be electrical @eliotxshadowfrost21

[2:14:33] lewhitehd69: @eliotxshadowfrost21 digital logic kicked my ass first time too KEKW
[2:14:46] Iamaf33d3r: I mean isn't it just 0's and 1's
[2:14:53] Iamaf33d3r: xDD
[2:15:16] eliotxshadowfrost21: @lewhitehd69 i was good on conversions with binary decimal and hex, its when you get into the damn gates and mapping that has me all fucked up
[2:15:32] Baklawaz: hecarimgodx EZ
[2:15:36] Iamaf33d3r: Think of it as water flow no?
[2:15:50] lewhitehd69: dantes out dated EZ santorin activated EZ
[2:16:21] lewhitehd69: @eliotxshadowfrost21 yh same, i scored 1 point on the exam KEKW
[2:16:24] Iamaf33d3r: IDK somehow someone explained to me signaling with water and it made sense
[2:16:44] TimeWizardLuL: sundered good on hec?
[2:17:03] Iamaf33d3r: I only ever use it to select Remote IO and Safety Circuits for my job
[2:17:33] eliotxshadowfrost21: @lewhitehd69 and my class is graded on 6 10 point quizzes a 25 point midterm and a 25 point final. I did 9 on quiz 1, 5.5 quiz 2 and 6.5 quiz 3 and have a 66% in the class. like welp guess ill fail lol
[2:17:49] rvend: wait does that mean u guys study logisim?
[2:17:50] rvend: lmao
[2:18:36] Iamaf33d3r: Prolly some "learn the basics before you learn something useful" teaching strategy @rvend
[2:18:44] blahhhhhhhghg: Haaaaaa
[2:19:08] Iamaf33d3r: Engineers have hijacked @Santorin chat
[2:19:19] rvend: @Iamaf33d3r do you learn logisim tough?
[2:19:23] lewhitehd69: @eliotxshadowfrost21 yh its always later Okayge
[2:19:40] Iamaf33d3r: I did not I was mechanical/Chemical engineering @rvend
[2:19:50] Iamaf33d3r: My brother is a computer programmer
[2:19:56] rvend: i see
[2:20:35] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Iamaf33d3r chemical engineering oof, thats some rough stuff but i hear they make a lot of money
[2:20:46] rvend: thats my goat
[2:21:18] Tristiiano: @santorin I have won 20 out of my last 23 solo que games now just two wins from plat! now your time for win streak too
[2:21:32] Iamaf33d3r: @eliotxshadowfrost21 I do well enough, kind of 3 years behind from working on PhD
[2:22:06] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Tristiiano you shoulda played the lottery instead bro you hit the jackpot on league matchmaking lol
[2:22:17] TorqueBandit: how tf did kayle die
[2:22:20] TorqueBandit: it was over
[2:24:26] shadow7master: why ez and shaco holding hands and leaving bot
[2:24:35] Tristiiano: @eliotxshadowfrost21 facts ahahah
[2:25:26] Tristiiano: I need to hop on Santorins account and give him my luck too
[2:25:29] blahhhhhhhghg: Give me the jews
[2:25:56] Tristiiano: are you going shaojin eclipse black cleaver?
[2:26:57] Jakmo: had a Shaco supp today and he topped the charts, I believe it
[2:28:30] Jakmo: Season 4 Aware
[2:28:31] blahhhhhhhghg: I went 17-3 as Senna support yesterday lol
[2:29:26] Tristiiano: atleast jungle is strong role
[2:29:46] blahhhhhhhghg: Why would you play anything besides support? You don't have to CS, if your ADC sucks you can just leave lane. You can just tax laner xp whole game and be fine
[2:29:57] Tristiiano: I think poppy go so hard this game
[2:31:34] DeathWaffle: This is looking like Iron/sliver lol
[2:32:20] trashpanda_oz: it's so much easier to win in gm+ it's crazy lol
[2:32:51] trashpanda_oz: wait that darius looked like a riot account
[2:33:00] Tristiiano: shaco brain built diff
[2:33:04] DeathWaffle: Idk how people main just one champ, I would get bored lol
[2:33:20] rvend: @DeathWaffle sometimes its the best way to climb bro
[2:33:22] Tristiiano: @deathwaffle true that I usually play around 50/60
[2:33:47] trashpanda_oz: brooo i literally dropped from chall cuz i was getting master players perma :(
[2:34:09] DeathWaffle: @rvend I guess I dont care about climbing to much but just getting better in general
[2:34:22] Tristiiano: @santorin would you have gone black cleaver after eclipse?
[2:34:44] koushik_10: bro i lost 2 games today hard winning jgl i cant play man bcz my bot never come for drakes i cant
[2:34:49] koushik_10: like how do i play
[2:34:54] shadow7master: sej
[2:35:00] Tristiiano: thanks 🤘
[2:35:12] koushik_10: bot rather gets plate then come for drake
[2:35:26] Tristiiano: @koushik_10 that’s when I say F off then and go mid top never look at a dragon again or I coin flip a smite battle 💀
[2:35:51] Ancarage: yea all of 3 those champions
[2:35:53] Tristiiano: @santorin hmm abusing Diana buffs for elo?
[2:35:59] Ancarage: looks like a pain to QER into
[2:36:00] koushik_10: @Tristiiano bro we had gold lead but lost elder smite fight and lost the game with 6k gold lead
[2:36:01] Ancarage: PepeLaugh
[2:36:03] koushik_10: i want to cry now
[2:36:15] Ancarage: all of those*
[2:36:26] shadow7master: u hv yone 200years champ surely a win
[2:36:26] koushik_10: bcz my bot lane is duo i think they run it down just before elder spawns
[2:36:35] koushik_10: i am actually crying
[2:36:54] Tristiiano: @koushik_10 man that’s tilting. I did that to someone a month ago 😂 we won because I put smite elder they were so far ahead like in you  were
[2:37:21] koushik_10: bro na this has to be a joke man
[2:37:39] koushik_10: like why dont u come drake when u have lead in lane and take the free win
[2:37:47] koushik_10: i dont understand bot laners mid
[2:37:49] koushik_10: mind
[2:38:28] Jakmo: @koushik_10 it's easy. Plate gives the adc gold and drake does not. there ya go
[2:38:50] rexxarhero4: did i miss the heca game?
[2:38:50] Tristiiano: @santorin Diana getting her E recast time to 0.25 instead of 0.6 or whatever it is. 14.5 tho my bad
[2:38:56] rexxarhero4: or not there yet
[2:39:00] Jakmo: @Santorin I got trapped in there today and it had me outside camp patience
[2:39:23] Jakmo: @rexxarhero4 you did miss it, but you don't want to see it
[2:39:25] Tristiiano: @koushik_10 yeah no one listens in the game bro. even simple ward pings they complete zombie mode
[2:39:25] koushik_10: @Jakmo ya bro just like that we gave soul bcz my bot lane never comes to drake first before there support to place vision
[2:39:37] rexxarhero4: @Jakmo fair
[2:39:44] Jakmo: oh I know, I'm a jungle main. but that's the mindset
[2:40:05] Tristiiano: you guys just need win streak like me
[2:40:28] koushik_10: @Tristiiano bro its been 2 weeks since i had a win streak
[2:40:32] Tristiiano: ahahah
[2:40:36] koushik_10: i am hard stuck in diamond
[2:40:37] Tristiiano: doomed account go next
[2:40:41] koushik_10: cant even get to masters
[2:40:51] Tristiiano: atleast you diamond tho I’m just a gold nooby
[2:41:25] koushik_10: bro there is no difference in diamonf and gold to be frank by bot lane that game played like bronze
[2:41:27] Tristiiano: but I’m sure that makes you more annoyed since it’s expected that they should come help @koushik_10
[2:41:57] Tristiiano: elite 500 Vladimir is so insane
[2:42:17] koushik_10: sry @Santorin we are just letting out in ur chat
[2:42:21] Tristiiano: the guy gets kills pre 6 and Idek I do not replicate that’s certain
[2:43:03] Tristiiano: do you guys think arcanist shaco or wild card shaco is better skin
[2:43:42] lewhitehd69: @Tristiiano AD = wild card, AP = arcanist
[2:43:59] Tristiiano: that’s the most troll thing you could write
[2:44:05] Tristiiano: I don’t want to buy both 💀
[2:44:05] asmooth11: That match up only gets worse for trist lol
[2:44:27] Jakmo: just don't buy them. get them free from chests
[2:44:52] Tristiiano: @jakmo eh just like $5 nothing crazy
[2:45:04] Tristiiano: I got the prestige shaco but I can’t stand the purple LOL
[2:45:13] lewhitehd69: AlienDance
[2:45:31] Jakmo: yeah I'm just teasing. I'm ashamed of how much I've spent on cosmetics but haven't spent anything in years
[2:45:53] Tristiiano: the skins are really goated in this game for sure
[2:46:10] Tristiiano: I am really picky with graphics of games I play. league I really like graphic wise
[2:47:04] DeathWaffle: Vald is such a stupid champ
[2:47:10] lewhitehd69: im the vlad GIGACHAD
[2:47:24] Jakmo: Vlad's the Heimogoatin
[2:47:53] Tristiiano: any high elovlad players here I have question
[2:48:49] TorqueBandit: @Tristiiano yeah im silver 4 whats up
[2:48:57] Tristiiano: santorinSad
[2:48:58] Ancarage: diana used to be able to EQ at that tiny pixel
[2:49:23] Ancarage: from the back of the pit, i wonder if that ever got changed
[2:49:24] SilverSurferIsRadd: how does diana feel this patch?
[2:49:42] shadow7master: old diana was great
[2:49:52] Jakmo: @Tristiiano what's the question, high likelihood some lurker has the answer
[2:50:35] TorqueBandit: pinging your item
[2:50:46] TorqueBandit: possibly complimenting damage?
[2:50:49] Tristiiano: sup thinks you should have rushed tank item
[2:51:15] Jakmo: he's 100 KP and 100 Kills, needs tank item first, NODDERS
[2:51:32] Ancarage: well the ping is only visible during the short time after a take down, surely she is saying what a great job killing their top laner with nashor tooth Kappa
[2:51:36] Tristiiano: like the Diana from last season going that tank variant
[2:52:40] shadow7master: my eyes
[2:52:46] Tristiiano: these have to be bought accounts surely
[2:52:54] Tristiiano: or they hate you
[2:52:56] Tristiiano: either rone
[2:53:15] Zeiik101: I didn't know there was a shortcut for which channel you ping in lol (party/team)
[2:53:23] henriksson__: i swear, people in this game are more stupid every season
[2:53:41] Tristiiano: @henriksson__ pls don’t talk about me like that
[2:54:13] Jakmo: I don't think they're more stupid, I think it's that people care less to actually research values, interactions, and details of the game
[2:54:22] Jakmo: ego gets replaced for knowledge
[2:55:12] MythologyPlays: opinions on rell jungle rn?
[2:55:46] Tristiiano: the yone ults super debatable
[2:55:52] SilverSurferIsRadd: Rev Theory on the playlist???? Holy throwback
[2:56:09] MythologyPlays: blue mountain state lol
[2:56:13] shadow7master: yeah the yone still didnt hit a single ult
[2:56:22] kindreducation: do u remember this match up xd
[2:56:28] kindreducation: i played diana againts your gragas lol
[2:56:29] iYogert: Santorin in NA or EU?
[2:56:38] Zeiik101: Zeiik101 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:56:43] kindreducation: its eu
[2:56:47] shadow7master: @iYogert euw
[2:57:16] JoieRide: not dead Pog
[2:57:40] Tristiiano: nice one
[2:57:53] Ancarage: what is this illegal chain of events
[2:57:54] Ancarage: OMEGALUL
[2:57:57] JoieRide: ez sneak POGGERS
[2:58:04] bouldermaster: bouldermaster subscribed with Prime. 
[2:58:17] TorqueBandit: dare i say... winnable
[2:58:30] Tristiiano: heist master new account name?
[2:58:44] Tristiiano: heistorin?
[2:58:54] SilverSurferIsRadd: it changed from last season, no?
[2:58:55] TorqueBandit: bankrobbertorin
[2:59:11] Jakmo: the old Trinity Force payment scheme
[2:59:35] TorqueBandit: ITS HAPPENING
[2:59:40] shadow7master: Pog
[3:00:10] apes_kingdom: zhonyas and banshee being defensive items and having a rod feels weird af
[3:00:15] TorqueBandit: oh em gee, from like 3 13 to 9 13
[3:00:19] Tristiiano: vlad done f all for 10mins now
[3:00:41] TorqueBandit: and thats how the cookie crumbles
[3:01:17] Jakmo: when they decided on a build path, but needed to keep it cheap smh
[3:01:38] Ancarage: they probably thing large rod is better as a components for banshee, since you almost never get banshee early
[3:02:04] Jakmo: it makes it feel better for sure but it really should be a blasting wand
[3:02:05] Ancarage: and large rod is better as a component taking up an item slot compare to the 850 wand
[3:02:10] TorqueBandit: poggers engage/disengage
[3:02:14] rvend: my goat
[3:02:17] TorqueBandit: engage/disengage/engage master heister
[3:02:18] M4R05: TSM TSM TSM
[3:02:18] Tristiiano: HE IS CLEAN WITH IT
[3:02:24] shadow7master: diana is back bby
[3:02:26] Tristiiano: I JUST BECAME A DIANA MAIN
[3:02:39] Jakmo: the defensive component is really weak for AP so they probably wanted to add some to the path somewhere
[3:02:55] Ancarage: idk banshee is just a weird niche item
[3:02:58] Rhaegar_UGKz: actual 1v9
[3:03:05] TorqueBandit: did tsm wonnered?
[3:03:57] Jakmo: that Jinx W was perfect
