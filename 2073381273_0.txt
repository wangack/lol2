[0:34:51] mistermurr: Shorts can be useful for stream highlights, don't you think?
[0:34:56] theenation97: I think no matter what you do, as long you’re happy and satisfied that’s all that matters imo
[0:34:58] MagikMike: <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:34:58] fakercallsmedaddy: maybe i like yt videos so much because i got to know you on there, first time i saw you was with SivHD on yt , great times
[0:35:13] JenEsus: I have come to the conclusion that people give up because they're not good enough at a video game to fight through the consequences of their own mistakes.
[0:35:26] catastrofia: IDK how I found you, i just did!
[0:35:37] imperialninja: thats also how i found kaypea :) lol
[0:35:51] Darkcyter: @shan_192 kaypHello

[0:36:57] Teekwan: Riot James is the prime suspect for any minor inconvenience
[0:37:01] fakercallsmedaddy: yt wants to control everything, meanwhile they are focusing on shorts so much, and tbh its addicing to eatch shorts
[0:37:02] amethyst_art22: call me biased but you're my only female League streamer that i consistently watched and followed over the years. other streamers just didn't click with me.
[0:37:04] shanadrin: shes doing too well, making too much money! sabotage her! Kappa

[0:40:01] Teekwan: @KayPea Larian Studios said that the thing that will bring you the most success, amongst other things is building a supportive community, and i think most people tend to forget to connect with their audience, so i'm glad you're focused on that kaypFlower
[0:40:10] tacobean1: It's because you take pride in your content and you didn't want to become a content machine and just pump out content that you aren't proud of and happy with

[1:11:27] jimbob_ywert: HELLOOO :D
[1:11:36] ObsceneSanity: @KayPea has lucas talked about how his matchmaking feels just way out of balance too? high elo games do not look high elo
[1:11:40] guiltyprawn: Nerdge wrong ad
[1:11:43] guiltyprawn: !sub
[1:11:43] Nightbot: fun tip, the church of KayPea cleanses your screen of all ads, sub for more church benefits such as shenanigans and tomfoolery
[1:11:45] catastrofia: cuz he's blu duh
[1:11:51] guiltyprawn: Right ad
[1:12:03] goblingrl666: trundle sounds fun
[1:12:09] brodyy186: Do you notice a diff in the region? When it comes to like player base
[1:12:21] Hymuno: its so people will complain about hurricane instead of mmr/matchmaking/everything else
[1:12:28] mistermurr: If it were a fresh account wouldn't it start at like silver or something like that?
[1:12:42] Zohrooo: @Hymuno watch me complain about both o7
[1:12:44] andygoestohell: Not the church kaypea 😂
[1:12:53] mjuz1k: The wors part about hurricane melee is that their passives procs with it
[1:13:30] ObsceneSanity: @mjuz1k not that panth needs it, but i tested it in pbe and i get empowered abilities every other aa now lol
[1:13:35] Teekwan: Have y'all seen the rito's fighting game teaser?
[1:13:48] RushXtanker: i've been lucky this season
[1:13:50] Teekwan: With the name i can't even spell
[1:14:10] AnwarJamel: but everyone plays with the same rules, dont you think ?
[1:14:22] CynicalScrub: they were supposed to do a full MMR reset this season and just abandoned it :(
[1:14:23] Nick_x_R: I was playing on the begining of the season and I have 30% winratio because of matchmaking.. so i stopped.. doesn't feel like league anymore
[1:14:24] kalls2k: Game's getting worse to balance as new seasons barge in
[1:14:40] Hymuno: with the layoffs there is only 174 combined years of dev exp so its all falling apart mayahiSadge
[1:14:43] mistermurr: 100%
[1:15:01] Teekwan: @KayPea they have Ahri in there, and the animation is very smooth at least in teaser
[1:15:07] Teekwan: She looks so badass
[1:15:12] itsAddie34: i just don't bother with ranked cuz MMR is trash and people are so mean
[1:15:30] NitricAcidvsMetal: the layoffs are almost exlusively on the LoR team, so that's not an excuse
[1:15:52] Hybearnova: i think thats how they're trying to combat smurfs and boosters
[1:16:15] Ultranage: Hi you. Are you having a great sunday?
[1:16:21] ObsceneSanity: @itsAddie34 i wish it was isolated to ranked but norms have been awful experiences too
[1:16:27] Zohrooo: but they deny it T_T
[1:16:46] itsAddie34: @ObsceneSanity oh 1000%. it's not a fun time at all most the time but if you play with the right person it's not horrible
[1:16:48] catastrofia: Greg Street broke this game
[1:17:03] MissMeerkat: kaypHello kaypFlower
[1:17:19] Hybearnova: honestly when i want to have fun i just play aram
[1:17:20] ObsceneSanity: you cant say you're not setting up loser q while simultaneously saying they keep players at 50%
[1:17:47] PainOfDemise: Well, Esports really isn't making any money.
[1:17:49] Nick_x_R: Exactly what you're saying.. it's annoying and plus when you get low WR because of the matchmaking not only it frustrates you as a player but even team mates when they see it immediately tilt and are toxic towards you ...
[1:18:26] ObsceneSanity: this is gunna be toxic but i dont think a 2v2 fighting game was the right team to keep.
[1:18:44] mistermurr: It's like the teacher who says at the beginning of the course "you all have a A+, it's on you to keep it" LUL
[1:18:49] Lunaremis: Aloh
[1:19:04] Nick_x_R: <3
[1:19:07] Teekwan: I legit watched the vod from two days ago with the same rant. This is a thing, yes? Us spiraling into insanity, trying to prove that the losers queue is a thing... xD

[1:20:51] CutyAhriana: Hi, sorry, I don't really speak, I'm very shy and my English is really not very good, I often use a translator. I made bronze 4 after 420 + game in iron, I won more often in duo with high level people than average, more often with gold rank, and when I q alone I often found myself against silver or bronze but I am already winning against people full emeraude it wasn't great for me I won just right but not because of me.

[2:01:00] rara398: aram

[2:01:35] mistermurr: Just wanted to let you know, your top and jg are autofilled

[2:03:33] ObsceneSanity: They're surprisingly not a duo
[2:03:40] mistermurr: Malz is duo with smolder apparently
[2:04:06] ObsceneSanity: malz and smolder the duo
[2:04:09] bratz_xoxo: janna should be rotating everywhere by now
[2:04:12] dasol6: do you like first strike on hwei?
[2:04:32] Niomah: ARRRGH. I just played an ARAM. I was Syndra. I had over 600 AP. Rank 3 ult. Max balls on the field. I couldn't even scratch a Xin Zhao with NO MR ITEMS.
[2:04:36] TomNova: is it just the curse of playing a new champ ? theyre like oh nuuu, we gotta ruin their game
[2:04:41] TomNova: well new ish
[2:04:43] Hymuno: at least the basement is only £3.99. Floors pretty cold though. Although I did get an extra serving of gruel today.
[2:05:19] kreumbly: hes timing his ganks with your E cd it looks like so you cant fear him out of stun animation
[2:05:24] mistermurr: That fear was so well timed haha
[2:05:25] Sir_Fish_Bucket: Did you cancel his ult with your E? nice
[2:05:52] Casyo99: maybe stream snipers
[2:05:56] bratz_xoxo: my girl is pulling an isolde
[2:06:04] Fremdo: you’re so much better than me I would have said obsessed in all chat
[2:06:04] ObsceneSanity: I get why viego doesnt go top bc darius smacks him but what the fuck..
[2:06:15] mrry2k: i see a lot of ppl ive played with before in ur games and it gets me thinking does emerald rly have that few players or something
[2:06:17] uksCRASH: All save ults for Kaypea guys kaypAyyy
[2:06:23] kreumbly: you got that Teemo level global taunt going
[2:06:23] Jazzoholic: hwei is so much fun tho
[2:06:30] Darkcyter: @Niomah @Sir_Fish_Bucket @kreumbly @mrry2k kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:06:35] kaithegemini: Hwei is so fun
[2:06:35] andygoestohell: Tbh I love when I'm playing something simple like Lux and try to kill Hwei while he has to type a whole essay of abilities
[2:06:37] Niomah: Hey @Darkcyter
[2:06:39] malllymore: @mrry2k dead game
[2:06:45] Stigurstarym: btw happy "womans day"
[2:06:50] Jazzoholic: maybe malignance is actually decent on him
[2:06:51] Stigurstarym: it's at least womans day in Iceland
[2:07:08] mrry2k: @Darkcyter hello !!
[2:07:09] georgo__: you underutilize your w
[2:07:14] Niomah: Hwei was fun the one time I played him, after about half an ARAM when I figured everything out
[2:07:19] georgo__: ww and wq is so useful
[2:07:39] georgo__: and ew is pretty good for zoning
[2:07:42] Jazzoholic: @Stigurstarym cool! do you also celebrate international women's day?
[2:08:02] bratz_xoxo: janna and darius not leaving their lane is amusing
[2:08:09] Stigurstarym: isn't today international womens day? :O
[2:08:21] Jazzoholic: @Stigurstarym no it's march 8 ^^
[2:08:32] drtesseract22: then your team forgets that you had 3 mid half the game and flames
[2:08:37] Stigurstarym: oh, well it's womans day today in Iceland :D
[2:08:45] TomNova: i feel that
[2:08:57] Saffy1: i dont understand what this season is, but it absolutely sucks.
[2:09:19] Saffy1: i have also not had any luck with league at all
[2:09:19] Jazzoholic: @Saffy1 +1
[2:09:28] TepenTamot: WE should always be used for damage amp, bcs hwei's dmg is too strong with WE
[2:09:41] notclarkyyy: remember league of tanks?
[2:09:43] aside_sue: OMG HI Kels! Thats a strange looking lux!
[2:09:58] xPreparedx: What is the basis for saying this season is so bad? I guess I am just not understanding the factors driving that statement?
[2:10:07] Casyo99: what does it take to make the game great again? please... The game is so bad nowadays
[2:10:37] Nick_x_R: What is going on in that game hahaha
[2:10:55] mistermurr: I was so hopeful that mmr would be better with the changes they were talking about but its seems like it's not u.u
[2:11:07] aside_sue: what made you start playing hwei
[2:11:09] aside_sue: LUL
[2:11:13] yanjii: the problem I have with Hwei is that i tend to spam click my abilities, so the moment I throw one the next set of abilities is already active, I don't know if you know what i mean lol, so its hard for me to play this champ and id need to change my playstyle
[2:11:41] LuckyToine: !opgg
[2:11:41] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu

[2:12:06] ObsceneSanity: @yanjii its how he's meant to play if helps. pre mana item though, its rough
[2:12:21] georgo__: they did it on korea
[2:13:14] TomNova: they must not like your art

[2:14:14] Jazzoholic: @Darkcyter kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:14:16] kreumbly: @georgo__ If they did it for everywhere else they would likely lose a huge player base. some people (a lot of content creators) like to have lower ranked accounts for content creation, which is shitty but true
[2:14:21] ObsceneSanity: @yanjii ohh gotcha lol yeah its rough
[2:14:26] Niomah: Ok just popped in to say Howdy because I know I've been AWOL, had a couple days off and a zillion appointments :D Now I have to go change the litter box and clean and do laundry. Have a great stream, @KayPea
[2:14:50] idckdolphins: meanwhile Riot layed off so many people
[2:14:57] georgo__: tbh with the new items AP assassins is broken
[2:15:01] baPIMPski: I'm a gold player and every other game about, i get an Iron 1 on my team

[2:15:34] gnral_kenobi: Hello there

[2:15:58] TomNova: @ObsceneSanity thats actually gross x.x
[2:16:02] Jazzoholic: wait, what did i miss about hurricane..?
[2:16:06] backstreetalright: kaypVibe DinoDance
[2:16:11] lexaa023: Heyy girl how u doin :)
[2:16:39] ObsceneSanity: @TomNova I'm hoping its adjusted before it leaves pbe for live service, but i get the feeling it wont
[2:16:56] tardfard_mcnut: Q+E does a lot in those aoe fights
[2:16:56] Marleenu: i firmly believe that people that do balancing changes ect should atleast be diamond or higher to understand how to balance the game.. but unfortunately thats not a requirement what so ever
[2:17:28] Jazzoholic: sounds fudged up
[2:17:32] TomNova: like melee have tiamat ? why do they need that too
[2:17:34] aside_sue: i had ap xin zhao in my ranked gmae today and we lost cuz of it
[2:17:50] kreumbly: @TomNova ranged have tiamat as well
[2:17:50] aside_sue: every lane was winning but late game we got outmatched 4v5
[2:17:56] TomNova: @ObsceneSanity yeah i think so too, gonna be broke or a while then nurfed or changed LUL
[2:17:56] aside_sue: cuz xin was not doing shit

[2:18:48] ObsceneSanity: @Fremdo I was playing a game with panth on pbe and i can usually keep my empower up with panth combos but i was able to keep it up with AAs instead
[2:20:27] ObsceneSanity: -_- tahm was HEALING through darius' bleed!
[2:20:39] Fremdo: @obscenesanity That’s my worst nightmare bonchiCry
[2:20:51] kreumbly: honestly a liandry's is big this game i think. they have a lot of hp
[2:20:59] TomNova: am sorry D:
[2:21:03] xPreparedx: Your jungler and top have felt very poor. It's been very enjoyable watching you play / learn Hwei though. Nice change of pace.
[2:21:17] ObsceneSanity: @Fremdo if i play again later today i might try with quickblades and see if i can just keep an empowered w up at all times
[2:21:19] TomNova: i guess it wouldnt hurt for TK
[2:21:36] uphian: use more qe pls with ee in tfs

[2:22:17] Anko_Peru: horizon also feels very ood on hwei
[2:22:21] kreumbly: he does good burst but his ult does group aoe and his Q+E does constant aoe in groups and applies it so you get big value in teamfights with it
[2:22:21] Anko_Peru: good*
[2:22:26] kaithegemini: I like to go seraphs, liandrys so you can poke for ages

[3:01:11] luinardo: what I don't understand is how teammates will lose all decision making skills in your games but you check their mh and they have perfect scores in other games
[3:01:21] nassimiheb: With vayne scaling and karthus' it will be hard
[3:01:23] L0rentzi124: back in the days every new champ release felt more exciting and fitting for the game, not like nowadays :(

[3:05:30] The_KungFro: @L0rentzi124 I suppose it was either that or just wait for the end haha
[3:05:40] Darkcyter: @johnny479 WB
[3:05:41] mistermurr: Ah ok ok
[3:05:44] Gromzzz: some champs die easier than others it would be hard to use kda to judge performance
[3:05:45] AmberAnjuna: in went from E3 to P4 with games like this hahah
[3:06:14] MultiKILLBG: is this youre main account KP ?
[3:06:16] L0rentzi124: @The_KungFro ye behind 23 kills is rough, big lvl and item gap :)

[3:06:44] n1vlem: Santorin couldn't win that game!
[3:06:49] Darkcyter: @Tronkb WB
[3:06:54] Jazzoholic: it's like they go hunting for deaths
[3:07:07] georgo__: if you'd make performance based LP gain or lose everyone would care more for their KDA then winning
[3:07:11] steelxdawn: 0-5.....YEAH RIOTS HATES YOU
[3:07:12] Spajnal: LuvSign

[3:08:47] heia_ko: if they watch back the game, they will clearly thats there's a problem in matchmaking
[3:08:49] MelonDestiny: a streak of five, wins or losses, is pretty normal in statistics
[3:08:52] Darkcyter: I mean I may not be an expert, but you deserve diamond at least
[3:08:55] Jazzoholic: Conspiracy theorist @kaypea
[3:09:02] Gromzzz: match maker does make lose game the win ratios in solo q at best is 70 percent and that player is using the most broken champs he or she can find
[3:09:22] AllOfKingsPotato: BabyRage

[3:09:36] ObsceneSanity: T1 has been insanely harsh against the balance team after they approached him how he is able to point out wintraders
[3:09:39] POWnobodyNOW: Its difficult for me to feel sorry for Tyler, if anyone deserves it he does HypeLUL
[3:09:44] khadapys: i lost 10 games in one day :) but it was arams, RS and one or two ranked.

[3:10:56] ObsceneSanity: Twisted Fate has a high win rate in all 3 lanes bc of his ad build, but balancing team nerfed ap tf instead.
[3:10:57] 懂汪納督賣價博: hello ~ how is your day today

[3:13:00] Sammguy: the problem is one of policy. Riot balances their champs for pro play, which is not how 99.99999 percent of the player base plays their champs
[3:13:03] mistermurr: :O
[3:13:09] lewhitehd69: oh yh i saw the hurricane one, i mean its no way it goes to live
[3:13:14] mistermurr: O m g
[3:13:16] heia_ko: why
[3:13:18] ForeverWar: ForeverWar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months! Nearly 4 years! :D
[3:13:19] heia_ko: WHY DO THAT
[3:13:27] Omicroad: Riot balancing is really just throwing shit at the wall
[3:13:38] kreumbly: I think Viego is so broken. He has so much in his kit. Stun, dash, invis, movespeed, resetting ult, heal. like its just wayyy too much
[3:13:40] Darkcyter: @ForeverWar WB
[3:13:41] Ezkhel: @Darkcyter EZ Clap
[3:13:49] Dakotark: i cant wait to verse tons of katarinas <3 <3 how fun! =D
[3:14:00] jxyde_2353: we can’t commit to roles, tanks are dps all of a sudden, and now we are giving range champs melee?
[3:14:02] Skiddywags: if melee hurricane goes to live its gonna be a shit show
[3:14:05] steelxdawn: @Omicroad They play darts all day
[3:14:16] Ezkhel: Maybe they need to break everything down to build it back up properly LUL
[3:14:20] heia_ko: riot balancing shit must be around money. like aint that hard. also they accept boosted stuuf but not in esports
[3:14:22] heia_ko: ah ok
[3:14:41] HydroMerano: I actually feel sorry for Phreak, I am not gonna advocate for him and what he chooses to do or what the balance team chooses to do, but apparently he got a lot of death threats to the point he quit social media
[3:14:42] ObsceneSanity: its why mages are in a sad state bc pro play doesnt like strong mages in midlane
[3:14:43] wejustplayed: wait kay, Kobe himself was talking about that on the dive this week!
[3:14:56] Eimiix: i played a fun game of urf earlier today, 2 bronze on my team and 3 unranked. On the other team? 2 plats, 1 emerald, 1 gold and 1 diamond. What is with the matchmakingggg :(
[3:15:00] jakabolta: it honesty feel there is too much champs in game so it they nurf or buff anything somthing is gonna be broken any time
[3:15:04] georgo__: Voli was always volatile in the last 3-4 years, just remember when s12 voli walked around from jg and literally 1v4 a botlane fight
[3:15:15] HydroMerano: Yeah, I was shocked when I saw it, there was a video about it.
[3:15:22] wejustplayed: @KayPea - Kobe is the literally the most famous (internal anyways) voli one trick right? and even HE got on the dive and was like "holy fuck dude, this was way too much, like yall need to dial this back" lol
[3:15:23] georgo__: then nerfed to the ground where he couldn't solo raptors lvl2 :D
[3:15:27] Smoothcollie: That’s such a bullshit. You cannot buy Runaans now as a melee. What the actual fck is this, are they high or what?
[3:15:44] KinKaray: Rito has no proper Balancing team. They have a lot of people going "What would happen if I do this" and then we have things like never-ending Master Yi Q with a ranged item....
[3:15:45] ObsceneSanity: Toxic community gunna toxic
[3:15:47] HydroMerano: according to the thing I found on reddit, someone took a picture of his car in a parking lot and drew a bomb next to it, it was fucked.
[3:16:04] lewhitehd69: @KayPea wat did they do to voli?
[3:16:21] steelxdawn: @KinKaray true.....one guy makes the decision and everybody else is too scared to disagree lol
[3:16:26] ObsceneSanity: your team is soo squish. this is gunna be rough with voli
[3:16:28] FiveFM: briittHat  Bear Conspiracy!
[3:16:34] mistermurr: :O
[3:16:35] Jimbaloney: OOGA BOOGA
[3:16:38] jakabolta: tbh i would pref kyle for scaling
[3:16:46] HydroMerano: Hopefully Kayle can handle Voli
[3:16:48] HydroMerano: knock on wood.
[3:16:52] KatPanda: Hi hi KP how are the games today?
[3:17:01] steelxdawn: THIS GAME IS OVER.....gg team fights
[3:17:02] BiSettual: They comp is so good wow
[3:17:04] Mathiass003: i mean you have Kayle right?
[3:17:06] ericaborgest: I feel veigar is so good this season
[3:17:06] BiSettual: Their*
[3:17:07] AmaraSol: win or lose?
[3:17:12] KatPanda: I got diamond for the first time ever last night :") all these years have paid off
[3:17:12] Sammguy: first tower?
[3:17:14] HydroMerano: First tower?
[3:17:17] Jimbaloney: if voli will have more than 10 deaths
[3:17:17] steelxdawn: Prediction....HARD LOSE
[3:17:18] kreumbly: ehh i keep seeing people using the argument that "melee already has tiamat items" but like.. ranged are able to use tiamat items as well. I build tiamat items on vayne, ashe, corki etc.
[3:17:20] HydroMerano: @Sammguy High five. XD
[3:17:21] ObsceneSanity: enemy team has vayne PepeHands
[3:17:26] mistermurr: Will we win or not? XD
[3:17:37] heia_ko: runnan melee makes no sence to me. when i started it was an item for adc and used when ennemies is stacking while helping to your job without dying. i dont get it for melee at  all. are the so strugeling? The only melee i see is kayle as someone said ^^
[3:17:41] Gromzzz: ez is weak adc a good ez doesnt die atleast but ez carry not likely
[3:17:49] Sammguy: HydroMerano: XD
[3:17:56] FiveFM: kaypUpsetti  *Ahem*  cough cough
[3:18:04] ericaborgest: sending positive vibes this game will be a dub kaypHarmony kaypHarmony kaypHarmony
[3:18:15] Jimbaloney: runnan braum is disgusting
[3:18:21] Jothor83: this right here is the turning point i can feel it
[3:18:25] steelxdawn: i just bet 6000 on LOSE LUL
[3:18:25] heia_ko: thats the thing! they are brocken xD no reason
[3:18:25] HydroMerano: You got this KP! quantCheer
[3:18:30] Gromzzz: im not a believer of kayle carry either
[3:18:31] iBexi: 30k channel points on yes. nickiCute
[3:18:37] tacobean1: kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer
[3:18:38] Omicroad: Runaan yi is gonna be so disgusting
[3:18:41] iBexi: Let's go KP you beast. You got this
[3:18:44] kreumbly: @heia_ko I would agree with this but if they are going to say "don't give melee runaans" then they need to get rid of ranged being able to to tiamat items again.
[3:18:48] luciano_sm: guys has she won or lost 5 games in a row
[3:18:50] Omicroad: Refreshes his q faster
[3:18:52] Gromzzz: lux to carry for the win :)
[3:18:54] ericaborgest: kaypVibe kaypVibe
[3:18:55] L0rentzi124: 5 range champs, tf's gonna be poke only
[3:18:56] ObsceneSanity: @Omicroad if it goes through low elo is gunna suck
[3:19:17] Omicroad: Yeah
[3:19:19] heia_ko: @kreumbly totally agree with you
[3:19:25] Omicroad: He's already op there
[3:19:33] steelxdawn: kayle need 4 items to carry....
[3:19:37] heia_ko: @kreumbly i never built this so idk xD
[3:19:38] Rincewurst: @ObsceneSanity are you saying that right now it doesnt? Susge
[3:19:51] snarfiedoo: so you were doing trigonometry the past times?
[3:19:59] ObsceneSanity: @Rincewurst in comparison to the current level of suck we got now
[3:20:42] steelxdawn: gg top
[3:20:51] Rincewurst: @ObsceneSanity oh okay. thanks for clarifying. I almost reinstalled league Kappa
[3:20:59] Omicroad: Is that a winning bot lane?
[3:21:03] ObsceneSanity: Kappa have fun
[3:21:07] steelxdawn: Karma getting all the kills is bad
[3:21:19] Dakotark: tali's shoes were also untied
[3:21:22] mrshibasan: my worst first game ever I got bot and got anivia support that didn't bought a support item and she taking my exp
[3:21:25] Jimbaloney: ezreal supp? xd

[3:21:47] kreumbly: @heia_ko Champs like Corki, top vayne, some ashe builds and a few others build tiamat items for the extra waveclear. Like im all for melee not getting runaans, i think its a horrible decision but if they are going to not give them it, they need to make tiamat items melee only again.
[3:21:50] Jimbaloney: omg its the vietnam song
[3:21:59] ericaborgest: you're farming well
[3:22:07] snarfiedoo: KKona GuitarTime
[3:22:09] ObsceneSanity: this song is fitting for how todays game went
[3:22:20] Mathiass003: taliyah jungle is still a thing?
[3:22:27] Dakotark: pantheon left lane and vayne died, what a great time to write smthing in all-chat
[3:22:34] ObsceneSanity: @Mathiass003 very. shes very strong
[3:22:35] Omicroad: Melees don't need any help lol
[3:22:57] steelxdawn: whos gonna deal with volibear LOL
[3:22:58] ericaborgest: !cannon
[3:22:58] Nightbot: KayPea has missed: 1224 cannon minions Clap
[3:24:02] Dakotark: well, now vely doesnt have r for a minute
[3:24:10] kalpaf: hey kelsie girl
[3:24:22] ObsceneSanity: just need to make it to 30m
[3:24:24] heia_ko: @kreumbly agree with you, but the difference here is split pushing vs hyper melee carry that can carry even more?  i could be wrong, runan also helps for wave clear. but other than that i agree, but they also remove gale force and thats a huge miss to consider
[3:24:32] mrshibasan: im suprise your using this skin again miss kaypea
[3:24:49] Omicroad: An actual bot lane, let's go SeemsGood
[3:24:51] wejustplayed: wait i just checked voli's notes again and i forgot the FIFTY-SIX  PERCENT move speed increase
[3:24:58] kalpaf: OMEGALUL
[3:24:58] L0rentzi124: lol so awkward

[3:26:53] Darkcyter: kaypLUL
[3:26:53] ericaborgest: bait**
[3:27:20] phreak43: isn't the worth of the play determined by who said it first?
[3:27:23] backstreetalright: lux gains kaypComfy
[3:27:30] Omicroad: That was funny, Kels baited by her own usual tricks
[3:27:45] ObsceneSanity: lux w still needs a rework.
[3:27:50] heia_ko: like most of the runes especially like lethal tempo ore phase rush works better on melee than adc, or mages thats also why I though runnan is lil abusif. ok i stop now sorry ^^'
[3:28:05] steelxdawn: Let hope volibear does not build magic resist
[3:28:44] kontishu: hello!
