Also, physically tell her off, she'll love and respect you more cause you show that you're an alpha, confident and high value man.

Ingame if you want to optimize the gains of your relationships, you should scream at your girlfriend how much better you are than her in every aspect of everything. Also, physically tell her off, she'll love and respect you more cause you show that you're an alpha, confident and high value man.
