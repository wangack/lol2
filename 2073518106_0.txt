[1:33:22] daarius01: THATS WHY
[1:33:30] daarius01: thats why i didnt pull any one with my w
[1:33:56] Colarboy: yeah they made aatrox w even more useless than it was

[1:34:03] Colarboy: RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT
[1:34:04] The_Alternis: he wasnt even outside the area when it disapeared lmao

[1:34:35] ItsPowers0: w shouldn't even be a spell
[1:34:42] angelo_g1: nerfed serylda's nerfed w , WELL PLAYED RIOT
[1:34:46] Irish_Lemur: wait what is he talking about
[1:35:08] Colarboy: they should increase the the slow on W and if aatrox is op they should nerf other parts of his kit
[1:35:14] The_Alternis: aatrox w ground effect
[1:35:16] Colarboy: this nerf is just stupid
[1:35:19] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[1:35:24] z3urnwi: they kinda need to idk
[1:35:28] daarius01: for basically free
[1:35:29] MrFaby69: @Naayil it barely pulled before now never fair play rito for nerfing a nice tech feature
[1:35:30] daarius01: lol
[1:35:32] daarius01: not really...
[1:35:43] chrono_ward: W should become grounding imo
[1:35:47] stealthwolf23: stealthwolf23 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to Naayil's community! They've gifted a total of 7 in the channel! 
[1:35:48] stealthwolf23: stealthwolf23 gifted a Tier 1 sub to tiler08! 
[1:35:51] Splitshot_Is_Here: one of the replies to your tweet was the most cope response I've ever heard, saying this is intended because "they didn't want to change when the damage applies but only the cc" or some shit
[1:35:52] elBoss44: they won't
[1:35:55] RaposoEstiloso: W is dead so now we will get the revive back RIOT
[1:36:10] chicana798: @Naayil When we getting a house tour?
[1:36:21] s_xf_s: nerf it now so that aatrox might as well be down a spell sadge
[1:36:23] ShuIkin: what did they change on w i dont get it? the flash pull? @Naayil
[1:36:43] Splitshot_Is_Here: inb4 they give aatrox W the tether range buff that they gave to some of the other champs
[1:36:44] daarius01: @ShuIkin yeah
[1:36:55] sonwukos: they nerfed his tenacity by 20 percent
[1:37:05] Arisaka_: now it actually lookes bugged LULE
[1:37:06] Colarboy: but then aatrox w becomes actual cosmetic ability KEKW
[1:37:10] MrFaby69: @Naayil  it barely pulled before now never fair play rito for nerfing a nice tech feature
[1:37:22] daarius01: @ShuIkin so basically if they leave the w before the 0,25 sec animation they still get pulled, but not anymore
[1:37:28] EXxnightingale: they basically made all tether abilities useless
[1:37:30] x_ninja_10m: Nerf aatrox in his W is very bad

[1:37:54] Arexbtw: bro since the change I cant pull anyone on lane only in teamfights
[1:37:54] x_ninja_10m: Actually his w now as it hasn't
[1:37:55] Feline1: you have so much coke you could be from mexico :D
[1:37:55] martynassupermenas: now they made that w just helps your pasive
[1:37:58] deity_gamez: if you're flashing out of w and still getting pulled you flashed WAY too late. should be punished for making mistakes. not saved
[1:38:05] angelo_g1: they're using wood pc's to code the game
[1:38:07] Kaomos: Wont revert tf changes or nerf karma mid though :D
[1:38:07] MrFaby69: @Naayil that tech was in the game since his rework but it took like what 4/5 years for it ? xdxd
[1:38:15] kangster_1: i just joined, r u mad cuz riot nerfed him or buffed him for no reason
[1:38:17] elBoss44: spaghetti code
[1:38:25] elBoss44: rarely
[1:38:26] MrFaby69: 1/5 games
[1:38:27] ShuIkin: once in 10 games
[1:38:40] chompstercomes: GG
[1:38:47] nightm4regr: same thing happened to ksante. the patch notes says adjustments. i mean yea, they are some good buffs but most of them are nerfs
[1:38:53] daarius01: true
[1:38:54] daarius01: real
[1:39:01] Colarboy: aatrox nerf should have been sundered sky nerf
[1:39:12] chompstercomes: its better to nerf broken champs than too buff evreyone to broken
[1:39:17] kitkatik125: do u still enjoying masturbation?
[1:39:18] MrFaby69: @Naayil that tech was in the game since his rework but it took like what 4/5 years for it ? xdxd they are high af
[1:39:28] AtheistMonke_: That sweatshirt is fire bro
[1:39:29] drrrEist: is bc now good again in tank matchups?
[1:39:32] elBoss44: if you flash/dash in the last 0.25 second you deserve to be pulled
[1:39:35] nightm4regr: @Colarboy but then they would nerf sundered sky in general not just on aatrox
[1:39:37] EXxnightingale: didnt they nerf tether abilities cuz of noc???
[1:39:42] daarius01: rate water /10
[1:39:52] s_xf_s: I am genuinely curious on why it is so difficult for Riot to listen to the community when it comes to balancing
[1:39:53] MrFaby69: same here not gonna lie
[1:39:57] MrFaby69: XD
[1:39:58] Nicholai_Deus: ok riot, but when the fix for passive?
[1:40:04] CheStalin: every inconsistent thing should be removed from league physics in the game should be predictable
[1:40:08] Colarboy: @nightm4regr yes exactly if they nerf sundered sky then aatrox is in a fine spot
[1:40:09] MrFaby69: intresting buff nerf team nayil :)))
[1:40:10] daarius01: lol
[1:40:10] kitkatik125: @Naayil do u still enjoying masturbation?
[1:40:19] satyyaa: stonks
[1:40:21] satyyaa: if they buff him
[1:40:24] EXxnightingale: THEY WILLL
[1:40:31] AtheistMonke_: I would cream my pants
[1:40:35] daarius01: they perma ban it for sure
[1:40:36] kangster_1: Yo naayil have u seen any kayle players in high elo?
[1:40:47] angelo_g1: i mean they are
[1:40:47] MrFaby69: @Naayil for real once a month they should let high elo players like top 300 to buff nerc champs i might be tripping but they have no idea what to do with champ buffs nerfs xd
[1:40:50] zeph2k: his win rate is not even that high across all ranks
[1:40:55] AtheistMonke_: HAS THERE EVER BEEN ANY DOUBT THEY ARE?
[1:41:16] l0mt: guess we'll see
[1:41:19] sonwukos: if they buff aatrox its over bros gonna be perma banned
[1:41:19] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[1:41:21] daarius01: isnt client bugged for 14 years as well?
[1:41:26] angelo_g1: meanwhile nasus slows for 90%
[1:41:27] MrFaby69: healing increased by 10% @Naayil KEKW
[1:41:32] AtheistMonke_: Buff Q to have 200% dmg scale
[1:41:35] mglolll: does aatrox win against azir
[1:41:39] chrono_ward: wont be able to play him since hell always be banned
[1:41:46] fedeslow: Buff with second dash :)
[1:41:55] RedFoxFFS: wanna play clash? we need one more xdd
[1:42:01] hasan7v7: The w is the core of his kit though so they need to do something with it not just buff
[1:42:03] Splitshot_Is_Here: I can understand fixing it because apparently it is a bug at the end of the day, but they didn't actually fix anything. The bug now just exists in the opposite direction
[1:42:14] shinsora_: it kinda sucks how people say aatrox is a skillless champ because of his buff this season
[1:42:19] EXxnightingale: @fedeslow Imagine
[1:42:19] sonwukos: is black cleaver more viable now @Naayil
[1:42:20] mglolll: !buff
[1:42:21] MrFaby69: @Naayil I Won today against a vayne otp poor guy was adc filled top and nad no idea how to play top matchups and said aatrox enjoyer KEKW
[1:42:30] kangster_1: do u think it would help if riot had got all the "league player on Twitch" and just had a long seminar on how to save the game with all of ur guys' thought on the game
[1:42:33] daarius01: @shinsora_ what buff lol
[1:42:49] nightm4regr: @shinsora_ he is skillless and broken either way
[1:42:53] bleus23: !patch
[1:43:05] angelo_g1: and after 5 years they decided to "fix" it
[1:43:10] hasan7v7: it makes one of his abilities just non existent all of a sudden
[1:43:16] shinsora_: daarius01 i mean his items "buff" this season with sundered sky and shojin compared to last season
[1:43:22] Boldigeci: This is different, it's just a bug due to how often the game updates during gameplay
[1:43:37] Splitshot_Is_Here: I mean yeah, they didn't fix it, they just reversed the bug and called it a fix
[1:43:39] s_xf_s: it took 5 years for them to "fixed" it, clearly it was intended to be a feature
[1:43:40] daarius01: @shinsora_ oh ok
[1:43:44] EXxnightingale: was in history of aatrox where he wasnt ''BUGGED''
[1:43:52] MrFaby69: @Naayil my passive auto still doesnt go off sometimes :)))))))
[1:43:53] mglolll: what did they change in aatrox?
[1:43:54] deity_gamez: someone at riot flashed out of w and still got pulled
[1:44:18] totojavaviewer: maybe they "fixed" aatrox passive to prevent buggy interaction with new runaan
[1:44:18] shinsora_: about which champ are we talking right now?
[1:44:19] chimbotrain: @deity_gamez ^
[1:44:24] Boldigeci: It was an issue with every single tether, they just didn't care
[1:44:25] MrFaby69: @Naayil they should nerf flashing out of rengar q also cause is bluetooth KEKW
[1:44:32] daarius01: phreak probably watched some w bluetooth montage on tiktok and got scared
[1:44:45] Yarosh8: "we are fixing aatrox bug when q knocked up champions"
[1:44:45] sherdilxd: it could be looked at as, well they were gonna fix it later or later
[1:44:48] hasan7v7: phreak got pulled by an aatrox w
[1:44:52] EXxnightingale: FAAK RIOT PHREAK
[1:44:53] shinsora_: totojavaviewer did aatrox passive get nerfed? or about which champ are we talking?
[1:45:16] MrFaby69: @Naayil i won today against a vayne top filled from adc and poor guy said aatrox enjoyer KEKW
