[2:05:22] xcalebur: ksante doesnt want to be in auto trade with olaf early
[2:05:40] raaboh: You can indicate spell range with alt and q-w-er
[2:05:49] raaboh: No need to click
[2:07:15] 1upduds: @raaboh isnt alt the standard key to self cast a skill?
[2:07:18] maciastwardy: zilean make this lane ever harder
[2:07:41] RukiHyena: @1upduds allot of ppl rebind it to selfcast
[2:07:58] RukiHyena: could even rebind it to level up skills
[2:08:12] maciastwardy: that ult
[2:08:16] raaboh: @1upduds is it? I dont know what is the standard for it
[2:08:27] raaboh: I usw ctrl to lvl up
[2:08:47] 1upduds: i could swear alt was the standard for self cast and shift the standard to show range
[2:08:59] xcalebur: i use shift to self, ctrl for ranges and alt to lvl
[2:09:12] xcalebur: had it this way since s1
[2:09:24] raaboh: Maybe i rebound it, but it was back in s3 when i started
[2:09:25] RukiHyena: shift is default yes
[2:09:31] maciastwardy: i think hubris is not good choice with this zilean xd
[2:09:37] raaboh: Alt feels more natural to me
