[4:48:36] zizoi2: SHIVER IN MY SPAIN
[4:48:38] ShibikoX: They don't post much about it, I been getting insights from the devs. But it's going to get better with riot's version of true skill 2.   But currently it does a mix of winrate and how you play in game. It focus's more on how you play. Like the trades you do and gold leads. Not so much on the k/d/a. It has the new goal to rank you up faster than the previous systems that liked to hard lock you vs other smurfs.
[4:48:40] zizoi2: SPINE
[4:48:46] Caliburen: lmfao my spain

[4:59:08] TurboGigaBeast: bloddsong?
[4:59:17] Caliburen: or bloodsong yeah
[4:59:20] Nightbot: Follow my socials! Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@bobqinxd Twitter: https://twitter.com/bobqinXD  IG: https://www.instagram.com/bobqinxd/  Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@bobqinxd

[4:59:34] Hellhound298: atlas transfers into those
[4:59:39] TurboGigaBeast: bloodsong gives extra dmg on hit
[4:59:58] Caliburen: @bobqinxd after you get 1k gold from world atlas you pick bloodsong or zaks
[5:00:14] Caliburen: then after that you go usual ap items
[5:00:22] Hellhound298: @Caliburen ^ this
[5:01:44] Caliburen: most of the "ap" support items dont resonate with lb so you're fine to do your full ap build
[5:02:13] Hellhound298: Once you get 1k gold on the world atlas, you get to choose one out of the 5 options
[5:02:51] Caliburen: yes
[5:03:02] Zevren423: poke or kill minons to get gold
[5:03:04] Caliburen: yes
[5:03:08] thegirthfather: earn gold by last hitting minons or hitting enemies with spells
[5:03:13] Luke1328: You get to pick an item once its fully filled upgraded whatever
[5:03:17] thegirthfather: 1000 gold you choose the evolution
[5:03:18] cihro1: as a cook its important to taste the food of other prominent chefs
[5:03:23] Caliburen: you get more gold for hitting people but it can also be used as a relic stack
[5:03:38] Caliburen: its much better to use it as relic for canon
[5:04:06] Hellhound298: bro you kidnapped my maokai in the game i played vs you
[5:04:12] Hellhound298: took him from river to under t1
[5:05:00] Caliburen: @bobqinxd BTW there is an interaction if you get the gold debuff you cant use it as a relic stack
[5:05:09] Caliburen: at 500 gold you get wards
[5:05:12] Caliburen: up to 3
