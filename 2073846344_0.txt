[3:16:04] Druss__: Voli had a smite window, just missed it
[3:16:04] samshananigans: doesnt it flash to 750 at one point?
[3:16:04] exileddc: pink ward is either 0/8 or hes one shotting everything

[3:16:59] darkesther0: well supports get alot of gold
[3:17:07] darkesther0: so it doesnt rlly matter what they pick
[3:17:15] Praetor_GG: that's why League makes no sense, support supposed to have the least gold
[3:17:16] Derp_sanity: there is no such thing as support anymore. its just another damage role.
[3:17:16] Clordd98: damage dealing supports are in, senna and ashe
[3:17:17] guy_onthemoon: can’t tell who’s more cancerous shaco or hwei
[3:17:17] darkesther0: support items rlly strong
[3:17:23] toop: legit
[3:17:26] pandorelol: Bloodsong creates careers
[3:17:32] samshananigans: death timers need to be longer you die 5+ times early game and only down 1 level
[3:17:38] Praetor_GG: @guy_onthemoon hwei at least has a high skill cap, shaco does not
[3:17:42] ofernteixe: karma come and q+r half of your life out of the blue
[3:17:46] Misterpoody: well, they spend 400 gold on a full item, and then then get 1000 gold bonus for existing.
[3:17:54] pescabacalhau: Play atrox
[3:17:56] takash87: hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[3:18:17] o_cricketeer: Nemesis was talking about this yesterday.. Its why adc feels so bad to play right now too
[3:18:19] Senpai_noticed: uh oh 3 mid mains monkaW
[3:18:27] darkesther0: shaco?

[3:18:32] briizzath: u said permabanshaco xD
[3:18:34] pescabacalhau: Can you play aatrox
[3:18:35] vvill: dw someone on the rito team will get shit on by a shaco supp then it wil get nerfed
[3:18:41] Clordd98: its like when people played twitch support a couple seasons back and the cheese was just as bad, invis champs in general are tough
[3:18:42] wise_mystical_tree__: FishMoley
[3:18:42] Senpai_noticed: @darkesther0 his teammate did already
[3:18:42] Blaz29: someone already banned shaco chat
[3:18:44] betorino: bro if you play in his area obviously you lose
[3:18:47] darkesther0: oh ;p
[3:18:50] betorino: is like fighting teemo
[3:18:52] ofernteixe: karma just do too much damage and absurd shield
[3:18:56] wise_mystical_tree__: FirstTimeBackseating
[3:18:56] Nheat: ban the champion that's already banned FeelsDankMan
[3:19:04] Praetor_GG: passive gold nerf
[3:19:08] ofernteixe: nerf the support item?
[3:19:13] takash87: eazy pob you caaan handle it
[3:19:16] Ozube: remove bloodsong self amp damage
[3:19:23] Gods_Favorit3: its not just shaco tho champs like pantheon support does a fck ton of dmg
[3:19:24] Praetor_GG: incentivize support to stay tf bot
[3:19:40] eMbbuZomg: shaco only did 700 dmg to baron
[3:19:41] gewarsky: well shaco had 10 kills before he started one tapping
[3:19:45] betorino: what about new runnan
[3:19:45] ofernteixe: return to seson 1 ? they have to buy every ward
[3:19:49] takash87: y  were handle it before
[3:19:57] Gods_Favorit3: it is the item
[3:20:00] FuwafuwaYui: remove support ok
[3:20:03] DizzierDizzi: Let supports cook
[3:20:06] omgcandylol: game was better when 90% of support gold went in to wards
[3:20:07] born___confused: @Praetor_GG roaming suppurt good Okayeg
[3:20:19] Praetor_GG: the other one is pretty fucked up too, % hp dmg on support is monkaLaugh
[3:20:20] Nheat: let's go back to philo stone HoG days FeelsOldMan
[3:20:20] ofernteixe: if they remove the support item and everyone can buy green ward LUL
[3:20:21] Clordd98: its a way to speed up games, riot wants to keep people interested and the thought of playing for 40-50 minutes isnt for everyone
[3:20:30] itsTOKOtv: Have a time lock until supports can buy another item
[3:20:40] samshananigans: support should  be just that support for the team not carrying from early game on
[3:20:44] Praetor_GG: YEP
[3:20:48] itsTOKOtv: Let them roam but only with 1 items
[3:20:56] ofernteixe: yes
[3:21:04] born___confused: peepoRiot nerf them
[3:21:06] kiddnapethemoney: u making supp look op
[3:21:06] unagi_densetsu: NODDERS
[3:21:06] ofernteixe: support is an absurd role right now
[3:21:08] notohkae: play support
[3:21:12] Praetor_GG: roam is fine if you get punished for doing nothing, but passive gold erases  that
[3:21:17] 8iggy12: season 14 is the culmunation of zoomers/gen alphas playing the game and the attention span of the average player going down
[3:21:24] samshananigans: they get almst 0 punish for roam as well
[3:21:25] Gods_Favorit3: agree, support is the new mid lane
[3:21:31] ofernteixe: yes
[3:21:39] fruvis: they have forsaken the support to degrees no one couldve seen
[3:21:42] 8iggy12: a slower paced game = decreased players
[3:21:45] DreamSmasher89: game name;?
[3:21:48] ofernteixe: it's worse than evelyn
[3:21:51] omgcandylol: everyone has to feel like theyre useful so now supports do hella damage
[3:22:11] marlie__chiller: should be easier to punish the ad who got ditched
[3:22:16] eMbbuZomg: now YOU get to have the shaco support
[3:22:17] born___confused: season 14 YEP
[3:22:18] bonedbybear: play Garen top plz
[3:22:20] Garnene: maybe you should just start playing support
[3:22:23] vvill: if adcs werent so weak this wouldnt happen
[3:22:23] Cadaver_Waltz: sacho
[3:22:24] borichorichap: maybe its new meta?
[3:22:34] Praetor_GG: support was always useful ---- for helping carries get ahead
[3:22:34] bossthelevel: Pink cord starts doran's blade and q, with Halo blades he does insane damage level 1
[3:22:35] noctroewich: Do you think things like no armor runes have had a big impact
[3:22:43] ofernteixe: they can last hit minions almost half hp
[3:23:24] Clordd98: i think the problem isnt the support champs i think theres just an inbalance in the whole game from so many changes at once
[3:23:27] cpr_solojayson: @noctroewich que up and youll see an unkillable bruiserwith heal runes
[3:23:30] Praetor_GG: into the pavement ok
[3:23:35] ofernteixe: they want ppl to play support
[3:23:42] Gods_Favorit3: i believe its due to the lack of support players
[3:23:55] Fade_SS: instalocking Kappa
[3:23:57] Praetor_GG: @Clordd98 I mean the passive gold is clearly a problem by the definition of support
[3:24:02] takash87: now he is in your team hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:24:13] Fade_SS: i think its a dodge
[3:24:17] ofernteixe: not only the gold, but the item is too strong
[3:24:27] Praetor_GG: far more people playing supp than jg

[3:25:28] MalahPls: Thoughts on your boomer audience?
[3:25:36] Druss__: I don't think shaco support is that much pf a problem.  Just a glass cannon that doesn't really actually offer much to the team other than high burst.
[3:25:45] Clordd98: i think the passive gold is a way to let the support stay in the game in certain matchups, remembering its not all supports you have an issue with its just the strong ones @praetor_gg
[3:25:45] Cadaver_Waltz: i think nidalee is shitalee
[3:25:52] KaizenTheDisciple: tarzaned thinks nidalee is too team reliant this season
[3:26:04] eMbbuZomg: nidalee is #1 winrate is it not
[3:26:07] Spooferproofn: why did midalee die?
[3:26:19] themilanmiracle: could it be a placebo effect?
[3:26:36] ofernteixe: support have an item better than sheen paying 400g D:  after using an ability, your next basic attack within 10 seconds deals 150% base AD bonus physical damage on-hit.
