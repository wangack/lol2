[0:45:17] Flarezard: riot patched it so you can't be high elo player while playing against those way lower than u
[0:45:33] TerraSage: One thing I noticed in Gold is that a lot of junglers try to overforce plays in ganks. They aren't satisfied by just getting the enemy ADC to flash. It basically makes the enemy snowball so hard
[0:45:55] Skever_: who do you think is best solo queue support player

[0:54:59] hemlo_it_me: Hey, I've recently been using Milio to climb and I want to know if he takes heal for the reason I assume he does. (weak walk up pressure so he has to play back, leaving ingite and exhaust lower value)

[0:56:00] Skever_: milio is pure cuck champ
[0:56:05] Trollflix: heal is good for Milio, cuz it procs Aery + you have heal & shield power items
[0:56:15] viiic2: seeing your zyra reminds me why i perma ban her stuntCry
[0:56:18] TerraSage: I really wanna be better at Milio but I feel like I can barely win games with him
[0:56:27] bluegazer1: wtf is up with ryzes name
[0:56:33] Twicecast: i thought we hated zyra

[0:56:41] Trollflix: heals also procs moonstone
[0:56:41] viiic2: we hate zyra
[0:56:44] garlicdaifuku: milio is very team dependent

[0:58:11] Flarezard: nah rengar doesnt ever want to play for mid this patch
[0:58:13] therealbeepo: Zyra .my fav
[0:58:13] Telperion16: She's very good against 3sh

[0:58:55] Twicecast: my jungler playing around my 0/8 toplaner for fun
[0:59:06] hemlo_it_me: @Coolykid12 Honestly I feel like Milio is one of the stronger Enchanters rn. But that's just my preference to play around large sheilds.
[0:59:14] Twicecast: is that senna top HUH
[0:59:20] nucularspider: i love Ryze's name

[1:00:35] hemlo_it_me: Sona is also a decent enchanter rn but I feel she is super team dependent where other enchanters can find 1 carry, sona needs the team to be doing well together to be as useful.

[5:50:25] trademe4acornchip: its terminus
[5:50:41] thebubinatoor: @mute_mousou Dear honorable person, I highly and respectfully disagree
[5:50:58] denunciator: depends on what you mean by niche but stuff like graph theory is used all the time
[5:51:07] Pirsigma: I remember out proffesor saying "you'll learn if you're cut for being an engineer in this class" in our first dif. equations class
[5:51:14] Telperion16: Math is important for young people bc it teaches problem a lot of other abilities required to do math
[5:51:18] denunciator: is category theory still niche?

[5:53:36] Kiiyorin: the tether broke
[5:53:50] denunciator: the one that makes tethers break the moment people are out of range rahter than on fixed ticks
[5:54:01] oliver_boi: if they break it with flash the tether doesnt stay even if u follow the flash unless u flash first

[5:54:23] BaneBladeV: I'm gonna copy paste the RIOT essay
[5:54:26] marciasd2: you like classical music?
[5:54:31] BaneBladeV: Have you ever had a moment where a LeBlanc E or Morgana ultimate tether was attached to you, but you saved your flash to get out of range at the last second only to get stunned anyway? This type of situation occurred with tethers due to the use of server frame checking which resulted in server ticks where the tether range was exceeded but did not break. In this patch, we're updating tethers to use area checking, which means that they should now break instantly, making these abilities more respon

[7:26:35] Balldropper: chat, I went to make some foods. Did we win the senna game?
[7:26:41] revrsedcodex: @foltann xd, he has a map
[7:26:41] avuloseunda: @foltann D:

[7:27:02] Kiiyorin: ye
[7:27:03] marciasd2: @foltann that was a surrender from the enemy
[7:27:04] CameraOnLocked: senna game was secured
[7:27:11] revrsedcodex: @foltann wdym
[7:27:21] Balldropper: @avuloseunda did we win the senna game?

[7:28:33] honoredbalzac: Noway :(
[7:28:42] avuloseunda: @balldropper i didn't see :(
[7:28:44] foltann: @revrsedcodex if they blame everything on me and then say than they dont ahve a sup and wtf am i doing while getting 3 kills for my team idk if he have a map
[7:28:49] avuloseunda: I'm busy at work :c
[7:28:52] foltann: taht*
[7:29:00] oliver_boi: bugged Kappa
[7:29:01] marciasd2: why roa?
[7:29:02] Balldropper: @avuloseunda all goods. got the response from chat + stunt. Hope you are doing well <3
[7:29:29] Kiiyorin: @foltann try your best. If anyone talks too much or is toxic.. mute
[7:29:58] revrsedcodex: @foltann if you're making big plays that are impacting the game state elsewhere, your adc is delusional mute asap
[7:30:07] foltann: @Kiiyorin i want to insult them too ...
[7:30:13] Kiiyorin: I mean, no one plays ranked to throw. Ppl have good and bad games
[7:30:22] Kiiyorin: @foltann what's the point of that tho?
[7:30:50] foltann: @Kiiyorin  makes me feel better
[7:31:03] Kiiyorin: Not really worth it imo
[7:31:20] revrsedcodex: @foltann SOMETIMES if it's volatile matchup I will ask, or tell my adc I'm roaming for an objective
[7:31:32] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[7:31:32] foltann: i want to see pings from them tho
[7:31:38] Apostolique: classic
[7:31:52] Apostolique: ADC brain
[7:32:12] revrsedcodex: @foltann you can mute chat and not pings, or just ignore them, what elo if you don't mind me asking
[7:32:15] Kiiyorin: F adc gave up
[7:33:37] foltann: @revrsedcodex this seasonj i playterd like 5 games and im g1 and i was plat with emerald mmr last season
[7:34:40] revrsedcodex: @foltann well in that case, make sure you analyze your roams to make sure they're actually good, just assume they're wrong
[7:34:59] revrsedcodex: "assume adc typing is wrong"
[7:35:04] BaneBladeV: nt
[7:35:08] jjennukka: Kaisa damage ow
[7:35:17] Kiiyorin: @foltann Personally, I went into league after years of dota. Ppl were far more toxic in that game. If someone tilts you, mute. That's the best advice I can give. Else you will never climb
[7:35:30] sscrollss: @foltann I just give me adc a couple caution pings, let them know I‚Äôm roaming, and if they die unlucky, but it‚Äôs best to roam when ur adc is getting shoved in not when he‚Äôs shoved
[7:35:39] foltann: @revrsedcodex ik im trying to impact the map as much as i can
[7:36:08] foltann: @sscrollss but he blames me so it tilts me so yea
[7:36:14] marciasd2: @Kiiyorin are they actually? I played dota too and I had the opposite experience/ same experience
[7:36:26] foltann: even if they ping me twicec iam tilted a littl;e already
[7:36:31] foltann: and start autopiloting
[7:36:36] revrsedcodex: @foltann analyze your roams to make sure every roam you're bot isn't losing something is what I'm saying
[7:36:40] BaneBladeV: KEKW
[7:36:41] Apostolique: noooo
[7:36:42] Kiiyorin: @marciasd2 I am SEA server, sadly
[7:37:11] marciasd2: @Kiiyorin oh okay, Im EU
[7:37:12] BaneBladeV: geoguessr was good when it didn't give you 5 minutes every hour anyway
[7:37:20] revrsedcodex: @foltann I gtg tho gl games bro <3
[7:37:24] sscrollss: @foltann that‚Äôs what I mean by sometimes you get unlucky, some adcs don‚Äôt understand, some are just tilted, not much you can do other than mute and let them know
[7:37:27] foltann: @revrsedcodex yes but if i want to set up the wave so i can roam he pings me
[7:37:35] yonays: lets do pokedle owo
[7:37:36] foltann: @revrsedcodex u too
[7:37:39] BaneBladeV: kind
[7:37:42] Kiiyorin: @marciasd2 learnt how to curse in 3 diff language playing doto xD
[7:38:11] foltann: @sscrollss ikik but the urge to tell them to k9s
[7:38:29] BaneBladeV: EZ
[7:38:50] revrsedcodex: @foltann no need to force waves, let things play out and play off of what happens, not other way around
[7:38:52] BaneBladeV: the last set is always ???
[7:39:09] sscrollss: @foltann I genuinely just mute myself so fast, I don‚Äôt mute all bc that can hinder me, but muting yourself quickly saves a lot of tilt and chat bans
[7:39:49] sscrollss: oh shit you got the 3.5% drop
[7:39:56] BaneBladeV: cafe cuties gwen AYAYA
[7:40:04] BaneBladeV: streamer luck
[7:40:08] jjennukka: Streamer luck
[7:40:36] BaneBladeV: DIESOFCRINGE all champ shards
[7:40:41] foltann: @revrsedcodex yea but i want to help my team as much as i can while my adc cant die
[7:40:48] sscrollss: nah the grab bag from the orb is 3.5% then has like another 1% for like a legendary skin or smt
[7:40:55] foltann: @sscrollss prob will start doing that tbh
[7:40:57] avuloseunda: 1 key and 67 chests D:
[7:41:07] avuloseunda: I have 14 keys no chests :(
[7:41:17] revrsedcodex: @foltann then make sure they can't die, and if they shouldn't die and do then that's not on you
[7:41:23] sscrollss: @foltann yea I‚Äôm coming off a 2 week so i can‚Äôt tilt and flame
[7:41:25] BaneBladeV: smolder pls <3
[7:41:37] foltann: jhin sup
[7:41:37] czekczek1: sejuani
[7:41:40] Kiiyorin: @foltann remember this. Your champs/items/networth resets from game to game. Your mental state carries over. Mute toxic ppl and just try your best

[7:42:47] aceshotzz_: Nami +1
[7:42:51] rosalbba: zoe picked SadgeCry
[7:42:55] BaneBladeV: changing to nami
[7:42:55] revrsedcodex: @foltann plays like that don't take long and don't allow for adc to be vulnerable, good to do early in the gsme for example
[7:42:55] jona288q: alistar
[7:42:58] foltann: @revrsedcodex my adc would die anyways
[7:43:05] Kiiyorin: 3 nami

[7:43:25] revrsedcodex: @foltann then reset slightly before them and go mid quick it takes 2 seconds
[7:43:27] foltann: @revrsedcodex its 15 s
[7:43:35] foltann: @revrsedcodex thats what i do
[7:43:39] foltann: after we push
[7:43:44] foltann: i laeve earlier
[7:43:58] foltann: so i can cleare wards and get vision
[7:44:38] czekczek1: when do you take gathering storm over scorch?
[7:44:41] revrsedcodex: I'm tired, give ign
[7:44:48] Kiiyorin: no scorth?
[7:45:06] Kiiyorin: I see
[7:45:37] revrsedcodex: @czekczek1 gathering can also be impactful if your abilities have abnormally high ad/ap ratios
[7:46:31] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[7:47:14] revrsedcodex: @foltann what's your ign I'm going sleep

[7:50:03] Kiiyorin: nvm
[7:50:41] revrsedcodex: @foltann nothing comes up
[7:50:53] foltann: @revrsedcodex some games im just half asleep so i might it but still
[7:50:56] foltann: @revrsedcodex eune ?
[7:51:01] revrsedcodex: @foltann ah
[7:51:16] foltann: int *
[7:51:43] BaneBladeV: @foltann if you get tilted after 2 pings, better to deafen at start and use your own awareness to figure out what's going on
[7:51:44] Kiiyorin: ip panth lane
[7:51:47] Kiiyorin: *rip
[7:52:02] foltann: @banebladeuwu ill start doing that i think
[7:52:11] thirdphoenix: any tips for playing nami?
[7:52:27] revrsedcodex: @foltann neither of your last 2 games were kill lanes, so if you left for 15 seconds and he died then skill issue
[7:52:54] revrsedcodex: @foltann gtg fr tho gl future games
[7:53:33] sscrollss: @foltann ngl if u get tilted after 2 pings and need to deafen u might need a break, or learn some people just ping too much because they like informing their tm8s, could be multiple reasons but usually they‚Äôre not tilted (hopefully)
[7:54:03] foltann: @revrsedcodex u too
[7:54:13] pcmouse_lol: Do you like Nami on this state of the game?
[7:54:44] foltann: @sscrollss no if it a ping that helps im not tilted but like if he dies and ping me and "?" ping me like idk
[7:54:49] foltann: i just get so tilted
[7:54:55] foltann: and lose my mind
[7:55:21] czekczek1: @foltann ?
[7:55:34] foltann: @czekczek1 hm ?
[7:55:35] pcmouse_lol: Patch/season 14
[7:55:41] b3llamy: u gotta just ignore ppl
[7:55:48] sscrollss: yea thats really annoying but just try working it out, bc as soon as someone tilts it‚Äôs hard to untilt, and if all else fails just mute or ignore them
[7:55:50] b3llamy: stunt does /mute all like every other game and this is in challenger
[7:55:56] Takionixes: how are the games going?
[7:56:32] Kiiyorin: @foltann you'll never survive this game that way. Need to be immune to ppl. Esp when doing supp or jung. Team might throw, you get blamed
[7:56:35] Kiiyorin: it is what it is
[7:57:23] foltann: @sscrollss yea like even if i understand smth ingame i cant make it work bc im tilted already
[7:57:38] foltann: @Kiiyorin it is what it is mute all every game from now on
[7:58:13] TrashSara: Yea, Dont take pings to personal. :)
[7:58:26] foltann: i cant...
[7:58:28] Kiiyorin: Early elo is learning the game and maining like 2-3 champs. Barely anything your teammates say help you
[7:58:33] Jesterium: fullmute all best thing to happen to league
[7:58:52] Kiiyorin: Remember... the ppl flaming you are the same elo as you

[7:59:28] Kiiyorin: panth ulted :D
[7:59:30] sscrollss: @foltann if you‚Äôre in like high plat low emerald the egos get pretty big there so that would make sense
[7:59:34] Kiiyorin: THE TILT!
[7:59:49] Apostolique: He's running it but he could kill you if you don't outplay Kreygasm
[7:59:51] foltann: like i main janna sup and im agressive with her same with lulu and when i have to go adc and they just stay behind me im going crazy
[7:59:52] HappyPuug: looks like my pant in plat

[8:30:43] Pirsigma: I mean, your tierlist is basically "dont play these bottom 3 champions and rest is fine" LUL
[8:31:14] dragonlilys: If they won EVERY game with Nilah her w/r would be higher KEKW
[8:31:18] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[8:31:19] som963: Best support with kaisa stunt?
[8:31:33] archimedes_9: best support IS kaisa
[8:31:35] Gahellz: I like Nilah but sometimes if you fall behind with a nilah adc it can be a miserable experience
[8:31:39] Cybychen: in my experience its more of a synergy between being agressive/passive at the same time than who I play to support them when I play with a Nilah.
[8:31:44] kncttv: yuumi in c tier? nowayyin
[8:31:50] som963: Learning

[8:32:17] som963: That champ should never have been made
[8:32:30] som963: What were they thinking when they made yuumi
[8:32:37] Pirsigma: I'd rather see a disco nunu than yuumi in bot lane ngl
[8:32:41] yonays: can we see a bard or shen game owo
[8:32:57] kncttv: yummi so good tbh maybe you just need to practice her a bit ..
[8:33:11] kncttv: it took me a while to get the hang of her ngl
[8:33:11] RiftJockel: they wanted to make a beginner friendly champion they said
[8:33:13] som963: No peepoAngry
[8:33:15] Cariyla: Nilah Rakan is so fun to play Gladge
[8:33:21] yonays: nooooooooo
[8:33:32] Cybychen: Its the same pyke adc, they just know xD
[8:33:33] RiftJockel: @soyeontv ofc she is but she is giga boring at the same time
[8:33:40] RiftJockel: who wants to play an item?
[8:33:44] kromeonn: yuumi with knights vow and Nilah op
[8:33:51] Gahellz: Cant go wrong with Nilah + Maokai right?
[8:34:05] BaneBladeV: it wasn't struggled!
[8:34:22] iStalkCheese: shouldn't you report people for leaking opggs in select

[8:36:50] BaneBladeV: Oldge
[8:36:53] b3llamy: literally does nothing LOL
[8:37:24] Havre__: I think it's hard to have some type of penalty issued from champ select tho
[8:37:31] Gahellz: you think riot is a gaming company but it's all just a big social experience
[8:37:33] BaneBladeV: they said soon about skarner 3 years ago
[8:37:34] kromeonn: I like copying and pasting the message of when I report someone into the hero select chat KEKHeim
