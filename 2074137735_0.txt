[0:33:28] the_acidrain: yeah i totally understand
[0:33:53] RickLUL: RTMP relays?
[0:33:55] RickLUL: what did i miss

[0:36:08] RickLUL: the_acidrain I wanted to make one, but bandwidth makes it a really risky bet
[0:36:16] the_acidrain: yeah i know man
[0:36:24] RickLUL: I can even get cheap bandwidth
[0:36:37] RickLUL: but without enough clients it wouldn't sustain itself engineering wise

[0:40:01] n03kill: @the_acidrain in gcp/aws you have bandwith limits, in aws available bandwidth depends on the amount of vcpus
[0:40:19] StrawberrySwirls: @the_acidrain the train meme guy
[0:40:28] sausagewithapples: does brunchmenus still come here?

[0:41:10] N3xUS3120: @StrawberrySwirls  AYOO
[0:41:32] the_acidrain: @n03kill 0.02c/GB - doesnt appear to be limited except for on the free plan
[0:41:33] StrawberrySwirls: @the_acidrain google him and click images lol

[0:43:20] teluoborg: hydra touched karma
[0:43:26] n03kill: @the_acidrain The available network bandwidth of an instance depends on the number of vCPUs that it has. For example, an m5.8xlarge instance has 32 vCPUs and 10 Gbps network .
[0:43:30] Fathai95: bro you press one button on briar and the champ plays itself
[0:44:01] the_acidrain: @n03kill not talking about throughput, talking about data limits :)

[0:45:50] brunchmenus: ALO
[0:45:58] gamasekas: what you type to mute/unmute?
[0:45:59] the_acidrain: @n03kill i dont see anywhere where i am limited to how much traffic i can send, i see how much until it's paid, but that's not an issue. a simple n1/n2 machine type or even custom machine type seems to have no bandwidth data cap, only throughput

[0:51:03] razertw1: frozen heart helps

[0:55:00] dripstud: team deathmatch over moba
[0:55:01] goodfellas323: WASSUP Feeder CowDaddy
[0:55:08] progopis: is the "we may have lost the game but look at all my kills" mentality
[0:55:10] Galkaria: simple minded people can't reflect enough that sometimes fighting without an objective is--- objectively bad
[0:55:14] bossofhalo: ahh h Philippines, they just love fighting for no reason.
[0:55:29] dripstud: win by ace is the only way
[0:55:34] razertw1: @m4dm4l1k I meant other hydra than titanic, was responding to the guy that said ravenous or profane better
[0:55:55] m4dm4l1k: @razertw1 ooh my bad sorry, the guy is stupid
[0:55:55] deserttactical97: wassup cowsepp good luck with games

[7:12:21] mickeyt67: @Cowsep did the thing you used to sell puts have sell short orders.?
[7:13:35] Jinmuu: Basically your app keeps a connection to the database, and when a change to the database happens it updates your components that are listening for changes. So you could design a chat without having to use Websockets just by listening to the DB entries.
