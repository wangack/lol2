[1:21:54] intingkarthus: at least jayce has counterplay
[1:22:02] alepsaisen: Also you get weak sided
[1:22:20] premofromhere: hey bro I'm here in Paris from nyc for fashion week are you coming
[1:22:21] cursedcomrade: I miss fervor of battle rune, top lane was sooo fun with old conqueror giving true dmg and fervor of battle
[1:22:38] narumie01: wat abt kayle top
[1:22:45] minatozakiLoL: and some people yap about saying that Aatrox q had as much range of range champ
[1:22:53] ilyaslifts: @frozenpi_ depends honestly but usually it's a spear of shojin angle , but again if u're against a hard armor champ like idk or or smtg u prefer going black clever or like zeryldas yk
[1:23:27] f4risca: its all drutut fault
[1:23:28] gauchinho7: how long have u been playing aatrox?
[1:23:37] Ramiesel: kayle?
[1:23:37] keyzerfiora: nerf range champion's ms pls riot
[1:23:44] AlchimistAN: aatrox is the king of melee
[1:23:45] 00_kleinmoretti: 10 years
[1:23:57] ilyaslifts: @frozenpi_ after that it depends on the opponents team comp , either edge of the night or u go tankier with spirit visage or like idk steraks
[1:24:18] BarrelMeTimbers: i just pick GP int 15 min and wait in a bush till they come close
[1:24:21] gauchinho7: If they ban aatrox do you think u still can perform challenger lvl?
[1:24:51] rivenevensucc: boo vayne top jumpscare
[1:25:07] Badmarch: It's not that ranged are op doe. Nasus/Malph exist, and god forbid Ornn lands ANYTHING on you. Its because top is such a garbage island that you cannot spare to pick something interactive and take any risks. If you lost lane then you get zoned for 12 minutes off of cs you are the reason you lost the game, and there's 0 counterplay outside of hoping that your team stomps or helps you out of the situation.
[1:25:18] Badmarch: Ty for coming to my tedtalk lolll
[1:25:22] armin0992: hang from a tree
[1:25:34] Sisyphus_lol: smolder

[1:26:05] アリオボーイ: Good morning around here boss o7
[1:26:17] AlchimistAN: is that potent on fiora ?
[1:26:21] Badmarch: @ilyaslifts If you fall behind 2 kills as ranged you can still get near cs with the range advantage. If you're 0/2 on Darius vs Gwen what you do xdd

[4:38:33] NIC_X99: holy
[4:38:35] filips322: Illaoi was broken a week ago... I would rather play against her rn
[4:38:43] gibcy: Make W grounded NotLikeThis
[4:38:44] hasan7v7: did he get buffed or smth?
[4:38:51] yahit0: 48% ban rate tf
[4:38:53] yahit0: LOL
[4:38:58] FrostlifeV: yet it's aatrox with the higher ban rate because people are dumb
[4:39:02] fortheempiree: riot decides to nerf AP tf instead of AD
[4:39:16] yassine5481: why ksate low WR he is destroying toplane
[4:39:20] filips322: It's just people don't know how to play against him so they ban him
[4:39:24] chrono_ward: They nerf his ap when he builds ap
[4:39:30] leaguesupportmain101: I missed when TF was never picked
[4:39:39] leaguesupportmain101: Now everyone is picking him because of his AD buffs
[4:39:45] chrono_ward: @chrono_ward meant his ad
[4:39:54] felippe_iv: phreak szn baby
[4:40:08] filips322: What should riot nerf so ranged top doesn't exist anymore?
[4:40:11] TheBestJhin44: helooo
[4:40:11] FrostlifeV: Aatrox will always have high pickrate because he's fun to play, so it will also have higher than usual banrate
[4:40:23] felippe_iv: WAIT TF TOP IS A THING NOW?
[4:40:26] felippe_iv: my god this game is trash
[4:40:29] felippe_iv: holy fucking shit
[4:40:34] noakin_: How is aatrox atm guys ?
[4:40:38] Paduloso: @filips322 fleet footjob
[4:40:38] leaguesupportmain101: @felippe_iv Yes
[4:40:46] leaguesupportmain101: Flash ghost TF top
[4:40:50] jaba_the_boar: how is olaf a bad pick vs aatrox ?
[4:40:50] filips322: @noakin_ shit
[4:40:56] felippe_iv: @leaguesupportmain101 nah man but how bad u gotta be at your job to make TF broken enough to be playable top lane
[4:41:05] felippe_iv: shit is insane
[4:41:09] nemya: Viewers 666
[4:41:13] leaguesupportmain101: @felippe_iv On god
[4:41:16] Nicholai_Deus: I feel more like Aatrox's high pick rate is because he's a more safe first pick champ
[4:41:19] filips322: Aatrox is bad because of the ranged matchups, not as a champion
[4:41:34] babytweet887: @filips322 ranged top will never really be removed because the existence of champs like Quinn and teemo means riot will never nerf an inherent feature that would make ranged unplayable toplane
[4:41:37] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[4:41:55] NIC_X99: @FrostlifeV if a champ has high pick rate in high elo means that is also strong, still he's a fun champ overall
[4:41:56] felippe_iv: any whos
[4:42:09] filips322: @babytweet887 here's the thing. Teemo and Quinn is more playable than Cassiopea and vayne

[4:43:44] Lord0aks: It happens to me aswell
[4:43:44] babytweet887: @filips322 if they removed grounded from w and put more into Cassio dps I think it would make the champ much healthier and remove the ability for her to be played anywhere but midlane🦅
[4:43:45] filips322: Same
[4:43:46] Aatrox696969: @Naayil Do i go Black Cleaver against Morde ?

[4:46:52] daaxusr: NAHHH
[4:46:56] filips322: He is in a hurry
[4:47:00] leaguesupportmain101: I feel like Camille support just looks for stuns with her E for picks, if she misses E, she is a sitting duck
[4:47:11] FrostlifeV: she needed to get 0.25s earlier
[4:47:32] Aatrox696969: Everyone's flashing lmao
[4:47:36] bytkier: btw why was camille support born? buffs or sum?
