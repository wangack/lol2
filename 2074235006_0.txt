[1:21:27] morbidnumbskull: AD Leblanc is waaaay weaker now
[1:21:30] moosE3knucklE: idk. i think they nerfed the shit out of AD leblanc
[1:21:58] morbidnumbskull: KKona Karthus Liberty
[1:22:03] moosE3knucklE: but now we have AD Twisted Fate. which i think is worse
[1:22:07] KiroTh3Hero: man I love your stream, wish you were streaming NA time :(
[1:22:26] orep__: Ayo karthus jungle? I tuned in at the right time xdd
[1:22:38] moosE3knucklE: Id rather have Ad Leblanc than this monstrosity of a champ Ad TF
[1:22:50] TheTrakker: 2 whole auto attacks? PridePog
[1:23:52] Albbasher: @Santorin Who is the best midlaner you ever played with on a team ?
[1:27:16] morbidnumbskull: Big bro is a mind reader KEKW
[1:27:31] morbidnumbskull: Mote is the worst 1st buy
[1:29:13] moosE3knucklE: you even warned him
[1:29:19] dicer1999: Welcome to jungle LUL
[1:29:37] shadow7master: sometimes u wonder if masters hv brain
[1:30:01] shadow7master: poor broxah is suffering in that elo hell
[1:30:05] moosE3knucklE: if he ults.. if u can wait to kill so he gets an assist is nice too
[1:30:44] NachoLazer_: It's detderT, his jng is goated
[1:31:43] SilexFPS: oh word, you like Beartooth?!
[1:31:46] CeremonD: dont u need exhaust in this matchup?
[1:31:54] NachoLazer_: danish jngler matchup
[1:32:18] morbidnumbskull: @shadow7master because he believes he's playing with humans
[1:32:21] moosE3knucklE: so true
[1:32:30] CeremonD: yeah makes sense
[1:33:14] shockking1: broxah is too caught on playing correctly
[1:33:31] shockking1: he needs to adapt to the chaos but instead he just gets angry at the clown nonsense
[1:33:35] puckad_: maglience LUL LUL LUL
[1:34:39] morbidnumbskull: @shockking1 He has certain 'expectations' from his teammates, sorta like a pro mentality
[1:34:53] moosE3knucklE: they go in on dumb stuff... but then do this...
[1:35:11] shadow7master: pain Despairge
[1:35:49] moosE3knucklE: keep in mind leblanc gave away an easy kill by trying to chain early and scaring the cho off when u tried to gank
[1:35:58] moosE3knucklE: but its a jungle gap lol
[1:37:37] moosE3knucklE: the one key thing about tanks... is even if u are losing. u can be useful by absorbing alot of damage for ur teammates lol
[1:38:02] everyman322: santorin wins these
[1:38:15] shockking1: more
[1:38:28] aln045: hellooo
[1:39:00] everyman322: time to build AD karthus YEP
[1:39:09] moosE3knucklE: people wonder why they lose... lol
[1:39:45] CeremonD: enemy doesnt build mr thou... yet
[1:40:13] moosE3knucklE: they have MR
[1:40:16] solidussovis: solidussovis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:40:20] moosE3knucklE: they have enough to matter
[1:40:28] kenvexz: exodia Zack stacking mr
[1:40:56] moosE3knucklE: Zack gets Rookern and he never dies
[1:41:02] CeremonD: chogath build frozen heart
[1:41:03] everyman322: meetings Pog heck yeah Kappa
[1:41:04] solidussovis: Lol actually took the day off to celebrate the anniversary
[1:41:16] moosE3knucklE: Cho gets rookern and he REALLY never dies lol
[1:41:26] Velraptured: So on the ww vod: I agree with you that ww's playstyle is kind of sus since it basically relies on enemy not playing properly.  But I feel like if they did something to help WW's clear, it would really make the champ have a lot more options. My idea is for his E to do a small amount of mgc dmg around him while he has it on, to encourage holding it and also help with clear+not make tiamat mandatory
[1:42:05] orep__: This game seems a little unplayable im not gonna lie
[1:42:31] everyman322: karma R+Q = back to base for you Sadge
[1:42:41] moosE3knucklE: Zac has Spirit visage and half way to Rookern. lol
[1:43:06] ThePeePuddle: Good day brother! Hope you had an amazing weekend! santorinLove
[1:43:15] everyman322: supportive mom is Pog not cringe ;)
[1:44:19] moosE3knucklE: Zac healed all the damage done to him with one W
[1:44:22] moosE3knucklE: this is over
[1:44:52] ThePeePuddle: go AP Karthus I don't get it Kappa
[1:44:56] everyman322: liandry's is a tank killing item right? 4Head
[1:44:56] ThePeePuddle: AD*
[1:44:57] kenvexz: Cho Zac ate that ult like it was a mf gogurt
[1:45:21] ThePeePuddle: oxygen is overrated
[1:45:34] moosE3knucklE: zac ate it like a snack and pressed W and healed back to full lol @kenvexz
[1:45:59] morbidnumbskull: Your teammates are a bunch of oxygen thieves... cull them!! KEKW
[1:46:24] moosE3knucklE: that cho is totally taking damage
[1:46:54] moosE3knucklE: it just took 5 ults and about 10 mins of attacking him. but he went down!
[1:47:24] coazii: The enemy turret can last till next game Holy shit lmao
[1:47:42] sl1ghtedk1ng: havent had a blue buff in ages... feels bad on karthus
[1:47:51] moosE3knucklE: wooo
[1:48:01] SlurpGod1: xdd

[1:48:47] SlurpGod1: close
[1:48:51] sl1ghtedk1ng: dont ff we win these
[1:48:59] moosE3knucklE: you first picked Karthus too...
[1:49:08] everyman322: I like tanks, but liandry's is pretty underpowered imo

[2:20:50] toxicgamesonly: Vi support is a thing low key

[2:21:38] iiNumb3rz: Ashe and rell are giga broken

[2:23:11] jzipfel20: Just remove the gold from hitting champs and keep it for executing minions.
[2:23:15] iiNumb3rz: Ends up the strongest champ in the game

[2:42:11] Social_Phobia: danish is similar to english? imo danish sounds like summoning every existing demon at once xD
[2:42:41] Praetor_GG: Germanic roots for both
[2:43:02] Social_Phobia: well i speak german ^^
[2:43:12] bierhell: How was your experience letting your parents know you wanted to be a Prof gamer instead of doing somthung conventional?
[2:43:21] B_Ryye: I don't have friends Sadge

[2:43:37] mindbo: det g√∏r du os i danmark m8 <3
[2:43:49] Danishshadow: @SilexFPS To bokm√•l (the most spoken version of norwegian) is extremely close to Danish, especially in writing
[2:43:51] mindbo: tysk er valgfri
[2:44:00] Ray701: that's why nordish metal is so popular
[2:44:05] puckad_: puckad_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:44:05] shadow7master: isnt danish like german?
[2:44:13] tullekuu: we can understand eachother
[2:44:14] puckad_: Subbing for Ornn jungle
[2:44:16] Danishshadow: Danish and Norwegian are far more similar
[2:44:18] morbidnumbskull: The basic functional conversation in Singapore uses a lot of borrowed english words
[2:44:23] Danishshadow: Especially bokm√•l
[2:44:27] milkweed_love: dutch is like german
[2:44:33] HalfmanDaan: Danish and Swedish is not that similar
[2:44:34] iiNumb3rz: How do you say lil bro in danish?
[2:44:42] Santorin: Lillebror
[2:44:45] Ray701: ornn jungle Despairge
[2:44:47] Danishshadow: @HalfmanDaan I mean they are
[2:44:56] everyman322: @Someone_44 true, it's mostly geographical reasons though. we're not super close to a bunch of countries that don't speak our native language like most of europe. and most americans don't travel to mexico
[2:45:08] prismaticalpr: do you always max w second on wukong?
[2:45:18] Ray701: i'm german and don't understand danish at all
[2:45:21] SilexFPS: @Danishshadow yeah i thought so, I was learning Norwegian and someone spoke Danish to me and I could still know what they were saying
[2:45:21] Social_Phobia: i have a few danish friends and i dont understand anything if they talk
[2:45:23] morbidnumbskull: Instead of saying welcome to the community, how bout "Welcome to the longship" @Santorin
[2:45:26] HalfmanDaan: @Danishshadow Nah, I've been customer support in both Swedish and Danish, Danish is not that similar
[2:45:29] JuviaFoxface: Trund uwu
[2:45:42] jzipfel20: Definitely an Ornn game
[2:45:48] puckad_: 100%
[2:45:49] Danishshadow: @HalfmanDaan The languages are mutually inteligible
[2:45:51] Rodacon: @everyman322 The UK has the same situation though. English being so universal at this point means people in the countries are less likely to need a second language.
[2:46:01] puckad_: YEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[2:46:06] Ray701: Despairge
[2:46:06] Reanimagus: KappaHD

[2:46:22] g1oomey: read orn lore before the game Kappa @Santorin
[2:46:31] g1oomey: it's  very important, probably
[2:46:34] Praetor_GG: the reality is there is little economic value in the average American learning something other than English, very different for non-English speakers
[2:46:41] milkweed_love: aftershock on long range engage is ???
[2:46:41] HalfmanDaan: I can however say, Norwegian and Danish is easy to have conversations with, Finnish however...

[3:51:11] Rodacon: I don't think anyone recommends long distance
[3:51:40] Pock3tsand: @Rodacon that's fair! but it helps to hear from people that made it work
[3:51:50] Rodacon: True
[3:52:10] NachoLazer_: Snail mail is no more LUL
[3:53:02] jzipfel20: hahaha Morde vs udyr haha

[4:23:14] nwa4lifeTV: if u dps teemo go inspiration
[4:23:14] Iamaf33d3r: Sub goal making people sub I see the tactics worked
[4:23:42] Sejstargazin: @PredatedDino oh man I miss mundo jungle from early 2021

[4:24:17] cjcunn506: surely the shrooms are good in the jungle right?
[4:24:37] nwa4lifeTV: i think tooth into rage into wits
[4:24:49] Mikytka: nashors -> liandries -> malignance!
[4:24:52] tugwos: Manco's is rageblade.  Bork or kraken.  Terminus
[4:24:53] Mikytka: shroom it up mate
[4:25:00] shadow7master: terminus+kraken get buff and mano using them
[4:25:07] Sejstargazin: @PredatedDino it used to be way easier before the rework tho
[4:26:21] Gabb049: I hate creep block :c
[4:26:43] nwa4lifeTV: this season his damage is very high
[4:26:57] PredatedDino: @Sejstargazin its better now he has one of the fastest clears in the game, if you do it right being able to clear all camps before your second smite comes up is pretty insane
[4:27:37] shadow7master: teemo terrorizing shaco xdd

[4:33:41] Ingenuitee8: Yes burn things
[4:33:43] nwa4lifeTV: u can get it later
[4:33:46] Iamaf33d3r: Deathcap is wild
[4:33:48] shadow7master: teemo can build anything
[4:33:58] TheSharmony: Malignance is still disgusting right?
[4:34:01] morbidnumbskull: Recurve bow does bonus magic dmg per hit
[4:34:40] Zeiik101: he leashed for you go back him up
[4:35:31] darkkkona: ooops
[4:36:13] Dezrunner: oh damn, teemo jungle

[4:36:57] Dezrunner: im good man... we're doing the more fringe picks now? =)
[4:37:19] Zady: Are we actually playing teemo jungle, am i actually seeing this correctly
[4:37:23] blast777: @BDubbb maybe he faked his own death to get away of that situation
[4:37:24] BDubbb: ah didnt know thats how that worked
[4:38:47] DeathWaffle: For attack speed Kappa
[4:38:50] DuckieFried: @Santorin bro whats a good jungler to one trick or a 2-3 pool to climb out of plat? currently play voli- brand-lily-briar
[4:42:05] TheTrakker: in the end it doesnt even matteeeeeeer
[4:42:50] morbidnumbskull: If you have good macro, you can increase win-rate for any champion
[4:43:15] DuckieFried: @Santorin thanks so much for the insight, never thought about it that way. Sorry to distract you from the game though, MB
[4:43:37] shadow7master: thresh should walk with u in jng and zeri stay and farm
[4:44:06] nwa4lifeTV: why yone no kraken
[4:44:19] Dacker___: With the Yone special?
[4:44:32] Dezrunner: Did we have a Trundle or Heca game yet?
[4:46:14] EdgedSilver: @Dezrunner yesterday for both I think
[4:46:27] shadow7master: gg
[4:46:40] morbidnumbskull: Yone mains are not welcome in Valhalla
[4:46:50] jzipfel20: Ornn is the better jgl pick over teemo I guess
[4:46:58] Mve_Ur_Bdy: Yone is the new Yassuo :(
[4:47:01] Sejstargazin: yone yasuo noc dead this patch
[4:47:33] EdgedSilver: Noct is fine you just have to play assassin or tanky now

[4:51:57] jzipfel20: Leona is super tanky fun right now
[4:52:03] DuckieFried: with the playmaker title lmao
[4:52:13] jesselgm: the worst is when a top/supp has last pick and does the opposite of countering their team
[4:52:18] EdgedSilver: tbf your team is a minefield for them to jump on you all with Janna disengage
[4:52:21] DuckieFried: yea lol
[4:52:26] jesselgm: fun games to watch
[4:53:15] stoicHolcan: never know how comfortable people are on melees tho, some people have no clue how to space or counter kiting as a melee
[4:54:56] Sejstargazin: whats wrong with this bullshit bot lane
[4:55:46] DeathWaffle: Guessing he's taking your blue?
[4:56:38] DeathWaffle: Your team hates you...

[4:57:09] Obeez: seems like playing around vayne this game is the only way
[4:57:16] blast777: smolder mid is literally a 2v3 for the laning phase.
[4:57:32] Sejstargazin: theres no god

[4:58:09] DuckieFried: @Santorin so this brings up a good question, when you have players like this do you just keep farming and make plays when you can or just avoid mid lane and do your own tempo and game
[4:58:36] DeathWaffle: Vayne knows whats up! Pog
[4:59:26] Sejstargazin: @DuckieFried hats a really good question

[5:33:48] TheGesterr: I'd watch her all day she's so gorgeous eavWow
[5:34:08] Doggers_: Don't really understand why they made all those changes to make new champs jungle then nerfed every single one
[5:34:26] Praetor_GG: @Doggers_ they realized they can't balance all that shit
[5:34:26] ntmadeit: do you think katarina players have the capability of understanding that
[5:34:50] TheGesterr: LMAO
[5:34:52] ntmadeit: MOGGED
[5:35:08] TheGesterr: THAT WAS SO BASED ACTUALLY WHAT YOU DID

[5:43:03] worldparadise420: Lmao
[5:43:21] jzipfel20: I think there is openings at the daycare for this top child?
[5:43:24] Praetor_GG: yone brain can strike at any time
[5:43:49] TheGesterr: @Santorin Cosmic Drive on AP Morgana goes hard when you ult you're a racecar
[5:44:07] FranckTRN: 5x Deathcap usually works for me on Morgana - but I play support :)
[5:44:17] jzipfel20: Well supports usually have to babysit and you did pick support jgl so they assumed you would babysit them
[5:44:47] hansel_lionheart: yone not ape
[5:44:52] worldparadise420: Your Zed is Faker replacement
[5:44:59] TheGesterr: I'm so excited for the new Planet of the Apes movie, crazy to see a teaser for it in Santorin's stream ü¶ç
[5:45:24] koushik_10: man i had a good laugh
[5:45:26] koushik_10: XD
[5:45:27] Praetor_GG: Hmm
[5:46:53] Doggers_: yeah some are closer to apes still than others
[5:47:18] TheGesterr: LOL TRUE
[5:48:00] DuckieFried: @TheGesterr the new ghostbusters looks even better imo lol
[5:48:55] worldparadise420: speaking of pro players, are u planning a watch along stream for this years worlds ?
[5:50:05] KerrKo: will you win?
[5:50:10] tugwos: Does Morg Q actually do anything to the dragon?
[5:50:19] TheGesterr: @tugwos does damage but no cc
[5:51:05] TheGesterr: you making me want to play Morgana jungle so bad
[5:51:37] Praetor_GG: morg does nothing YEP
[5:51:39] TheGesterr: GET COUNTERED LMAO
[5:51:49] irelia80t: yeah her Q is a shield breaker, it breaks the shield then applies stun, same as renekton
[5:52:01] TheGesterr: Rell Q and Renekton empowered W cracks sheilds first
[5:52:04] DJ_Photik: 2 part or same
[5:52:09] DJ_Photik: Oo
[5:52:12] FranckTRN: Wait, how come - does she do so much magic dmg to break it? I thought Rell doesn't break shields anymore by default.
[5:52:20] getsometalentloser: morgana really needs a revamp
[5:52:24] TheGesterr: @FranckTRN her Q breaks shields as an effect
[5:52:28] getsometalentloser: this champ is so dogshit bad
[5:52:45] Praetor_GG: you can prob carry on morg if you can somehow get 30 kills by 12 mins ok
[5:52:47] koushik_10: even thought he is playing tank jgl there is no excuse that he is 91 cs at 20 mins
[5:52:49] koushik_10: wtf
[5:52:53] irelia80t: @FranckTRN it's not about damage, it's effect of the spell, it breaks the shield first (cancel it), then it applies the stun effect
[5:53:10] getsometalentloser: @koushik_10 tank junglers espically rell
[5:53:14] getsometalentloser: are low econ
[5:53:36] TheGesterr: IMO Morgana should be a mid/jungle battle mage with her spellvamp and dps style, and a support last, kinda like a cc version of Swain
[5:53:38] Kraysys: there really is a winner's queue
[5:53:41] getsometalentloser: though in this case hes just gettingg apped
[5:53:55] getsometalentloser: @TheGesterr hehe she used to be a midlaner
[5:54:14] irelia80t: @getsometalentloser last time i played morg mid i got flamed because "she is a supp" LUL
[5:54:15] IamDreamShot: janna jungle WHEN
[5:54:24] FranckTRN: Well I knew she had en effect in the past but like yesterday someone was talking about Rell not breaking shields anymore so I got confused
[5:54:28] getsometalentloser: @irelia80t this waaaaaaaay back
[5:54:31] Praetor_GG: @irelia80t it's one of the worst picks
[5:54:33] koushik_10: sad
