[3:17:39] JoshuaAurelius: Watcha got against Will?
[3:17:41] d_elle1013: @zomatosoup I think so, but he based Jack on him in a way
[3:17:48] cluurrrrr: I only enjoy the first two movies and the rest just blend together
[3:17:54] cake223636: so we had to earn our hero title, but we’re just made pirates immediately? 😂

[3:31:38] Abbby: I haven't seen the movies in aaaages
[3:31:38] ElikAruna: there's seven pirates movies?!
[3:31:39] artemis172: i don't think so, i think they just brace for impact
[3:31:46] ushygushygooeywooey: theres only 3 in my world
[3:31:49] ushygushygooeywooey: the rest dont exist
[3:31:55] basicsciencetutor30: I also learned that too right now never knew either

[3:32:50] d_elle1013: hahahah
[3:33:04] TigerCub8312: I think i got it but I love im coming
[3:33:04] MatMcDonut: ok so there are 5 pirates movies
[3:33:13] MatMcDonut: I went through every script and ctrl f'd for 'hit the deck'
[3:33:14] cake223636: @ushygushygooeywooey Donald is saying “I got it” 😂
[3:33:17] MatMcDonut: they never say it ONCE
[3:33:20] MatMcDonut: this is HORSESHIT
[3:33:26] uhm_cat: mat lmaoooooo
[3:33:27] ushygushygooeywooey: hit the deck is too silly goofy
[3:33:30] cluurrrrr: mat doing the research haha

[3:34:00] cateybug11: @cake223636 hi cake!!
[3:34:00] Abbby: that is wild
[3:34:06] MatMcDonut: it feels like a star wars movie not having 'I've got a bad feeling about this'
[3:34:08] Abbby: how did they miss that opportunity
[3:34:10] MatMcDonut: how tf do they not say hit the deck???
[3:34:12] Emily4232: That's smart af
[3:34:15] SirCibble: mats so awesome and cool
[3:34:34] Arinleena: that neurodivergent info itch needs scratching
[3:34:42] ElikAruna: i looked it up. they only started using the phrase hit the deck like that in the 1920s. so it makes sense to not be in pirates
[3:35:08] MatMcDonut: ok so historical accuracy when it comes to phrases but we also get octopus men and zombies?????
[3:35:17] MatMcDonut: im in ur walls disney
[3:35:21] katiecafe: goofy’s fight noises trigger me
[3:35:35] ElikAruna: you gotta be historically accurate to make the zombies believable

[3:36:56] MatMcDonut: KEKW
[3:37:03] cake223636: I did not like that angle
[3:37:07] HyruleGirl9: The issue is that the scripts for these games were written by the japanese square enix writers who watched japanese versions of the disney movies...and then the game scripts were translated back into english for us, so it's like a disney reference telephone game
[3:37:16] ushygushygooeywooey: do you think they said no fair in the pirate films
[3:37:18] SirCibble: kh2 said we HAVE to be silly and goofy
[3:37:18] ushygushygooeywooey: NO FAIRRRRRRRRR
[3:37:19] uhm_cat: this is the part I mentioned when we were talking about pew pews a few streams ago, Will threatening to commit sewer slide but not holding the gun to his head lmaooooo @luxiegames

[3:38:00] Taaj_: howdyi4Hehe
[3:38:06] cake223636: @hyrulegirl9 but also there should’ve been localization on the English side of things
[3:38:28] Taaj_: Like he got grabbed by a character just then and flopped like he was in Toy Story
[3:38:35] Taaj_: just ragdoll behavior
[3:38:43] 8BitDylan: I just can't get over Square Enix sitting down and saying "let's make history and make a photo realistic (at the time) Pirates of the Carribean world"
[3:38:50] HyruleGirl9: @cake223636 Yeah, and it was kinda not the best is all I'm saying LUL I wish they hired people who knew their Disney so it wouldnt be so weird sometimes
[3:38:57] SirCibble: bro the save with the 1 munny lmao thats incredible i didnt even know that was possible
[3:39:02] TayFayMay: is there a Pirates disney ride?
[3:39:06] TheBennjack: "blow up the explosive barrel to stop it from exploding"

[3:39:45] cake223636: @hyrulegirl9 true true
[3:39:45] 8BitDylan: TBH I'm excited for them to make more movies outside of Jack Sparrow
[3:39:53] maytags: It's true
[3:39:55] zomatosoup: no its true
[3:39:55] mmmbop428: most of the movies with rides are rides first
[3:39:56] Taaj_: PotC is a Brother Bear prequel
[3:39:57] ElikAruna: i forget theres people who dont know that
[3:40:00] SirCibble: omg really????
[3:40:00] 8BitDylan: It is definitely true
[3:40:06] maytags: @SirCibble YES
[3:40:08] SirCibble: thats incredible
[3:40:10] mmmbop428: haunted mansion, potc all came first

[3:40:38] TayFayMay: haunted mansion is the same?? ride first?
[3:40:41] mmmbop428: a dole whip movie would slap
[3:40:42] keldabex: i admit i hyperfixated on the pirates movies i was OBSESSED
[3:40:43] darrenplaysbad: i remember when the first one came out people were like “a MOVIE based on a RIDE?!”
[3:40:43] SirCibble: TO BE FAIR i was ready for you to gaslight chat again
[3:40:45] cluurrrrr: they just tried with jungle cruise too
[3:40:46] Taaj_: The whole Tortuga scene in the first movie is almost verbatim what you see on the ride, it's like an homage
[3:40:46] mmmbop428: @tayfaymay yes!
[3:40:47] 8BitDylan: And then eventually that made an animatronic of Jack Sparrow for the ride even though he wasn't in the ride originally (to my knowledge)
[3:40:49] FreakingMoonMoon: Imagine if they did that for "Its a small world"
[3:40:53] sarahmaskill: I'd watch Orange Bird lore
[3:40:54] basicsciencetutor30: I thought it was well known that it was made after the ride
[3:41:02] 8BitDylan: I still need to watch the Jungle Cruise movie
[3:41:04] maytags: I liked the Jungle Cruise movie tooooooo
[3:41:05] keldabex: i liked it too!
[3:41:06] ElikAruna: jungle cruise was enjoyable

[3:42:45] maytags: They had a gun in KH1 too
[3:42:46] izzypls24: So for context, this is a data battle, where you go back and fight all of the members of Organization 13 but in data form, which is stronger than their original self.
[3:43:01] veryhairyheyyall: OH-
