[2:20:58] AmberAnjuna: hey KP, i hope the game is treating you better than yesterday <3
[2:21:07] Sammguy: jimbob_ywert: oof
[2:21:31] CynicalScrub: @KayPea have you considered trying karma mid at all yet?  it seems kinda busted with malignance
[2:21:38] AmberAnjuna: im in winning queue today, trying to get back into Emerald
[2:21:46] AmberAnjuna: lost like 15 games in a row went from E3 to P4
[2:21:47] mNardz: What game? that didnt even happen
[2:21:48] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: @Sammguy Stop watch is just part of seekers armguard now and transfers into shattered armguard when used :D
[2:22:02] jimbob_ywert: What lost game? you mean the game you went 42/7 on jinx with an inting team and lost? unfortunate one
[2:22:05] AllOfKingsPotato: FeelsStrongMan
[2:22:12] CynicalScrub: fair enough.  stop it with your paranoid logic, kelsie
[2:22:34] AmberAnjuna: New mmr is weird, they said it would be better but it most definitly is not hahaha

[2:23:20] CynicalScrub: it's like a clairvoyant moment.  you know the nerf is coming
[2:24:02] S17Master: I mean, they nerfed Radiant Virtue when Karma was abusing it too hard, Malignance is kinda the same, no?

[2:25:14] CynicalScrub: kaypea playlist better include songs like "la la laaaa" and "bum be bummm"
[2:25:15] jimbob_ywert: The main tilt in my games is my internet suddenly spiking and having 300 ping. happened today, disconnected, and lost LP with a penalty
[2:25:19] LittleChewrrie: what was the last song called????
[2:25:24] LittleChewrrie: @CynicalScrub YES

[2:37:51] lawfulevil_13: Maybe AD liss
[2:38:24] DiscordLuck: Malignance and Shadowflame
[2:38:31] CynicalScrub: i think rylai's first might not be awful against their comp
[2:38:35] DiscordLuck: That would be the best move against aurelion
[2:38:45] torsuff: I am okay, Day was really draining tho but I enjoy my feee time now
[2:38:57] FreeXe: It is
[2:39:25] FreeXe: Malignance is good on Lissandra. And you have a Gragas, might as well get it
[2:39:51] DiscordLuck: Malignance is actually pretty good due tothe item power that burns opponetns
[2:40:06] LittleChewrrie: Obsidian Chroma looks so nice on her <3
[2:40:17] CynicalScrub: ok gragas
[2:40:35] Sammguy: that sounds horrifying
[2:40:36] Ecak01: Why does that sound so dirty LUL
[2:40:55] Hamochakita: i dont like Malignance on liss i would rather full burst
[2:40:57] DiscordLuck: Malignance sounds so much better in spanish League: Maldad which translates to EVIL
[2:41:26] Sammguy: do it after this game
[2:41:33] Hamochakita: i get  lost chapter than go storm and shadow
[2:41:37] Hamochakita: dont finish the item
[2:41:38] CynicalScrub: i think rylai's would really set up ganks for darius
[2:41:40] s0beris: s0beris subscribed with Prime.

[2:43:07] Hamochakita: yeah i feel u i have been skipping the item alot  recently
[2:43:10] CynicalScrub: gragas going off
[2:43:39] Hamochakita: LOl
[2:43:48] via_trita: hard to find a non-toxic darius in general
[2:44:08] CynicalScrub: i feel like you guys are on a little bit of a timer to win this one
[2:44:13] Hamochakita: hes been strong for the past 2 years now
[2:44:16] CynicalScrub: can't let asol get too late into the game
[2:44:19] jzipfel20: It‚Äôs all in the belly bump!!

[2:52:36] DiscordLuck: I love when the herald goes out of pit and runs back to the area with some tippy tappies
[2:52:46] via_trita: darius positivity <3
[2:52:53] DiscordLuck: Shadowflame first
[2:53:00] mxclavicles: successful back gg winnable now
[2:53:03] jeffreye5: shadowflame blows people up when you e in and ult
[2:53:13] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea how is league treating you today?
[2:53:55] CynicalScrub: guys, what supports are good and fun this season?  i don't really like my xerath + lux for some reason
[2:54:00] Loksdead: i'm pretty sure banshee dfg and armort
[2:54:09] Loksdead: but ive nev er played dfg
[2:54:16] onespookynoodle: ive heard other streamers say shadowflame is a "bait" item, i dont know what that means tho lol
[2:54:26] DiscordLuck: @CynicalScrub Taric, Karma (REALLY FUN), Lux , Morgana, Renata and Milio
[2:54:58] dany_falcon: @KayPea senna's w prob
[2:55:00] via_trita: aww, poor grag from senna
[2:55:01] CynicalScrub: senna ults are really limiting your fun this game
[2:55:32] S17Master: @CynicalScrub Senna's existence limits fun for everyone
[2:55:39] mxclavicles: @cynicalscrub seraphine is still really good, I find Lulu still fun and apparently they just buffed her. but yeah karma is broken and so is senna
[2:55:54] CynicalScrub: @S17Master i like going against her as xerath cuz she's the squishiest champ in the game
[2:56:11] DiscordLuck: Karma in this season is *chefs kiss*
[2:56:15] mrry2k: olaf r has no reason to be thing long
[2:56:24] mrry2k: this *
[2:56:30] ObsceneSanity: shadowflame is massive? how is it bait
[2:56:39] GorillazNtheMyst: I think it's from landing axes, isn't it?
[2:56:45] aside_sue: it extends from his AA
[2:56:49] mxclavicles: is Olaf ult as long as tryndamere‚Äôs? they‚Äôre similar right?
[2:56:50] aside_sue: as long as he AAs his ult is up
[2:56:50] GorillazNtheMyst: idk, I don't play stinky champs like Olaf pinbFab
[2:56:53] CallofDaddy90: I think it extends as long as he is in attacking
[2:56:53] twinkywinkydpics: from atacks hahah
[2:56:59] jeffreye5: I‚Äôve always wondered about shadowflame on vayne becuase it crits true damage
[2:57:03] dany_falcon: @KayPea probably next part of morello and zhonya
[2:57:05] zzllaazz: as long as he is hitting something
[2:57:07] zzllaazz: it keeps going
[2:57:19] CynicalScrub: surprise!  3 in the bush again
[2:57:23] mrry2k: still quite unfair considering he becomes unstoppable and cant be cced
[2:57:24] padtime: Ragnarok's duration is increased by and up to 2.5 seconds for each basic attack On-hit icon on-hit or cast of Reckless Swing Reckless Swing against an enemy Champion icon champion.
[2:57:33] DiscordLuck: bush-monday really be pushing in }
[2:58:02] imscooterjon: reckless swing is his E, axe is Q
[2:58:13] aside_sue: basically his aas and his E
[2:58:16] dany_falcon: eternal ult
[2:58:18] dany_falcon: LUL
[2:58:19] khadapys: hi KayPea <3 hi Chat <3 have a nice day :D
[2:58:23] padtime: if left to free hit he is a monster lol

[2:59:06] xRoA: xRoA subscribed with Prime. 
[2:59:08] CynicalScrub: root, doesn't stun =/
[2:59:10] mane_infinit: Ashe destroying the plays
[2:59:13] dany_falcon: @KayPea LUL aimzSad
[2:59:45] CynicalScrub: senna is just ruining the fun
[2:59:50] MayaShieda: wait u call ur community the basement unironically? that's so  iconic lmao
[2:59:55] Ecak01: Even as a support main, I get so annoyed by my supports when I play mid
[2:59:57] DiscordLuck: I mean we all are picky with music tbh
[3:00:10] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea it's good to br picky about music, we don't want trash ü§£
[3:00:10] Darkcyter: Not pickier than me kaypAwkward
[3:00:13] Ecak01: I cannot tell you how many times a Janna ult screwed my lux ult over
[3:00:17] league_of_d3pression: No offense
[3:00:20] via_trita: thats the unfortunateness of soloq though, not every thinks of the same plays
[3:00:21] DiscordLuck: @Ecak01 OMG YES }
[3:00:29] adoniskou: use ulty on you @KayPea
[3:00:41] MayaShieda: if song request existed i'd prob request a plankton ai cover of one of your favourite songs
[3:00:43] lovecity: oh this chroma is so cool wtf
[3:00:56] DiscordLuck: That song sounds like I am still standing by Elton Jonh
[3:01:08] DiscordLuck: The rhythm
[3:01:18] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea you're music is always good, so I trust your pickiness
[3:01:21] CynicalScrub: lvl 15 olaf already, eek
[3:01:48] dany_falcon: vayne + a sol just got their late game .. sadge
[3:01:51] dany_falcon: press F
[3:02:20] tinycaptain304: I've gotten quite a few songs from your stream!! you do have good taste
[3:02:29] dany_falcon: yeah the most problem is olaf
[3:02:55] Ecak01: You played that really well though
[3:03:00] CynicalScrub: nobody can answer olaf, which is terrifying
[3:03:15] jeffreye5: Ashe support is so rarely useful lol
[3:03:25] via_trita: the olaf is making it impossible, everything else can be dealt with but that olaf...
[3:03:39] league_of_d3pression: It shouldn't be on you to handle Olaf, he is immune to your entire kit @kaypea
[3:03:47] CynicalScrub: ashe support is one of those supports that is good in lane and then kinda useless after
[3:04:15] CynicalScrub: yes, remove unstoppable mechanics!  so silly
[3:04:34] THE_ARKAYN: Just make him waste his ult
[3:04:35] CynicalScrub: i think you did, but not positive
[3:04:45] Ecak01: At least you didn't pick the snek eh
[3:05:01] league_of_d3pression: @cynicalscrub I think the concept of unstoppable is good, but it needs to have some drawbacks maybe longer cool downs to use it.
[3:05:22] CynicalScrub: GOT EM
[3:06:04] via_trita: passive
[3:06:10] DiscordLuck: brb, lunch itme
[3:06:19] LakyLG: darius got ignite ?
