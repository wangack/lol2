[2:37:01] Nanorox: some of these plays hold up but some just hurt my eyes
[2:37:24] duckygoesquaack: back then all of these players were just a random assortment of soloq players while today they have an army of analysts and researchers behind them
[2:38:15] Nanorox: and in NA they still can't find 5 dudes to zone drake entrances
[2:38:27] duckygoesquaack: yes they were good at the game I agree, im just saying if you compare it to todays standarts you cant even compare it anymore
[2:38:37] duckygoesquaack: today the SLIGHTEST missstep means death or game even
[2:39:16] duckygoesquaack: oh thats so tough
[2:39:20] Nanorox: There's a lot more comeback mechanics with shutdowns and objectives as well though

[2:42:15] Galkaria: S+ jungler?
[2:42:15] Nanorox: the bans are dumb dude. The worst part is that you're not bad at the other champs. It's just less fun for you
