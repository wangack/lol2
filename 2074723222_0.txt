[3:21:32] Suzakus: @PREFONTAlNE it's ok people have to start somewhere nodd just gotta think about what you're doing wrong to improve hehe
[3:21:33] Lionhardt544: @prefontalne But the flip side of that is that you have to make sure your lanes are healthy so they can go to dragon and/or time it for when your laners have pushed up
[3:21:41] Str0mcaller: i had a plat/gold game where i got flamed cause i didnt move/join a fight under their t2 bot min7~(every tower was up)

[3:22:43] ChromaKhroma: archi stunt3Star

[3:24:05] jungazouk: What a whore
[3:24:05] ChromaKhroma: Eww
[3:24:12] PREFONTAlNE: I mean yea. in the grand scheme of my life, league means absolutely nothing to me. even more so because I have a kid. but I love gaming and I’m competitive. so I only care about league when I play league. as soon as I log off I couldn’t care less. but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy the process of getting better. does that make sense?

[3:25:19] TannimWraith: fish
[3:25:22] PREFONTAlNE: true true
[3:25:42] PREFONTAlNE: the only thing that sucks is that Zac is kind ass right now as a jungler
[3:25:50] Suzakus: zac is decent I think
[3:25:52] horoo_: just play zac top
[3:25:55] horoo_: zac top is broken
[3:25:58] Suzakus: he's vulnerable to early invades but low elo doesn't do that often
[3:25:59] sealmunch: zac top babey
[3:26:01] archimedes_9: @averygoodally catKISS YouAreMyLittlePogChamp
[3:26:17] PREFONTAlNE: so I’ve had to expand my champ pool. and it’s been challenging. Zac has a 49% wr in jungle right now. but yea, he’s broken in top lane
[3:26:19] averygoodally: @archimedes_9 Hello SitsWithU smooch
[3:26:41] horoo_: PREFONTAlNE dont look at wr it doesnt matter unless champ is ultra dogshit or you are ultra highelo
[3:26:43] Suzakus: @PREFONTAlNE 49% is perfectly reasonable – honestly winrate doesn't matter if you play better (... to a degree. if something is like 40% wr it's probably pretty hard to win on lol)
[3:26:58] beeegus: uhm
[3:27:00] demonminer3: lol no
[3:27:00] Suzakus: like it's marginally better/worse but your own skill is usually more importan
[3:27:25] PREFONTAlNE: that makes sense. I will say though my last couple of sessions playing him have been less than ideal
[3:27:40] demonminer3: vex is a really strong counterpick tbh
[3:27:46] Suzakus: I think the general recommendation for your rank is to understand what your job is at what point in time
[3:27:49] La_Barbotte: @Quantum show smolder stacks plz
[3:27:59] PREFONTAlNE: that makes sense
[3:27:59] Suzakus: the easiest shortcut is probably to see what high elo junglers do
[3:28:00] ChromaKhroma: BIG fear
[3:28:00] Nightbot: 35712 BIG s in the chat
[3:28:11] Suzakus: but improve however you have fun, another way for self improvement is to try to review what went wrong and not make the same mistake
[3:28:13] BeLiddell: hi nick HEY
[3:28:17] Suzakus: but that's probably a bit slower uhh
[3:28:21] demonminer3: like, im not sure how good her blind is, but she is damn good when put against something with dashes imo
[3:28:23] Suzakus: the first is a important skill if you get really good though
[3:28:27] PREFONTAlNE: I’ve been learning Evelyn in norms. she’s super fun. but trash if you’re behind
[3:28:39] ChromaKhroma: moo oom
[3:28:51] averygoodally: MOOOM
[3:28:52] Furiusl: better voidcrabs or firt drake?
[3:28:52] Suzakus: @PREFONTAlNE also vulnerable to invades hehe
[3:29:02] Suzakus: power farm to 6, though once you hit 6 if you pick up a random kill or two you're still in the game
[3:29:22] sealmunch: me want 6 grubbies Mad
[3:29:29] PREFONTAlNE: and that has nothing to do with the fact that I think she’s sexy *cough* *cough*
[3:29:41] zonks___: Vex so mana hungry
[3:29:49] demonminer3: @PREFONTAlNE well, she is sexy. she's designed to be sexy
