[0:15:51] YourRequiredNameChange: Hiking tips:  Try going on a solo hike first and see if you enjoy the solitude.  If not, then find a friend or group to go with to determine if that's preferable

[0:19:05] theolliebb: @shag65 Yeah, I get it. Also people need to take into account.. studios have a lot of say of what the story will sadly have it in as well regardless of what the writer says.. Netflix may of just wanted something different or writers wanted something different, not sure. Just know too many variables /shrug.

[3:36:50] MannyAki: @Minimancer27 my kind of gamba
[3:36:54] blarggy: i reckon round 2 pick 3 is good enough. that means you're getting access to real good players
[3:37:10] blarggy: bears would have pick 1, pick like 9, and pick 32/34
[3:37:15] Vandheer2: I was positive this was KennyHoopla
[3:37:16] kncttv: @TheCoffeeCurator YEP

[3:37:53] TheCoffeeCurator: i just think streaming on multi platforms is so messy though and your chat is everywhere
[3:37:56] GodStanceUdyr: fields & 9 for pick 3 sounds good to me @blarggy
[3:38:01] MindStatic64: Yea Sadge
[3:38:02] aaaaashar: next
[3:38:13] MannyAki: nice
[3:38:14] blarggy: the rumors are jjettas is getting traded which might move them up to qb range
[3:38:20] restini: Hope the stream is going well mr. lourlo! chipichipichapachapa?
[3:38:28] blarggy: yeah that's not terrible but it means you get malik nabers instead of mhj probably
[3:38:36] MrFaby69: u heal of of them a lot also
[3:38:36] blarggy: or odunze or someone
[3:38:40] CainButcher: Lol
[3:38:44] MindStatic64: If they move jj I'm gonna be pissed
[3:38:45] imdimbel: Yes!
[3:38:46] NikideNiki: yes
[3:38:46] MrFaby69: thats why hydra is op af now

[3:38:50] pythonpleb: Yah you would
[3:38:50] SellionRB: yep
[3:38:51] Flavouur: its good, playing rn
[3:38:55] imdimbel: Epoch is better than PoE in my opinion
[3:38:55] hailtothechamp: Yes
[3:38:56] ChefTinyT: its better diablo
[3:38:57] glake2: its between d4 and poe
[3:38:57] bmaciswhack: i showed my friends the chipichipichapachapa song while we were in a normal draft game and everyone was losing their mind
[3:38:58] JilesDJae77: yup
[3:38:59] 54v463: @Lourlo You 100% will enjoy it, I can probably put you in relation for streamer drops etc too

[3:39:08] Vandheer2: oh shit I didn't know lourlo was a poe gamer
[3:39:09] blarggy: they might. the problem is they can either sign kirk and try to all in for a superbowl or they have to trade jj
[3:39:09] CuboneQ: fighting into triple wave and a lvl down and winning, gotta live renek
[3:39:12] DarthRaiser: idk, I was curious about it but heard servers weren't ready for launch so didnt get it
[3:39:12] grant4593: yep! it‚Äôs between the two in complexity. a lot of build variety. the game does minion builds incredibly well compared to d4/poe.
[3:39:15] BarrelOmonkies: Amazing game, more depth than D4 but not as much as PoE
[3:39:17] ofay07: POE good? Looks like you just spin around kill a mobs lol
[3:39:18] aaaaashar: Bing
[3:39:18] sebastianminiatures: More complex than Diablo, less complex than poe
[3:39:23] blarggy: you can't keep jj on a record-setting contract while you develop some rando qb
[3:39:24] pythonpleb: It's like in between, if Diablo is least deep game and poe is the hardest then this game is in middle
[3:39:30] blarggy: unless they try to steal baker mayfield maybe idk
[3:39:37] 54v463: 29.99
[3:39:39] CuboneQ: think it's like 30 isnt it?
[3:39:40] 54v463: iirc
[3:39:41] aaaaashar: it‚Äôs like 30
[3:39:47] grant4593: $35 on steam
[3:39:49] blarggy: not a lot of options other than trying to trade up and get a qb and start rebuilding now
[3:39:51] pythonpleb: I think it's 30 or 40
[3:39:55] MannyAki: lee is sprinting
[3:40:13] MindStatic64: Keep Kirko for another year and draft JJ and sit him for a year or something?
[3:40:16] aaaaashar: Noted got all that rambling
[3:40:19] CuboneQ: I would buy it for sure if I hadn't recently gone back to school so money is tight/non existant LuL

[3:42:02] CuboneQ: @Lourlo I need a stream to watch on my second monitor and none of my usual streamers are online. Could you endorse a stream for me to have on my second monitor?
[3:42:02] MindStatic64: xdd
[3:42:06] imdimbel: Yorick's buff were not okay, maiden deals way too much damage rn

[3:42:22] jbbyers: Goood, kill this yorick
[3:42:41] blarggy: but yeah idk, the rumor mill says there's talk of jjettas getting traded which only makes sense to me if they're not resigning kirk
[3:42:58] blarggy: could probably get a round one for him plus a player in return
[3:43:00] aaaaashar: YEP
