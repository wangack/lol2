[2:53:09] Amaresu_: thats the thing tho. its only for the sustain
[2:53:15] Amaresu_: the difference in dmg with profane is huge
[2:53:22] theredapple1: whats the chance you get rank 1 do you think?
[2:53:26] Amaresu_: but onceyou have all those other items its worth more having the sustain from ravenous
[2:53:28] exemptedspy: the healing is helpful, miss the healing when it’s not there
[2:53:32] meemi1337: You could play riven even AP and it's strong on ur hands haha
[2:53:52] SharpedIllusion: i think ravenous is just better overall
[2:53:53] Mingleberries: Been playing a ton of Vayne top because of watching you haha

[2:55:24] zanzaa321: like who tf beats riven as a champ if they're even all game
[2:55:35] SelenikLoL: that’s why I gotta be the one playing riven
[2:55:47] ImMajikYaKno: not annoying to play against? riven is like #1 most annoying champ all around
[2:56:02] theredapple1: not as annoying as say vayne if you have no mobility
[2:56:02] xfersRS: riven becomes much less annoying if you play her tho
[2:56:05] Amaresu_: if you have a 0 cc low dmg comp yeah she can ofc take over but any champ has the space where its good at rly.
[2:56:12] Amaresu_: and those comps rarely happen
[2:56:20] zanzaa321: teemo

[7:07:34] vicoixyz: the lvl up safed bard lol
[7:07:41] LaBirDy: is that cauz im too slow or too fast ?

[7:11:00] imibby_: @viper when are you adding darius to your champ pool
[7:11:03] vicoixyz: steelcaps and wait until they mess up
[7:11:06] LaBirDy: yeah, but the thing is to auto, ur using right click on him or ? cauz when i Q auto him Q auto him Q auto him i feel like i go "threw" him like i go forward .. when i see u kinda staying at the same spot sometimes. cant do that xD
