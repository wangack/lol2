[2:05:06] HeavensDarkEdg3: Any Vtuber
[2:05:06] Lanvira: !zwag
[2:05:06] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[2:05:07] solomons_ghost: zwag

Hi pekin genuine question: i have not played since the first days of the season, and i don't know what happened but in a month it looks like mages damage has become shit.

[5:16:57] BlueSNS: YesYes
[5:17:04] Sushiroll02: yup
[5:17:06] SootheOperator: I always hoped that was why
[5:17:10] Sushiroll02: !zwag
[5:17:10] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[5:17:15] Pxros: why does the viego have mastery on pbe xdddddddd
