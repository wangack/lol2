[2:57:11] SpankersQ: Drama 👀
[2:57:11] MaeIstromVo: @quantum your Diana traumatized me
[2:57:14] MaeIstromVo: :(
[2:57:21] SpankersQ: ...
[2:57:23] Quantum: uhh
[2:57:25] MaeIstromVo: streaming you can legit fake it way easier
[2:57:26] Quantum: LOL
[2:57:27] avuloseunda: @bladetrinity16 yesss i loved it but the nidhogg Aware
[2:57:33] xloveth: @MaeIstromVo dat part
[2:57:34] MaeIstromVo: you see social personas on every streamer
[2:57:37] Quantum: it depends on the 9-5
[2:57:40] bladetrinity16: @avuloseunda i felt bad killing her D:
[2:57:42] vegandiamond: twitter drama ResidentSleeper
[2:57:43] devenir11: lol Ive never streamed.
[2:57:47] Senyuno: Playing League is soulfully exhausting
[2:57:48] xloveth: yeah depends on what the 9-5 is
[2:57:50] MaeIstromVo: it has to be on the 9-5
[2:57:51] Con_IV: eh 9-5 is worse overall
[2:57:53] Tianxinn: customer servce eww
[2:57:54] SpankersQ: Tyler1 has been streaming for 16 hours surely that's more tough than a 9-5 @stunt
[2:57:57] avuloseunda: @bladetrinity16 :(
[2:58:06] xloveth: but i do think for bigger streamers it can be pretty socially exhausting
[2:58:09] devenir11: How does T1 stream for as long as he does lol
[2:58:11] jayinthi: 9-5 is way harder than streaming imo. Your day can either go good or bad.
[2:58:11] bladetrinity16: it was a fun af fight though
[2:58:14] Quantum: if anything
[2:58:18] xloveth: actually even as a smaller streamer u gotta work a lil hard too
[2:58:18] iuni__: i think if youve never/hardly ever worked a 9-5 job, you cannot speak on it
[2:58:19] Quantum: i think streaming lonely LOL
[2:58:20] Hendsa99: t1 hardest job in world
[2:58:25] Quantum: morie so than socially exhausting
[2:58:25] MissJenella: I just noticed the mango emoji in the stream title 🥭
[2:58:25] Jorndel: Depends on the job I guess. If you work in IT, you can sit watch YT/Twitch most of the time :D
[2:58:25] Nihilaette: i think it depends what you stream
[2:58:30] coconutcock: rember to the leauge comunity is a bunch of silly seagulls
[2:58:30] MaeIstromVo: streaming is like a niche type of job
[2:58:33] Tianxinn: @Quantum SadgeCry
[2:58:34] vegandiamond: OMEGALUL
[2:58:37] MissJenella: yea I think it's kinda lonely too nick
[2:58:38] MaeIstromVo: not everyone can do the social aspect of it

[2:58:40] jpressie: uuh
[2:58:42] tackyshotgun1: LUL
[2:58:43] Endz_Nz: rostered shifts more soul sucking than being able to stream when/how long need want

[2:58:46] casterminion7: lmaooooooooooo
[2:58:49] jpressie: pfft
[2:58:55] goose__bag: streaming as a job makes it exhausting. If you do it casually then probably less exhausting
[2:58:59] Senyuno: Parasocial
[2:58:59] Telperion16: There are some very easy 9-5s but no streamer would ever give up streaming for an easy 9-5
[2:59:00] avuloseunda: @bladetrinity16 i forgot what that was TT
[2:59:06] Quantum: i was a mechanic for liek 3-4 years
[2:59:10] r3nt0n7: Remember streaming can be super toxic too. Look at all the shit pink ward gets just for how he looks
[2:59:14] bladetrinity16: the tree squirrel
