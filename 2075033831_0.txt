[0:47:27] MrGuwee: @speedyuse6 is there a vod ? :D
[0:47:31] falvarrus: what a song <3
[0:47:34] speedyuse6: @MrGuwee not sure
[0:47:34] meleegod__: just played against a teemo last game ;(
[0:47:40] TrundleTop1: early is actually very nerfed but if u just play slow its fine imo @fishfishmagish harder to create leads early tho
[0:47:45] MrGuwee: @speedyuse6 exactly my point :))
[0:47:48] xDaveJaVu: smittysJam
[0:47:52] TrundleTop1: and u actually have to concede the lvl 1 push vs some champs now
[0:47:52] touchme1287: !aatrox
[0:47:52] Nightbot: just stay in ur wave so it pushes to u when he qs u. wait for them to use their passive on a minion. Dodge the sweetspots it worth cancelling an auto dodge. Once you get hull just push ignore him and hit tower.
[0:48:00] TrundleTop1: trundle could almost always get lvl 1 push but not anymore
[0:48:01] azzamandingo: love to see kata <3
