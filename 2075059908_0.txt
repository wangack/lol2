[0:34:52] jaggler: love how it took like 0,5 second for league players to start abusing the bait ping, though you could argue that the design itself was.... not smart
[0:35:31] crispytain: ludens + tear gotta be overkill right?
[0:35:48] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a ‚Ç¨500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.

[0:45:26] FoxyLuxana: amber new name?
[0:45:29] miftan: @Sjobbe oh yeah? how many guys have you had sex with?
[0:45:39] Alandus: I want to buy a handheld console/emulater or whatever you want to call it. It comes up with 10k oldschool games in it but I dont think you pay for the games so it feels like a piracy/theft? BUT if you wanted to buy the games, they are so old that in 99% of the cases you cant even buy them, because no one sells them
[0:45:41] Sjobbe: @FoxyLuxana different amber
[0:45:47] FoxyLuxana: oh

[0:46:29] gars0nnn: hi @MedicCasts
[0:46:39] crispytain: do u not fuck with piracy normally?
[0:46:42] tassadarapparently: Oh, you might want to think about a hitbox instead of a fightstick, they are the more popular option nowadays and easier to learn when you are used to keyboards.
[0:46:50] Big_Dannyy: NODDERS
[0:46:58] FoxyLuxana: autofill jgler nice
[0:47:14] Sjobbe: you wouldn't download a car
[0:47:21] jaggler: i pirated league of legends, AMA
[0:47:23] basketball39: I would
[0:47:25] Blaz1nrainbo: If the only way to play a game is through piracy i'm not taking money out of anyones hands.
[0:47:26] Big_Dannyy: roger roger, off we go to the high sees NODDERS
[0:47:26] Alandus: thanks xddLove
[0:47:55] jaggler: i wouldn'T download a car. maintanance, insurance, gas etc. it's just so expensive
[0:47:59] FoxyLuxana: whats this song? i cant see the title in the spotify window on screen
[0:48:10] miftan: Neil Gaiman has a very good take on piracy
[0:48:18] FoxyLuxana: thxxx
[0:48:30] jaggler: your boomer audience has bad eyes, spotify needs to be bigger Kappa
[0:49:17] jaggler: lobby chat already going strong
[0:49:58] Big_Dannyy: NODDERS
[0:50:04] miftan: yeah, i usually buy stuff after i know that i like it
[0:50:15] miftan: i don't go into stores and buy random books/games
[0:50:23] Big_Dannyy: its funny, the first game we made was on torrent sites in about 20 mins from release
[0:50:28] Ixdex1: when the chatting in lobby starts it's time to dodge like a butterfly
[0:50:31] Big_Dannyy: it has not
[0:50:45] Blaz1nrainbo: I currently have 100 hours in the backpack battles demo.
[0:51:10] The_Boeltato: Demos died because publishers discoverd calling them betas made them able to put out a worse product earlier, and sometimes profit off it
[0:51:18] jeriart: arent demos basically early access?
[0:51:19] LitoSheppard: its been rebranded as "open beta"
[0:51:21] jaggler: demos should be way bigger i feel like every year the steam next fest is a huge thing
[0:51:21] nuchelix: Steam has steam next fest for demos
[0:51:23] crispytain: if bethesda had demon starfield mightve sold half as many copies lmao
[0:51:41] jaggler: remember demo discs for PlayStation etc.? Good old times
[0:51:42] Big_Dannyy: demos are wierd, you get a lot of demos for games that have a couple of hours of gameplay (< 10) but big games with hundreds of hours dont
[0:52:14] jaggler: demo is like "here try this completed game" Beta is "hey, tell us, what you think about it, what should we change".
[0:52:29] Big_Dannyy: demo disks that were full of malware KEKW Kappa
[0:52:34] jaggler: Of course some publishers use beta as just marketing KEKW
[0:52:42] remixlol1: GeyGuys
[0:52:50] remixlol1: Hey*
[0:52:51] remixlol1: Damn
[0:52:51] Blaz1nrainbo: Or from a magazine. I remember standing lookout for folks to steal the demo disks out of the magazines at the pharmacy.
[0:53:00] Sjobbe: GeyGuys
[0:53:09] Big_Dannyy: uhm, a lot of balancing, that would make the game feel a lot different
[0:53:13] Big_Dannyy: in a good or a bad way
[0:53:44] remixlol1: NewWorld
[0:53:53] Big_Dannyy: most game devs develop systems with the intent of them being tweakable
[0:53:53] Sjobbe: Well no, but you can get a bit of head start on it
[0:54:10] Big_Dannyy: so a week of balancing can make the game playable
[0:54:18] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[0:54:19] jaggler: Thinking about WoW, a beta lasts a few months. You can't change the base, but there a many thing that could be changed
[0:54:24] BARDINETTE: 175 raiders from BARDINETTE have joined! 
[0:54:25] StreamElements: BARDINETTE just raided the channel with 175 viewers PogChamp
[0:54:29] Big_Dannyy: or it can make the game unplayable LUL

[1:58:46] TATOzchaty: is thresh in meta again maybe?
[1:59:56] TATOzchaty: researches for shows or castings?
[2:01:26] itstotallyamber: The LEC have their own stats team to do general research, casters mostly wanna keep up with meta/builds/items etc etc with the odd 'fun fact'
[2:02:27] sabh326: do you get banned for posting links im not sure, and dont want to get banned lmao
[2:02:47] itstotallyamber: Yeah no links

[2:07:34] 0kkom: I forget, but didn't you play baldur's gate on stream sometime? Was that with LEC talent or do I misremember
[2:07:36] sabh326: does anyone know what elo this is?

[2:08:12] LoLRankBot: Medic is Diamond I 21 LP  | Altaccount is Platinum II 36 LP
[2:08:33] jaggler: naaah, reset, don't push advantages Kappa
[2:08:34] itstotallyamber: @0kkom He did play some BG3 with 'the bois'
[2:08:44] 0kkom: I remember not watching then to avoid spoilers for myself but now that I'm on my like 6th playthrough I think I'd be fine to watch the vods if they're available somewhere
[2:08:47] itstotallyamber: Those were times
[2:08:56] 0kkom: @itstotallyamber Ok, thanks!
[2:09:06] DrakosCasts: Very much collapsed
[2:09:11] DrakosCasts: All momentum gone
[2:09:16] itstotallyamber: Everyone is spreading democracy now
[2:09:42] itstotallyamber: Until the next new shiny thing
[2:09:47] Sjobbe: and in a couple of week the farms will rise again
[2:09:54] jaggler: you know what they say about democracy. It's very spreadable as long as you don't keep it in the fridge at too low temperatures
[2:10:17] 0kkom: I'd watch the heck out of medic's baldur's gate playthrough, solo or multiplayer
[2:10:31] itstotallyamber: They added a new patch with more smoochies how can you not wanna play
[2:10:50] eaglewing: for story I actually recommend solo. For wild fiesta def with friends :D
[2:10:51] 0kkom: I've played a few playthroughs both solo and with friends, I feel like it's a different game solo vs with a full group
[2:10:51] jaggler: didn't play BG3 until now, i feel like an outcast Sadge
[2:11:05] itstotallyamber: I mean if someone can shapeshift into one...
[2:11:19] itstotallyamber: Who knows
[2:11:20] judgeozz: do you build pathtracer every game?
[2:11:31] itstotallyamber: Larian do love to cover almost all bases XD
[2:11:32] judgeozz: uh yeah
[2:11:36] CLEEman: You think with the eclipse Kaisa build being meta, then lethality xayah might be good again ?
[2:11:39] DrakosCasts: @jaggler Just avoid spoilers and enjoy. Its best singleplayer anyway
[2:11:42] jaggler: tracepather
[2:11:53] remixlol1: @jaggler trailblazer
[2:12:07] itstotallyamber: Yeah a lot of people suggest single player first just to get a feel for it before going in the deep end with a crew
[2:12:07] 0kkom: I feel like bg3 is really good singleplayer but I have friends who aren
[2:12:10] imKennart: Kaisa is way more fun with crit anyway
[2:12:12] 0kkom: whoops
[2:12:20] sabh326: @DrakosCasts I was really high at a club in Krakow and spent 3 hours convinced this guy I was talking to was you lmao
[2:12:21] Ixdex1: my current bg3 run is stuck because of a quest breaking bug Sadge waiting on a hotfix hopefully
[2:12:27] 0kkom: aren't into story games as much but love the multiplayer combat-focused shenanigans
[2:12:30] judgeozz: they don't do walk faster anymore, no?
[2:12:33] Tobbbyyyyy: didnt they remove the quicker walk? @MedicCasts
[2:12:39] jaggler: @DrakosCasts ty mr. Drakos. i avoided spoilers until now so i am hoping i can keep it up. but there are too many good game to play right now
[2:12:45] remixlol1: They dont walk quicker with Nash buff. @mediccasts
[2:12:46] jaggler: atm i'm loving the persona 3 remake
[2:13:02] CLEEman: yea ive been playing with it in 250 lp masters, be it seems to be pretty good with ingenios hunter. then eclipse and  opportunity.
[2:13:08] remixlol1: If you speed up urself while they are nash buffed then they go faster
[2:13:08] Tobbbyyyyy: looong ago :D
[2:13:09] 0kkom: @Ixdex1 which bug is that? There's a console mod you can install that I used to break my honour mode run out of a game breaking combat bug
[2:13:11] judgeozz: like last season
[2:13:13] remixlol1: Lets say u ult, then they are faster
[2:14:02] Ixdex1: @0kkom it's something that's cropped up with lat patch apparently, so no console way to advance it apparently. Can't complete the defeat the goblins quest because i knocked out minthara
[2:14:35] 0kkom: @Ixdex1 oh darn, that blows t3kFeels
[2:14:48] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[2:14:53] Ixdex1: it does :p well reported bug tho, so hopefully next hotfix will fix it
[2:15:14] itstotallyamber: Just running an ad sorry non badge havers
[2:15:16] Ixdex1: either that or restart a 14 hours run because i'm a dumb dumb with no saves
[2:16:18] itstotallyamber: LPL is so goofy sometimes
[2:16:21] itstotallyamber: I love it
[2:16:25] Sjobbe: medicChair
[2:16:39] 0kkom: @Ixdex1 My friend group and I lost a 50h honour mode run due to what we're 99& sure is a bug but it was so incredibly funny that we couldn't even be mad
[2:16:39] itstotallyamber: Shoutout to the LPL English crew
[2:16:42] DrakosCasts: Vedi got the day off today so they just gave it to me too.
[2:16:52] itstotallyamber: Poggggg
[2:16:59] 0kkom: Honour mode is SO FUN. IT'S SO FUNNN
[2:17:04] Ixdex1: @0kkom oh that's a sad one. Which one was it?

[2:17:17] imKennart: helldivershelldivershelldivershelldivershelldivershelldivershelldivers
[2:17:18] Ixdex1: also i'm never playing honor mode in my life, that sounds miserable LUL
[2:17:24] itstotallyamber: Does the chall run for like three weeks or smth
[2:17:30] habs1292: habs1292 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:17:35] itstotallyamber: Oh one okay
[2:17:46] DrakosCasts: Honor mode seems like a bit much tbh for your first solo playthrough
[2:17:54] DrakosCasts: story is not important at all past what it gives you
[2:17:58] 0kkom: @Ixdex1 I'll dm it (as soon as I remember where twitch DM's are) to spare chat of the spoilers
[2:18:06] Ixdex1: fair ok
[2:18:11] DrakosCasts: I feel like you just have to degen min-max or get ruined lmao
[2:18:17] Sjobbe: content-run
[2:18:44] imKennart: ezreal angle
[2:18:48] Ixdex1: it's actually kind of the opposite? You can't really min-max because evryone needs some survivability or they die like flies
[2:19:08] habs1292: i just made it back to honor lvl 3 after being 2 week banned a while back Pog
[2:19:17] Ixdex1: poor casters get oneshotted by spit
[2:19:29] habs1292: who knew mute all could be so helpful
[2:19:53] itstotallyamber: muteall is defo the angle
[2:20:06] imKennart: Even better you can disable chat
[2:20:32] imKennart: That way even if you wanna type some shit, you can't
[2:20:36] imKennart: Yep goated
[2:20:47] habs1292: omg i never knew that, thanks
[2:21:16] Ixdex1: as a jungle main muteall was basically the only way i could play league at all
[2:21:29] townofbird: is flat hp common? i just assumed scaling hp was taken on all champs
[2:21:48] 0kkom: A bit late to this convo, but I feel like honour mode and minmaxxing with it doesn't take away from the story, just makes leveling and combat more difficult to go along with the story
[2:22:18] townofbird: flat hp diff Pog
[2:22:19] MaxFiction: outplayed
[2:22:23] Ixdex1: did they buff thresh or something? I thought he was kinda garbage tier rn

[2:32:56] itstotallyamber: SeemsGood
[2:34:55] iCuriosity: If mastermind isnt interesting enough for the song request, how about some Bling-Bang-Bang-Born
[2:34:57] viaFunk: yeah i just meant you might win 2v2 cus ashe gets those lvl stats
[2:35:48] StreamElements: Any more tier 3 gifters in chat?
