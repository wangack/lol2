[5:28:43] howmanysoj: bent over row and seated pull row
[5:28:55] jwiggy27: @howmanysoj these for sure
[5:28:57] trollercoaster113: without proper form you are going to engage your shoulders and just end up with shoulder pain... there is no real easy way to just do lats
[5:29:05] Almadovar: For sure, you'll even train your flex a little bit doesn't matter if you bend your knees with bent over row
[5:29:07] deserttactical97: yeah bendover rows but your lower back will hurt
[5:29:10] Almadovar: but the resistance band pull on one knee is the best imo
[5:29:13] deserttactical97: you have to get used to it
[5:29:16] PFI_Animus: you guys are giving him bicep movements. slow negative pull-ups. trust
[5:29:17] Chrisssan: im a compettive swimmer. it helps you build lats and triceps naturally. very good to shape a v cut
[5:29:23] deserttactical97: bendover rows are perfect for back
[5:29:25] exaccord: little bit shoulders on diops
[5:29:25] 510Sportiva: @concubeou I agree with this guy. single arm lay pull-down.
[5:29:38] StyxR: get straps for pulldowns
[5:29:57] deserttactical97: yeah dips also make front delt
[5:29:57] Almadovar: start surfing, i'm a surfer I can't train chest properly because of overdeveloped lats haha
[5:29:59] csguerreiro: you can do barbell rows instead of dumbell rows
[5:30:15] StyxR: @almadovar how does that work
[5:30:36] Almadovar: @StyxR I meant benching, I can't figure out the bench bc my lats instant take over
[5:30:48] howmanysoj: you need someone to show you, you probably do a lot of things incorrectly
[5:30:52] Chrisssan: swimming is amazing for shaping your body and toning shoulder/arm
[5:30:53] exaccord: Less talky more jungy
[5:30:53] StyxR: no i mean how does surfing build lats
[5:31:08] yungcyclo: pull overs
[5:31:16] Almadovar: @StyxR for real? It's the main muscle you use for paddling
[5:31:21] dadims: climbing is always leg first
[5:31:24] Chrisssan: swim like 3000 yards a day, you'll see a huge difference in 2-3 weeks
[5:31:29] teluoborg: climbing is about coordination
[5:31:32] exaccord: swimming in general for upper back
[5:31:34] yoowansumfudge: paddling
[5:31:39] StyxR: @almadovar well idk i dont surf
[5:31:43] StyxR: just asking
[5:31:45] howmanysoj: get a personal trainer that can show you. dont be cheap on this
[5:31:47] dadims: a climber with good fundamentals focuses on their legs more
[5:31:53] csguerreiro: @Chrisssan doing butterfly xdd
[5:31:54] Almadovar: @StyxR oh sorry no problem bro hahah! I thought it was a doubting question haha
[5:32:05] deserttactical97: why does he live in korea? hows life there
[5:32:06] exaccord: I started doing triathalons and noticed my shoulders/upper back get destroyed training swimming
[5:32:19] Chrisssan: @exaccord that's if you swim like a noob. i did compettive swimming and you can grow chest with breast and fly
[5:32:35] Almadovar: yeah but the problem for me is to enjoy swimming you need a very good form which I don't have
[5:32:38] CantyBloke: twitch chat will be your personal trainer :)
[5:32:42] StyxR: do bodyweight bar rows
[5:32:42] howmanysoj: are you serious?
[5:32:47] Chrisssan: and you can work on your legs with breast kick. i was able to  start squat at 185lbs first try cuz of my kicks
[5:32:49] exaccord: @Chrisssan I 100% swim like a noob. Only training is watching YT videos. Never swam in my life
[5:32:50] PFI_Animus: if you're more of a gym bro like me, slow negative pull ups. you'll see lat results in a couple weeks
[5:33:13] exaccord: @Chrisssan Im also only doing free, with very little legs, need legs for bike/run
[5:33:14] CantyBloke: id recommend just buying a mower and pushing it for 9 hours a day, everything works itself out KKonaW
[5:33:24] Almadovar: Cowsep buy yourself a set of resistance bands, look up "resistance band lats" trust me you'll feel them I train almost all the time with resistance bands and it gives an insane pump
[5:33:26] Chrisssan: @exaccord get a coach, it's worth it. you don't know your own technique if you dont know what you're doing wrong
[5:33:30] StyxR: personal trainers are a waste of money unless you are a professional athlete or extremely unfit tbh
[5:33:33] howmanysoj: I f'ed my lower back because I 'winged' it
[5:33:46] King_Sack_: damn the croc got u
[5:33:56] exaccord: @Chrisssan Ive been kicking that around. I really need to. Done that for running and it helped a ton
[5:33:58] StyxR: get an experienced gym bro
[5:33:59] snmglblack10: that renek wnats ur booty

[5:34:07] Almadovar: yeah not like that
[5:34:10] exaccord: @Chrisssan And swimming is much more complicated
[5:34:44] Chrisssan: swimming is a hyper technical sport. there are actually great breakdowns of michael phelps freestyle and breast stroke techniques from all angles on youtube
[5:34:49] 510Sportiva: just subscribe to renaissance periodization from Dr. Mike. that’ll handle everything for you.
[5:34:53] Almadovar: you put it onto a bar or whatever, sit on one knee take the resistance in the hand from the knee that's on the ground resting, bend over fully stretch then pull with your lats behind your back
[5:34:55] Almadovar: they'll burn
[5:35:38] Almadovar: it looks like you're proposing, reaching for something far away at shoulder height and pulling it behind your back
[5:35:42] exaccord: @Chrisssan Its incredibly technical, which is why Im enjoying it so much. Ran for years, got real bored, the Tri has me fully engaged again
[5:36:12] StyxR: trenything is possible
[5:36:13] WaterEater1: darius same lvl as botlane ICANT
[5:36:18] Chrisssan: MISTER YA activated
[5:36:33] Driveup: with titanic randuis tabi you are unkillable
[5:36:41] Almadovar: not down
[5:36:43] PsychicBLAZ3: @Almadovar This is the way.
[5:36:45] StyxR: we need a cowsep workout vlog
[5:36:51] Chrisssan: with runan patch, im sure you're gonna go runan second item right?
[5:37:06] CantyBloke: film exercise with resistance bands incase an accident happens, they are great youtube content :)
[5:37:16] csguerreiro: single arm lat pulldown or smth
[5:38:00] Almadovar: look up single arm banded row
[5:38:11] Almadovar: and you should find the one i'm mentioning
[5:38:13] mohzar: i really do suggest lat prayers or straight arm pullovers.  that's the only way i've been able to really feel my lats activate
[5:38:19] WaterEater1: darius ICANT
[5:38:20] yoowansumfudge: single arm hog cranker
[5:38:23] Driveup: darius dont like auto-ing people i guess
[5:38:23] Almadovar: I've had professional trainers from O'neill when I surfed for them and that was my go to exercise for lats
[5:38:25] StyxR: train your forearms
[5:38:35] Almadovar: I even think LeanX has a vid about it
[5:38:43] Almadovar: or AthleanX sorry
[5:39:01] HakunaMatataaah: Master Lee
[5:39:09] xFabeOne: is sound out of sync or is it just me ?
[5:39:16] Almadovar: It's the best for me because you train at the biggest range of motion possible for lats
[5:39:17] SliggyLoL: crazy how sylas is just walking at you during highlander
[5:39:48] howmanysoj: youtube this:

[5:48:28] StyxR: @xtriddle soul knight or soul fighter
[5:48:37] StyxR: soul fighter was the league event
[5:49:39] Blam____: when pulling back try to make ur shoulderblades touch

[5:51:03] Kennyl4d: Cowsep do you reccomend Magicraft?
[5:51:06] Kennyl4d: is this game addicting?
[5:51:17] Kennyl4d: or will you forget about it like you did soulstone survivors?
[5:52:41] StyxR: shoulderblades are for upper back
[5:53:21] howmanysoj: when it come to lats, they sometimes say your elbows come together

[5:54:02] howmanysoj: that's because your lats insert into your armpits
[5:54:13] SliggyLoL: not all bodies are magical
[5:55:39] dirtyinter666: @Cowsep  TIA+BORK OR KRAK+ RB? WHICH IS MORE CONSISTENT

[6:04:40] Kennyl4d: !korea
[6:04:40] StreamElements: Cowsep moved to Korea in September 2012 originally to become a game developer. He secured a job as a teacher fresh out of university to get his foot on the ground, failed to get any jobs as a game developer, and transitioned into a full time streamer and stayed there because he likes how the cities are set up, and how comfortable and easy it is to live there. Hes been streaming since 2014 full time.
[6:04:52] shuai96: I learned how to play YI from you back in like season 5

[6:06:27] Kennyl4d: did you have a plan B?

[6:07:44] ckodsa: what did u teach
[6:07:49] shuai96: Oh yea, did you teach in Korea?
[6:08:00] Kennyl4d: That's funny. You would have to deal with little Kennies and teach them english
[6:08:09] Kennyl4d: Ironic isn't it?
[6:08:11] xcEnigma: Will you move to programming full time in the next 5-10yrs?
[6:08:17] ckodsa: oh no, not the kennys
[6:08:22] Chisnich: You think a masters degree holder could teach in korea fairly easily?
[6:08:45] Kennyl4d: That's funny. You would have to deal with little Kennies and teach them english. Ironic isn't it?
[6:08:51] Kennyl4d: then you would be forced to answer questions!
[6:09:25] ckodsa: nah, he'd call them idiots and not read the comments D:
[6:09:46] shuai96: Lol who can give a cowsep biography
[6:09:50] Haggozag: @Kennyl4d this guy thinks his comment is so important that he posts it back to back twice
[6:10:04] Kennyl4d: @haggozag BAN
[6:10:32] Chisnich: Interesting. Thank you. I just got my masters and I'm not sure what to do next, teaching in korea sounds kinda fun I guess
[6:10:51] Kennyl4d: Did you also say "NEXT" when one of your pupils struggled to learn?
[6:10:55] shuai96: Japan might be cool to teach at too
