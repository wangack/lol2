[3:04:17] fragileweeb: experimented a bit in practice tool, deathcap is barely better than sorc shoes even at higher mr, and shojin is much better than death cap (almost 25% more damage). shadowflame magic pen (even without crits) was also much better
[3:04:18] luis0g01: @solarbacca Why is it better to put the skills in that form of casting instead of putting them in quick casting?

[3:08:02] phaantu: DAMN
[3:08:04] SirSvenson: how would the difference be if they had some MR though
[3:08:14] ihopeyourehappynow: yeah shadowflame w low hp targets always goated tho
[3:08:18] SirSvenson: wouldn't sorcs be a little more comparable
[3:08:32] Rabb1tChamp: he is perma applying horizon @solarbacca
[3:08:34] fragileweeb: shojin is also really comparable to horizon focus btw
[3:08:37] llinley_: 1000 more damage that's crazy
[3:08:38] entergehenna: is riftmaker also viable

[3:10:14] entergehenna: shojin earlier?
[3:10:16] bleachd23: maybe I was cooking LMAO
[3:10:20] Rabb1tChamp: spear looks like a clear 5th item too @solarbacca
[3:10:21] fragileweeb: shojin and horizon focus give you almost the same damage btw, at basically any point in the build
[3:10:22] KroutonzOfficial: COCKA
[3:10:23] phaantu: why is shojin better than shadow flame??
[3:10:23] Nightbot: cuz
