[0:57:43] SirkaTTV: idk what to do now, like what do i do with my hands if league is broke?
[0:57:54] guerepanda: I guess it'd be an interesting test
[0:57:59] ltachy: pull ur chicken @sirkattv

[1:00:46] ch3m15try: are they nerfing karma in 14.5?
[1:00:48] Mastro323: maybe cause you can burn while shes stealthed?
[1:00:54] ltachy: why are karma and senna both in melee range lmao
[1:01:04] Mastro323: idk
[1:01:06] guerepanda: was assuming it helps understanding where akali is during stealth
[1:01:17] kezzidan: GIGACHAD sneaky
[1:01:19] shortseller77: He went liabdries because you don‚Äôt get full wfffect of speed with akali hiding in shroud

[4:00:15] robot_pirates: shotgun is a lot of dps, but you have to face the enemy, so you should turn towards the boss when you use it
[4:00:29] Theraxisz: @BendixBoy you never get as strong as you do in VS so you actually have to care a little bit, and the mining and secondary gathering objectives do add a lot to it
[4:00:47] TobyDuck: HUH
[4:00:48] OzLid: HUH
[4:00:49] mcegginton: HUH
[4:01:05] Theraxisz: they knew what they were doing when they voiced it like that

[6:35:47] bossthelevel: Got out of the game where I swear the enemy kale, my team smolder had it out for each other. They wouldn't even team fight, they would just run two lane like some kind of high noon dualist b*******, the kale would always kill the smolder, the smolders passive would always kill the kale.
[6:35:47] AirTotten: looked like an epic statue

[6:36:15] octovine: @HHexic yknow who is a clown though? YOU gg
[6:36:19] everyman322: @AirTotten they can see by the fact that he's past level 6 and never shown a trail or used his ult, unless they think he used it out of vision somewhere?
[6:36:19] VonleapoldIII: According to the video you win any second now
[6:36:29] HHexic: @ltachy Tell that to @KoojTxib
[6:36:36] KoojTxib: Nerdge x2
[6:36:38] bossthelevel: Like it was actually like clockwork they would just show up to the same Lane, the kale would kill the smolder first, but smolder passive op
[6:36:49] bossthelevel: And then at that point it was legitimately I was playing league as a 4v4
[6:36:54] AirTotten: @everyman322 lol....if you don't see it you'll never know where or if he used it. It's a tactic clearly.

[8:24:03] andyman8888: 40% slow
[8:24:23] meDOGCHAMP: there's a bug with frozen heart causing it to apply the 20% recursivley and im just making it up i actually dont know
[8:24:29] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: 5Head because it makes 20% of every attack 20% slower, not just 20%.
[8:24:34] LeagueofLoveTV: what if fh is lowering the ratio nickiThink
[8:24:35] the_tozo: @meDOGCHAMP BASED Chatting
[8:24:39] GenzzTV: mf said RECURSIVELY

[8:27:58] NFIZZLER: lees on some powder
[8:28:03] SeanZeroLoL: @GenzzTV I think riftmaker is solid on azir, so you dont need to perma W to proc lich, but W when they run out of it or need to reposition soldier. Lich might be too good tho to not build, just a though
