[4:38:11] madmatt2233: Morde has been solid this season
[4:38:13] Choemeye: the best moment I had is when I first did a playthrough killing the grove, and I saw the dialogue option to tell Zevlor , "at least you will be dead when they(goblins) reach the children"
[4:38:40] marbletabletop: dang yo, that's cold blooded
[4:38:40] madmatt2233: Most of the time you don't take tp on morde lately

[4:40:48] Choemeye: its so tragic when Zevlor first finds out our betrayal
[4:41:12] TheUnfairLife: he does have biscuits Kappa
[4:41:47] derpstevenson: Yeah you gotta be evil as shit to destroy the grove, but you gotta do it if you want Minthara. I couldn't stick with my evil play through though because I just can't stay motivated to do heinous stuff.
[4:41:47] MushroomXYZ0: Just gonna say, I am enjoying your content for years now. Started watching when I was studying. Now I have a Family and still watching your streams whenever I can. Kepp going! Greetings from Germany
[4:43:10] Choemeye: another cool part of the game is that certain scenes play out differently depending on circumstances, like when you meet the monster hunter in Auntie Ethel's bog. If you already know about Astarion's vampirism, you have the option of fighting him or not, but if you don't know already, Astarion just stabs him in the face with a knife before he reveals it lol
