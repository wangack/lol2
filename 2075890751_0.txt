[2:11:32] antroz92: i think it takes time for the report to go in
[2:11:33] Pitju99: that's almost certainly not real dom he doesnt play lee sin
[2:12:14] Sarnyroth: @ipav999 isn't Cloth Armor not very worth it bc most of Fiora dmg is true damage? Or do you start it bc you want the extra potions?
[2:13:14] Sarnyroth: Oh I see.
[2:13:18] knowndepth: she isnt always hitting vitals
[2:14:58] Tokenshii: hola ipavv
[2:18:25] Pitju99: probably
[2:18:53] loanshark18: na sus
[2:19:14] Pitju99: Fleet is nice when you don't know the matchup, it's the safe option
[2:22:39] Pitju99: ignite to counter alcohol
[2:23:29] Pitju99: isn't he supposed to have comet?

[2:25:30] loanshark18: it’s a clown fiesta
[2:25:47] Pitju99: oh 4 kill sena bot will surely do great this game Clueless

[2:29:23] zookeeperpatrik: !elo
[2:31:51] Pitju99: I hate gragas lane
[2:32:04] Pitju99: maybe second wind is also necessary
[2:33:14] Pitju99: wouldn't orb be good in this lane?
[2:34:07] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[2:34:55] Pitju99: we are still losing in dragons.. somehow
[2:36:47] Tokenshii: jg and supp diff
[2:39:15] Pitju99: I don't know if swifties is that good into gragas without PTA
[2:39:41] Pitju99: I thought it was for running through Q to all in
[2:39:49] Pitju99: but maybe mercs better with fleet
[2:41:45] Pitju99: for this lane specifically
[2:41:47] Pitju99: idk
[2:43:54] Tokenshii: I think the offensive strategy runes would have been useful against gragas
[2:45:35] Tokenshii: jg diff
[2:45:38] Pitju99: not much to do, I don't know if any setup can survive gragas lee if you get ultes
[2:47:03] justname: KEKL
[2:47:10] Pitju99: this game was doomed from lvl 1 let's be real here, 4 kill senna start should be illegal
[2:47:19] henrymichell2: @justname catKISS
[2:47:27] Tokenshii: The reality is that they abandoned you at the top and at the bottom they did nothing to take advantage
[2:47:34] justname: @henrymichell2 MYAAA
[2:47:39] Sarnyroth: Roough games today
[2:48:11] Pitju99: kill distribution matters though
[2:48:35] Tokenshii: jg diff
[2:48:39] Pitju99: rengar sussy indeed
[2:49:59] Pitju99: it started really well and then greed
[2:50:25] Tokenshii: that rengar ruined the game, it wasn't your fault ipav
[2:50:57] Pitju99: ???
[2:51:19] Pitju99: nevermind lvl 2 was where he lost lol
[2:52:01] Sarnyroth: "Rengar is not norma" KEKW
[2:52:17] Pitju99: is this a rookern game?
[2:52:23] Sarnyroth: D:

[2:53:45] Pitju99: funny purple item of doom
[2:54:59] Tokenshii: good luck
[2:56:26] yukishiro44: this malphite is about committing warcrimes
[2:59:42] Sarnyroth: Well, could be worse
[2:59:46] Sarnyroth: Good roam from Ahri
[3:00:25] Tokenshii: DinoDance
[3:00:28] Pitju99: just when it's perfect rookern game, the adc is 3-0 Madge
[3:04:49] Pitju99: why did xayah start that item
[3:09:24] Pitju99: xayah started 4-0, bought a terrible item
[3:09:35] Pitju99: and went 4 4
[3:09:43] paladin109: he plays around the tank KEKL
[3:09:56] Pitju99: but also diana insanely bad
[3:10:31] botstonedlulu: ipavJAM
[3:14:47] Pitju99: rookern
[3:15:40] Pitju99: I mean realistically game is over but only vlad could hurt you
[3:16:50] Pitju99: did they change lord dominiks  or why did xayah rush that
[3:17:01] Pitju99: isn't that an absolute waste of gold early
[3:20:26] Tokenshii: ggs ipav
[3:20:41] Pitju99: first item
[3:20:45] Pitju99: she got it first
[3:20:49] Pitju99: so bad

[3:24:25] Pitju99: Searched up teemo counters LUL
[3:25:03] Tokenshii: good luck ipav
[3:25:05] Pitju99: I heard volibear is quite OP now
[3:25:12] Pitju99: with the right build
[3:25:48] Pitju99: they figured out a build for him
[3:26:49] Sarnyroth: the xD just reassures that he's tilted from that
[3:28:33] yukishiro44: lmfao
[3:28:39] Benny32: that olaf is crazy LUL
[3:29:53] Pitju99: he has alternator minute 4 probably not unhappy
[3:30:37] Tokenshii: I'm sorry for making you angry a while ago ipav, I didn't mean to bother.

[3:36:14] Sarnyroth: I like having grubs on Teemo bc it makes me feel as if my E can actually affect turrets Sadge
[3:37:51] Pitju99: as much as I would like it it wouldn't make sense
[3:38:15] antroz92: voli kekw

[3:41:32] Sarnyroth: I haven't played League in at least 2 months now, I just like watching iPav bully people with Teemo YEP
[3:41:59] Pitju99: ipavSip
[3:42:00] ApplePieEUW: I came for the teemo and stayed for the boobies Kappa
[3:42:03] hcd737: hola ipav, como estas? :)
[3:43:02] Pitju99: ult cooldown must be really good
[3:43:10] Sarnyroth: Everfrost guaranteed that her charm would hit. And if her charm hit, you were dead YEP
[3:43:14] Pitju99: and lich bane procs off her ults
[3:43:28] Pitju99: now you have to dodge the autos and ulti much better Kappa
[3:43:34] Pitju99: and W
[3:43:42] Pitju99: this is much worse imo
[3:45:33] Pitju99: sounds good to me she has all the frontline
[3:47:25] Sarnyroth: Yknow Sylas W used to do execute dmg if they were low hp, when he first came out. Now with Shadowflame changed, he has it again, I just realized.
[3:49:07] Pitju99: he actually got a lot of gold from splitting
[3:49:49] Sarnyroth: Bye Ahri
[3:50:21] ApplePieEUW: Gg
[3:50:33] Pitju99: when he picked olaf last second this was bound to happen
[3:51:11] Pitju99: yeah LOL

[4:00:32] Pitju99: support items are insanely op though
[4:00:53] Pitju99: I've seen double support items more than double dorans
[4:03:46] Sarnyroth: Double support item got fixed im psure, I remember them saying they'd take it out
[4:04:19] VoodooChild420: muy bien gato
[4:04:24] Pitju99: they always say that though
[4:04:48] Pitju99: supp items always become a problem and it takes like 4 fixes to kill it every season
[4:05:01] CrusherStrife: nice pussy / Buena gatito
[4:05:22] Sarnyroth: No I mean like I'm psure it's already dead. Unless I missed the memo and its still meta.

[4:34:37] Suicidallangel: good rune
[4:34:57] Tagurse: Cut down is so much better if you dont go hp runes
[4:35:13] Pitju99: all numbers were high though cause 63k dmg
[4:35:31] Tagurse: I mean cut down as a rune does so much more if you didn't have to go hp runes *
[4:35:42] Tagurse: I prefer tanky teemo aswell
[4:36:26] razer_mon: u should go TANKMO and lichbane too
[4:36:29] Tagurse: Cut down has just better numbers, especially against a few tanks/bruisers
[4:36:29] razer_mon: STONK em
[4:36:29] Pitju99: I mean if he keeps playing into tahm kench sure
[4:36:55] Pitju99: you can still go cutdown with HP runes if you really have to
[4:36:59] Tagurse: But with HP runes you cant play it really and Coup de Grace is better for sure
[4:37:16] Tagurse: Yeah against Sion or ornn sure
[4:37:19] Pitju99: if you play against tahm cho sion it will proc anyways
[4:37:56] Tagurse: Idk against tahm I just cant play the game

[4:43:34] Tagurse: Yes W is dash/stun
[4:44:21] stickymcbeans: good shrooms
[4:44:22] Pitju99: spit him into the shroom KEKW
[4:45:28] Tagurse: That's what I mean, squishy against tanky. Cut down is op
[4:45:55] Pitju99: it's really strong early-mid but missing all that hp hurts later on
[4:46:45] Pitju99: I think he just wants to block the first CC ability
[4:48:01] razer_mon: awwwww
[4:48:07] razer_mon: idkkk
[4:48:29] Tagurse: GIGACHAD gameplay
[4:49:07] Tagurse: But people will be "man my top is only 1/2/5"
[4:49:16] Xiphlo: ahYes
[4:50:42] Pitju99: yeah I think that's flawed logic
[4:51:04] JC75_: the tanks will be buying their own HP items which have way more HP than AP items
[4:51:05] Pitju99: giving up on a good item to buff a rune slightly
[4:52:02] Pitju99: items have priority over rune efficiency
[4:52:11] Pitju99: runes support items and not the other way around
[4:52:41] Pitju99: it could do 2k damage and extra 4k from liandry
[4:52:42] JC75_: liandry will def be more damage than the couple extra % of cut down dmg
[4:53:05] Pitju99: items just have higher impact than runes
[4:54:00] Varelico: Liandrys into tahm as well
[4:54:05] Pitju99: cut down is good but you dont have to build for it
[4:54:11] Tagurse: I dont think senna has more hp than senna unless she picks 2 hp items
[4:55:07] Lazynameross: RabbitArrive
[4:55:30] Tagurse: Yeah especially because I am not that good as ty g and cant dodge it all
[4:55:38] Tagurse: I get hit by tahm and then dead
[4:55:49] Pitju99: thats what I mean
[4:56:00] Pitju99: cut down is good on its own you can build health with it
[4:56:22] matheusgusmao00: I miss your face cam
[4:58:16] Tagurse: Waiting for tankmo Arc
[4:58:56] Tagurse: Bb gn
