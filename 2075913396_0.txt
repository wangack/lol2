[4:00:34] shy_katie_kat: Hiii as a person brand new to top lane, and trying to learn matchups as riven is there any advice you could give to help me learn without feeding the enemy top every game? I try to fight when I have similar items to strength test but I almost always lose :(
[4:01:00] secondsaygee: uhhh
[4:01:12] fizzlemewhizzle3: is he on na?
[4:01:41] secondsaygee: @shy_katie_kat On Riven you don't fight when you have similar items. You just fight as much as you can up until level 6.
[4:02:15] SaintBlarney: @fizzlemewhizzle3 unlikely. His NA ping is ~60
[4:02:18] secondsaygee: unless you're in a bad matchup of course.
[4:03:02] shy_katie_kat: @secondsaygee yeah thats my problem is i dont know matchups so i just keep trying to fight when im similar strength to see how i compare
