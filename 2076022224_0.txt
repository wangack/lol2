[0:27:16] sbreed_1: did they nerf it?
[0:27:19] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[0:27:22] chocco_icecream: all thread abilities are nerfed
[0:27:27] EXxnightingale: we basically have 3 spells now xd
[0:27:49] argusang: W is very good on low elos where people run straight
[0:27:57] alex99mk: you remember old aatrox w?
[0:27:58] gl0o0ry: not even the ult tbh
[0:28:02] korok0: and W cooldown is ridiculously high
[0:28:10] shibayami: Why w garbage?
[0:28:12] chocco_icecream: the only thread that isnt nerfed to the ground is fiddle W in lane cuz it gives him mana back if someone walks away
[0:28:37] IsoMSS: re-add his old w make him auto attack champ again Kappa
[0:28:40] pomorato1: If they make it like garen e it would be cool so he heals on champions hit while ulting
[0:28:43] LegendaaryFusions: that would be even worse because they can easily walk out
[0:28:49] gl0o0ry: RIOT NOTTED
[0:29:18] chocco_icecream: w team
[0:29:20] LegendaaryFusions: my best idea is to reduce the time it takes for the pull to happen by 0.1
[0:29:35] grandeto: it woud be to OP
[0:29:39] grandeto: i think
[0:29:44] unknownpykemain: too op
[0:29:45] khaan1002: still can walk out with ghost
[0:29:50] sejeniklascool: that sounds like a good trade
[0:29:51] Arhil120: cant they just move out easily then? @Naayil
[0:29:51] sbreed_1: so it wont pull or still pull?
[0:29:52] pobrilo4ko: tower gold?
[0:29:58] Ffion99: maybe silence instead
[0:29:58] LegendaaryFusions: in teamfights that would be really strong for a catch
[0:29:59] mrWhateverItwas: it would be perfect
[0:30:03] LegendaaryFusions: in laning it would be useless
[0:30:04] argusang: a buff on the W means Q and E will get nerfed
[0:30:05] shibayami: Aatrox for now is perfect
[0:30:09] Jonoth1: it kinda makes sense that you couldnt dash since your being chained, I can see it
[0:30:09] baelraa: i think some characters get boots and just walk forward to get out
[0:30:12] Dzzyy_: you cant walk out when there is a aatrox qing your ass
[0:30:13] baelraa: makes the spell pointless
[0:30:15] IsoMSS: it would be really disgusting in jg skirmishes later in the game
[0:30:20] korkijeb2: then Darius press ghost and beat atrox
[0:30:21] EXxnightingale: increase range of W???
[0:30:22] pomorato1: I think it should be a entirely new ability
[0:30:22] omg69959: @Naayil make it like poppy w I guess atleast make it flashable
[0:30:26] chocco_icecream: maybe they become marked if they leave it so they  cant engage again of they take extra damage?
[0:30:30] LegendaaryFusions: you can still walk out of it though
[0:30:38] Dzzyy_: what do you mean in my elo
[0:30:46] Dzzyy_: second q is way to big
[0:30:49] Ffion99: silence so they can walk out but not flash or dash out

[0:31:34] unknownpykemain: a lot
[0:31:45] lolzitenx: if its grounded without a slow effect they would walk out really easily, maybe add grounded and nerf the slow effect

[0:32:19] LegendaaryFusions: your suggestion will make it so people can walk out of it without ghost
[0:32:24] tw0cutz: wait, what is the nerf on the W?
[0:32:27] chocco_icecream: what about they make the slow better?
[0:32:27] omg69959: @Naayil make aatrox w like poppy w make it so its flashable atleast but undashable
[0:32:28] safeseggs: basically he saying u cant walk ut of q cos ur ass
[0:32:31] sbreed_1: what nerf did it get again
[0:32:39] teamGalacticGrunt: yeah but sadly there are more people in low elo than high one
[0:32:49] hscoolx: Syrlda doesn't help?
[0:32:51] niba0706: @EXxnightingale bro garen basically has like heca ms
[0:32:55] pobrilo4ko: Make it so that W doesn't have to hit like Mordekaiser's ult, so that you can throw it over creeps.
[0:32:55] geokomo20: btw aatrox guide for ss14 still coming right ?
[0:32:55] pomorato1: Honestly make it like trundle e
[0:32:58] chocco_icecream: @tw0cutz they "fixed" threads so now the second u walk out it cancels

[0:33:57] 2scorcht: high elo is all about 1v9 champs
[0:34:00] sbreed_1: so the w cant pull after the flash out last second like it used to?
[0:34:00] niba0706: @EXxnightingale do u not see how fast he gets when he presses q bro
[0:34:04] Ffion99: @niba0706 its like u didnt listen to a word he said

[1:41:09] shltfart69: Based Zac
[1:41:10] le_jackalz: 3 lvls down a support solo kills toplane XD

[1:42:29] theksubi: thats in theme too
[1:42:39] weaseIl: W empowers next auto to slow like darius W
[1:42:45] chocco_icecream: w as gore drinked active would be good on aartrox but nerfed ofc
[1:42:52] dweber62: is serpents fang good into eclipse users?
[1:43:17] kasztelan92_: @naayil and now compare aatrox W with Zoe’s sleep for instance xd she didn’t even need to hit it
[1:43:48] shltfart69: Make the w slow scale with ad

[1:45:40] seifhesham36669: dosent aatrox good against ranged champs
[1:45:49] kralzo: LUL u hit her with 2 Qs she was slowed and still got out of the W
[1:46:09] dweber62: @seifhesham36669 i dont think its as much about ranged champs and more about jayce lol

[1:47:00] z3urnwi: teemo
[1:47:03] shltfart69: I feel like a good fix for Aatrox w is making the slow scale with ad, or increase the slow per level like nasus w

[2:02:39] 3lvis22: isnt that like for every champ?
[2:02:53] z3urnwi: @slotzz__ check some videos, yone should be good against rumble
[2:02:57] vankata1234f: @Naayil do u think kayn/viego will be enough to exit dimong ?

[2:03:08] 1DavyJones_: why do i feel offended now? xd
[2:03:14] slotzz__: @z3urnwi trying to get out of silver is gonna give me cancer on god
[2:03:19] estoyenunmontage: @vankata1234f add an ap champ (eve , nida , brand most op right now) and you´re fine
[2:03:20] StrawberryBursts: you mean at the highest levels champions weaknesses show up, but at the same time, it's basically all melee tops, they just aren't that strong actually
[2:03:37] vlone098: cuck
[2:03:48] grandeto: Gragas is hard vs Aatrox in every elo..
[2:03:54] z3urnwi: @slotzz__ well matchup videos help a lot gl
[2:03:57] Gearski: me when i try to interact with aatrox:
[2:04:03] slotzz__: i can go 5/0 5/1 whatever in top lane and every other lane starts to throw
[2:04:03] 3lvis22: how do you decide between lethality and bruiser?
[2:04:30] parox3tine: @z3urnwi you must be iron if u think yone is good against rumble lmfao
[2:04:35] ShuIkin: i play in master and ur 100% right
[2:04:39] GambiGun: Sippin
[2:04:47] z3urnwi: @parox3tine in lower elo its good
[2:04:48] StrawberryBursts: the issue is that even dedicated anti range top laners lose vs these ranged, isn't it? @Naayil
[2:04:52] neilhymantft: I know what u mean
[2:04:54] vankata1234f: @Naayil  do u think i can exit dimond with viego and kayn ????
[2:04:56] 1DavyJones_: @3lvis22 pro play => Lethality, SoloQ => Bruiser
[2:04:57] grandeto: Im not totaly agree with you mate..
[2:05:01] StrawberryBursts: so they can blind pick them
[2:05:07] vuckooooo1: U are right my guy

[2:05:19] neilhymantft: @naayil how many girlfriends do you have?
[2:05:26] grandeto: That what you said is pretty much for every champ.
[2:05:58] Gearski: it applies to riven
[2:06:02] StrawberryBursts: every champion has this issue tbh
[2:06:02] Gearski: in reverse

[2:07:06] dabsus: why are they nerfing her ):
[2:07:18] geeko_keego: They actually changed the Evelynn nerf to Q AP ratio going down
[2:07:20] meedmax99: how many got u to climb challenger first time
[2:07:21] grandeto: Its like every fightrer, if you manage to win hard your lane, you are broken, If dont you are just useless, isn't it?
[2:07:32] sunset789: u think any aatrox build will use that one tempest item (the one that make u hit multiple people at once?)
[2:07:41] 3lvis22: diana mid no?
[2:07:45] PawelloG: @Naayil what is worse, vayne or master yi top?
[2:07:52] sunset789: its getting changed from range only to any champ
[2:07:53] dabsus: riot is always going for my champs bro i feel targeted
[2:08:10] StrawberryBursts: I don't think anything is worse than vayne top KEKW
[2:08:13] 3lvis22: its a counter kekw

[2:09:53] 3lvis22: mobility is op in league
[2:10:01] 3lvis22: thats why everybody goes ghost
[2:10:06] aviranx: voli after the buffs is real good tho even if he loses lane as long as farms good
[2:10:14] azeerlol: hey naayil :D
[2:10:19] 熊汶安齋拉拉水水: @neilhymantft OMEGALUL
[2:10:33] StrawberryBursts: oh right, passive nerfs on vayne are huge tho
[2:10:41] tabasco250ml: mobility is better cuz u can use its as agro and defensive
[2:10:41] StrawberryBursts: iirc irelia losing 5ms cost her like 3% wr
[2:10:52] certified_lifesaver: but aatrox dash is unpredictable and low cd max lvl, no? isnt he mobile?

[2:11:29] thugpooh: the smallest dash KEKW
[2:11:33] 3lvis22: he is pretty immobile compared to most champs
[2:11:39] vankata1234f: isnt atrox dash on a 20 sec cd
[2:11:56] certified_lifesaver: sorry for being brainded naayil
[2:12:11] parox3tine: having 500 ms with swifties and passive was just vile
[2:12:23] thugpooh: FeelsStrongMan i remember when aatrox had 2 dashes in his E
[2:12:25] parox3tine: doesn’t matter if u have a 2 second dash u ain’t running that down
[2:12:29] naaffyynaw: which skin u got most high win rate naayil? >.<
[2:12:37] dabsus: not only can vayne tumble away from you, but she can also PUSH you away from her
[2:12:41] depressedshonen_: @thugpooh real
[2:12:52] 熊汶安齋拉拉水水: Aatrox's damage is mainly from his Q which is one of the most slow and stupid spell in game
[2:13:08] 熊汶安齋拉拉水水: And Vayne just point and click and auto attack
[2:13:18] LuckkyTM: smartest jungler

[2:26:36] kilwazol2: XD
[2:26:53] ragna_lich: most ranged champions are completely skilless. Some actually require at least something like jayce and stuff but still jayce doesn't have a lot of counterplay
[2:26:55] tabasco250ml: why would you count the e

[2:45:55] 3lvis22: kiting with 600ms when you can walk in and out of skillshots with no issue
[2:45:57] nazenaraa: kiting is hard ? chasing with vayne is even harder!
[2:45:58] dabsus: because she has high mobility

[2:46:15] DestroyerX311: i do not have problems with vayne as aatrox but thats probably because im in plat in people dont have hands in higher elo it might be hard to play against her

[2:52:25] sannyok456: i usually ban tf and ask my team to ban vayne, works almost always
[2:52:25] ragna_lich: i think bans should be fking tripled
[2:52:26] elrefaey: @kilwazol2 shit i should check

[2:52:37] kledble: G
[2:52:41] staub_finger: How hard is Karma Top for Aatrox? 󠀀

[2:52:48] ragna_lich: cassio top is rare tho
[2:52:50] kledble: graves top
[2:52:52] deviileyez: Cassiopeia is buffed or something?
[2:52:54] 1DavyJones_: honestly riot needs to nerf ghost and fleet footwork movement speed for ranged
[2:52:57] kledble: graves
[2:52:57] yuji57_: the fact that ppl need so many ban is a sign game is so coinflip
[2:52:59] sannyok456: @ragna_lich not really
[2:53:00] kiiranx33: should riot just ban ranged champs from going to top lane until 15mins lol
[2:53:09] holybooba: gg
[2:53:09] banevadeingkekekekek: Pick twisted fate then... Join the darkside
[2:53:12] grandeto: Karma i actually worst than vayne if you ask me.
[2:53:16] jeiss_v: @kiiranx33 how LOL
[2:53:21] kilwazol2: @kiiranx33 fr PepeLaugh
[2:53:22] elrefaey: Have wait you didn't lane against tristana top yet?
[2:53:24] ragna_lich: @sannyok456 she's very niche
[2:53:26] garoszjakalosz: akshan
[2:53:26] last__lotus: LMAO
[2:53:27] iamnotowen: Uninstall league to counter all pick
[2:53:29] tatami0_0: Range+swifties>any mele champ lol
[2:53:34] elguallo: I dont understand how some people defend ranged champs on topnale
[2:53:38] kilwazol2: @jeiss_v @jeiss_v invisible wall
[2:53:39] holybooba: dead
[2:53:40] 3lvis22: irelia

[2:53:48] seniurgato: warwick
[2:53:49] sannyok456: @ragna_lich im getting fisted by her 24/7
[2:53:59] YouLookFamiIiar: nothing
[2:54:02] armin0992: buff melee. fix the game
[2:54:03] intingkarthus: nothing
[2:54:05] jeiss_v: @kilwazol2 kindred and graves trying to gank be like 🧍
[2:54:06] chrono_ward: nothing
[2:54:10] chrono_ward: happens
[2:54:15] swisslion2806: @elguallo cuz they are either in low elo or shitty diamond in which they beat them on regular bases or play them themselves
[2:54:16] holybooba: farming lane
[2:54:17] kilwazol2: @jeiss_v rules are rules man
[2:54:17] chxsrd: @Naayil doesnt rumble literally counter 99% of top lane? ;D
[2:54:22] zoomumba10: garen xd
[2:54:29] amein16: How does mmr system work? @naayil
[2:54:31] jeiss_v: @kilwazol2 LOL
[2:54:31] kiiranx33: @jeiss_v iuno maybe got some invis barrier and that shit falls apart after 15 mins and only melee champs can go thru
[2:54:34] nazenaraa: thats why i play aatrox jgl
[2:54:36] kilwazol2: @jeiss_v give request to toplaner to give permission ig
[2:54:37] ragna_lich: @sannyok456 1% pick rate. Means u face cassio top 1/100 matches on average (in high elo, low elo she has way less wr)
[2:54:45] kingslayer91123: why don't you play lethality ?
[2:54:52] intingkarthus: Singed too oh my god it's so cancer
[2:55:09] chrono_ward: yeah theres singed also KEKW
[2:55:10] lunaticcyclone: is kennen broken
[2:55:13] 3lvis22: @ragna_lich he picked cassio when he banned 5 champs you on nothing bud
[2:55:14] pronvos: bust out assassin toplaner against ranged adc no?
[2:55:19] w0xell_: did you watch the clip of august talking about vayne top ?
[2:55:20] WoaDmulL: @Naayil is there a matchup you honestly think you should lose with Aatrox? Im talking about being counterpicked. Against which champ do you think should 100% lose?
[2:55:26] jecht_21: Hwei top xd
[2:55:27] kiiranx33: riot thinks vayne top is ok tho, didnt they make a fckn tweet about her
[2:55:36] nazenaraa: low elo is copy and paste from high elo, just in shit
[2:55:36] amein16: How does mmr system work? @naayil
[2:55:41] ragna_lich: @3lvis22 ?????
[2:55:44] sannyok456: @ragna_lich probably true, it's just this feels so bad that i only remember that
[2:55:51] swisslion2806: but how
[2:56:00] kiiranx33: ghost on ranged is more of a problem rn isnt it
[2:56:09] chrono_ward: its ghost and swifties and fleet
[2:56:15] ineptgumba: Isn't this more reason to expand your champ pool?
[2:56:21] ragna_lich: @sannyok456 she's strong but still niche. Kinda like singed. Not many people play singed but he's not weak
[2:56:23] thesheep43: Doesn't Jaycee have to go into melee range for kill?
[2:56:25] jeiss_v: why null magicc
[2:56:35] dylannk26: is aatrox bad in high elo?
[2:56:38] Morrismj: Gragas is fun
[2:56:39] staub_finger: Does one still build Edge of Night against Vayne?
[2:56:44] SavageToxi: you forgot about quinn
[2:56:44] amein16: How does mmr system work?
[2:56:55] EXxnightingale: these people dont enjoy jayce they just thirsty for lp
[2:56:56] ragna_lich: @thesheep43 depends, his trade patterns are complex
[2:56:58] s_logan_s: Jsjsbsbs
[2:57:01] YouLookFamiIiar: assassins are fun
[2:57:02] Bromatick: fiora? riven?
[2:57:02] lukamilikic99: you can play clit?
[2:57:03] kiiranx33: i find it kind of stupid you are forced to change your conq into comet sometimes
[2:57:05] intingkarthus: HalalKled
[2:57:09] seniurgato: @YouLookFamiIiar  BritishTroll
[2:57:12] AndreDF: BASED
[2:57:19] amein16: Gangplank
[2:57:22] 3lvis22: @ragna_lich he said vayne, tf, karma etc. and cassio later so what does cassio have anything to do with pick rate when she isnt even priority pick, no shit she doesnt get picked if 5 other champs are better
[2:57:25] holybooba: Jayce so fun
[2:57:27] lunaticcyclone: I enjoy playing garen :)
[2:57:34] Quesitou: I play since season 2 KEKW
[2:57:35] pronvos: riven was something
[2:57:36] sannyok456: @ragna_lich i dont know what niche honestly. singed is, but cassio is legit a cancer cell cheatcode
[2:57:40] chxsrd: i play since season 1 and every single champ is depressing, i hate every champ LUL
[2:57:40] nazenaraa: just play vayne, heard she is fine XD
[2:57:42] Quesitou: It's been a long while
[2:57:42] supremeleaderfokou: maybe do something like drututt to find a new champ
[2:57:43] intingkarthus: RIVENING
[2:57:51] jeiss_v: jayce and yone are lowk rlly fun, i dont play them a lot sadly
[2:57:55] grandeto: The only champion I have fun with exept Aatrox si Azri  @Naayil
[2:57:57] ragna_lich: @3lvis22 i wasn't talking to him, i was talking with another person. Maybe check context before yelling
[2:58:03] amein16: Gangplank is a fun good champ overall
[2:58:03] kingslayer91123: what do you think about fiora or renekton
[2:58:07] nazenaraa: what about mordekaiser
[2:58:10] starrplatinummm: But do you prefer the old aatrox or the new
[2:58:14] mahmouder1: play irlelia xd
[2:58:22] pronvos: bro straight up became aatrox
[2:58:24] holybooba: but riven has a good pair
[2:58:29] niba0706: yone!
[2:58:30] zDeadshotEU: I’ve been playing riven since i started league in s10 no other champ is as fun so i know what you mean idc if I get countered
[2:58:33] zoomumba10: @naayil  i bet u would love fiora no joke
[2:58:35] amein16: What about gangplank??
[2:58:36] ragna_lich: mordekaiser has no skill period
[2:58:38] yuji57_: lee sin is there for so long and is the best champ ever made. skill expression, balanced, fun, cool design…
[2:58:50] Bromatick: camille?
[2:58:54] c3p0demadeira: what champ you banning?
[2:58:55] yukinobestgirl: @Naayil the reason why you feel this way is because you tied your identity to being the Aatrox challenger guy. You're closing doors on other champs because you won't be "special" on them.
[2:59:01] z4yyyl: k sante???
[2:59:04] 1DavyJones_: but against some certain picks like illaoi and yorick, Mordekaiser really comes in handy
[2:59:06] zyadsayed134679: Fiora?
[2:59:06] amein16: Gangplank?
[2:59:09] tatami0_0: Mb Udyr he is GIGACHAD no ??
[2:59:12] 3lvis22: @ragna_lich oh right sorry mate, 7tv sucks sometimes
[2:59:21] ragna_lich: @sannyok456 most cassio top players are legitimately good at her. She may seem broken but she's actually not that easy
[2:59:22] zoomumba10: naayil fiora main???
[2:59:39] thesheep43: Do you like Illaoi? @naayil
[2:59:42] kiiranx33: @tatami0_0 trick2g constantly opening enemy base with him
[2:59:48] 0suwu: i feel ya for me its kayn i enjoy  league  cuz kayn exist
[2:59:50] yukinobestgirl: It's not insecurity, it's natural, it's how humans are. It doesn't make you insecure
[2:59:57] z4yyyl: How about k santa
[2:59:58] lunaticcyclone: naayil Jax main
[3:00:02] niba0706: what ab yone
[3:00:02] z4yyyl: sante
[3:00:02] supremeleaderfokou: i have kind of the same issue, i played 147 champs last season, i only liked azir and akali a lot
[3:00:09] ldking: why not play nida top ?
[3:00:12] EmilThanksYou: @0suwu kayn is but also easy yk
[3:00:23] 1DavyJones_: oh, u're playing vs Boda, an Egyptian pro player
[3:00:40] armin0992: how did you find new aatrox is fun
[3:00:47] holybooba: atrox is love
[3:00:56] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[3:01:02] 3lvis22: you want to play aatrox not league damn
[3:01:05] niba0706: YONE IS FUN!
[3:01:15] dariusliebert: naayil narrating me at school xd
[3:01:20] starrplatinummm: Wow pause range top?
[3:01:28] yukinobestgirl: Didn't Drututt used to have the same mindset with Camille but he changed over time and began to enjoy other champs and feel like it was worth playing them
[3:01:31] kiiranx33: naafiri? you had some games in korea with her
[3:01:33] kingslayer91123: gp
[3:01:38] FreshWithKeys: i only play yone and aatrox these days
[3:01:45] 0suwu: @EmilThanksYou its not about how hard the champs i play all champs but kayn design and game plays is fun for me
[3:01:50] 3lvis22: @yukinobestgirl i dont think he was a real otp otp
[3:01:58] sannyok456: @ragna_lich being broken is about winrate rather than skill ceiling. when there the strongest champs om lane are 53% ranges, it's nothing about skill at all
[3:02:12] niba0706: Are u saying aatrox is bad then
[3:02:26] pronvos: all those m7 grinders be like
[3:02:28] EmilThanksYou: @0suwu yeah kayn have a nice attack build
[3:02:40] c3p0demadeira: ekko griefer
[3:02:41] 1DavyJones_: @amein16 he plays for a team called NGX in Arabian League
[3:02:42] starrplatinummm: I only play sett i enjoy even tho i know it a shit champ sometimes
[3:02:50] ragna_lich: @sannyok456 yea but vayne has same wr as cassio with 4x the pick rate. It's different
[3:03:01] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[3:03:10] holybooba: ima go play sum vayne toplane now, not for the lp but for the fun..
[3:03:23] 3lvis22: @sannyok456 winrate is not everthing, hard champs have low wr because otherwise they would be op
[3:03:30] yukinobestgirl: @niba0706 aatrox is limited if you play it every single game. if you play other stuff to mitigate being counterpicked on first rotation then there probably isn't much of a limit. it's not about him being "weak"
[3:03:36] starrplatinummm: @holybooba  wow pause don't do it
[3:03:43] OskarG88: !opgg
[3:03:43] Nightbot: https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=naayil
[3:03:48] forfinality: -1
[3:03:50] dylannk26: what do you like about aatrox that you don't find in other champs?
[3:03:53] theraluxu: -1
[3:03:58] intingkarthus: -1
[3:04:03] kiiranx33: the main population of ranged top laners are on ur yt comments bro lmao you farming them lowkey abit of them on twitter too
[3:04:24] 3lvis22: @yukinobestgirl pro players pick aatrox as a counter pick when he is good
[3:04:31] 0suwu: @EmilThanksYou the two form in one that have different  gameplay his quoats the mobiltys even his disigne most darkkin are cool tbh
[3:04:42] rejierock: TRUEEEE
[3:04:50] kranuhiisi: @Naayil do u play eclipse aatrox ? if not whats the best recommended build atm
[3:04:52] Aqualixlol: funda mentos
[3:05:17] EmilThanksYou: @0suwu i like his blue side bcs its so nice when a champ have speed and dmg
[3:05:22] demetris_bottleman: what do you do against yasuo top?
[3:05:26] rejierock: skill/mastery matchup
[3:05:31] kiiranx33: even right now you
[3:05:36] noumenonzz: speaking too much facts naayil
[3:06:00] bms_tao: kayle doesnt count @Naayil
[3:06:06] armin0992: players who play bot champs in toplane are insecure femboy with no father figure who get stomped in bot from mid and jg ganks so they take their disgusting champs where then can abuse it
[3:06:10] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[3:06:10] kiiranx33: you would defo ban vayne over irelia or yone now right
[3:06:18] sannyok456: @3lvis22 so they keep no skill champs at 54% winrate because otherwise it will be unfair? how having hardest champs weaker is better for the game than vayne toplane?
[3:06:20] jeiss_v: profane on jayce looks intresting :o might try
[3:06:21] armin0992: ranged top champs are fine
[3:06:30] grandeto: You are like AK 47, When you start talking about Range top laners :D:D:D:D @Naayil
[3:06:36] kiiranx33: it seems like irelia/yone have been less aids compared to vayne
[3:06:42] Quesitou: Profane hydra
[3:06:44] Quesitou: Probably
[3:06:48] Qualmknoedel: profane hydra
[3:06:51] 0suwu: @EmilThanksYou yeah going zoomiz tho i miss old kayn in s7-8 he was like current aatrox
[3:06:52] noumenonzz: make toplane great again or we riot
[3:06:59] Colarboy: !opgg
[3:06:59] Nightbot: https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=naayil
[3:07:02] yukinobestgirl: new vayne is fun in a "teemo" kind of way xd
[3:07:04] Morrismj: who do u ban?
[3:07:09] kiiranx33: phreak does not care about top lmao
[3:07:24] Karifax: i guess nobody cares about "fair matchup" or "skill" if you want to win the game and climb
[3:07:27] rejierock: what can u say about drutt doing ranged top @Naayil
[3:07:32] niba0706: @kiiranx33 bro aatrox counters yone in my opinion why is the whole chat and him always saying yone is busted
[3:07:32] noumenonzz: shen
[3:07:40] zeff_____: irelia?
[3:07:40] ziutek18: @kiiranx33 he plays range top xd
[3:07:44] EmilThanksYou: @0suwu i dont know how he was there bcs i started in season 12
[3:07:46] sannyok456: even fiora literally 10 times better then vayne lmao true
[3:07:48] Air_Agu: yorick
[3:07:51] yuurika_rain: Singed
[3:07:53] intingkarthus: Singed
[3:07:56] Feinjir: gragas is so interactive
[3:08:00] 1DavyJones_: what if riot just forces certain champs for a certain lane? wouldn't that be a perfect world?
[3:08:10] yukinobestgirl: this guy is awful LOL
[3:08:11] EmilThanksYou: @Air_Agu yorick is ok
[3:08:14] yukinobestgirl: the jayce
[3:08:16] Karifax: profane hydra?
[3:08:22] chxsrd: whole game is toxic tho, jgl champs are gamebreaking, azir/hwei are op, bot lane meta is also fked. Everything is just Z-tier meta abuse
[3:08:39] jecht_21: Irelia is a good champ tho
[3:08:39] ragna_lich: gragas is strong but calling him uninteractive is wrong. He's a very confrontational champion
[3:08:52] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[3:08:54] kiiranx33: @niba0706 is it easier to counter yone now after the lethal tempo changes or is there no diff
[3:08:54] EmilThanksYou: @1DavyJones_ the problem is its not working bcs a toplaner could play a meele jngler and the jnlge a range and then the switch
[3:09:21] niba0706: @EmilThanksYou compared to aatrox its not bro, i played against yorick one time and he was just outrading me and almost winning ffights when i was 5/0 and he was 0/5
[3:09:28] zoomumba10: lethal tempo nerfed
[3:09:29] starrplatinummm: Does aatrox counters sett or Darius?
[3:09:37] jeiss_v: yeahhh
[3:09:41] JoseDFP500: what about gwen
[3:09:47] thesheep43: Wouldn't it be better to ask the jgl to not come top? So they don't interrupt the 1vs1 skill matchup
[3:09:47] Karifax: yone scaling
[3:09:48] grandeto: How you play against Yone, I mean what is the way to outplay him?
[3:09:52] 1DavyJones_: @EmilThanksYou yea but at least that would eliminate the chances of having vayne , tf or kalista top
[3:10:16] 0suwu: yone is a stat abuser he dont need kills if he get iteams he hard scale
[3:10:17] demetris_bottleman: what is the counterplay to yasuo? feels like nightmare when i play aatrox vs yasuo
[3:10:26] 1DavyJones_: @1DavyJones_ i mean the roles which have champs in common would be ok
[3:10:27] zaaaamnom: @Naayil should i go comet against cassio
[3:10:34] zoomumba10: naayil potent sees fiora as a early mid game champion, is aatrox that bad late game?
[3:10:37] milosdermored: @Naayil And how u win against the fucking maokai, I never ever won vs that shit
[3:10:47] beelzeburst: at least there is some stimulation with yone lol
[3:10:53] niba0706: @grandeto play against him lvl1, trust im not copoing aatrox is stronger lvl1 then yonme
[3:11:00] EmilThanksYou: @1DavyJones_ yeah i wish that would be so bcs league is not fun with range matchups
[3:11:10] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[3:11:18] FreshWithKeys: @niba0706 i think yone is stronger lvl 1
[3:11:34] intingkarthus: AYAYA
[3:11:46] niba0706: @FreshWithKeys maybe if he plays great
[3:11:59] garoszjakalosz: wow your jg is pog
[3:12:00] 0suwu: mario what was that
[3:12:03] janyagent: WHAT U THINK ABOUT PROFANE ON AATROX?
[3:12:07] EmilThanksYou: guys do somone have a websitte where stands what to buy or runes against every champ
[3:12:11] kiiranx33: riot should really start to change the ghost speed for ranged champs bruh that spell too strong for them on such a low cd as well

[3:13:03] janyagent: WHAT U THINK ABOUT PROFANE ON AATROX?
[3:13:04] omegeboi: !build
[3:13:04] 3lvis22: @niba0706 depends if you dodge his q's too i guess, saw aatrox win all in lvl 2 vs darius but you have to hit every Q and dodge his Q
[3:13:04] lovesdrama: Did the lethaltempo make yone weak or is he still strong?
[3:13:07] Boldigeci: I think now that eclipse doesn't have lethality it might not be that desirable?
[3:13:09] Boldigeci: Not sure
[3:13:15] semiu01: for top lane I think if he was mid lane it’s fine I think I’m not sure
[3:13:17] milosdermored: @Naayil do you find this new itemization for aatrox better then the previous one.... do u miss gore?
[3:13:27] le_jackalz: if you play rynd you can feel it
[3:13:28] 0suwu: btw is profine rush good compared to sunder
[3:13:34] Takowey: lethal tempo nerf is so big, cut to half basically

[3:16:18] kranuhiisi: what do u play if aatrox banned ? @Naayil
[3:16:18] Takowey: @kranuhiisi not true, some dogs are uncarriable, he just needs 1000 games a season to climb
[3:16:20] alex99mk: was bist du fürn landsmann
[3:16:21] EmilThanksYou: @Zulfiikaar im in bronze 2 and playing against silver-low gold

[3:17:06] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou ye you are bad and thats it
[3:17:20] 3lvis22: people reach master with 90% wr

[3:17:56] kiiranx33: worthless on my team but somehow deleting my allies when he's on the enemy side
[3:18:06] 3lvis22: @ShuIkin they start in emerald already so no
[3:18:06] Air_Agu: juys tbeing adc is ass
[3:18:08] Karifax: jhin requiers skill to be good
[3:18:13] quality_soy: @ShuIkin ? what why would them starting in iron make them have 90% wr?
[3:18:18] Livi_Monster: well he feels like he is never a threat
[3:18:19] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou you are you not 11 0 then
[3:18:20] Bromatick: actually true
[3:18:24] lovesdrama: isnt aatrox good against range top matchups?
[3:18:25] 3lvis22: @3lvis22 *why
[3:18:33] sbr_27: Is austria better than Germany?
[3:18:35] EmilThanksYou: @3lvis22 i heard many challengers are stuck in emerald bcs of thier mates
[3:18:53] Hackeronii: @sbr_27 yes
[3:18:55] markojim7: what happened off stream?
[3:18:56] kralzo: LUL bro is delulu
[3:18:58] 3lvis22: nobody is stuck emerald, its just a meme
[3:19:02] amein16: @lovesdrama not vayne
[3:19:05] Takowey: @3lvis22 they get into smurfs queue and they dont have normal lp gains, what is ur point?
[3:19:11] milosdermored: @Naayil do you find this new itemization for aatrox better then the previous one.... do u miss gore?
[3:19:21] 3lvis22: @Takowey still 90% wr so what is yours
[3:19:34] niba0706: @lovesdrama still annoying
[3:19:43] Takowey: @3lvis22 they use new accounts, once they start losing they just switch lmao thats my point
[3:19:46] Zulfiikaar: @emilthanksyou Even ur team is 0/11 u must be in 11/0 every game in bronze If u want grind if u cant carry u deserved ur elo is simple
[3:20:05] ItenDock: i miss the old aurelion sol RaccAttack
[3:20:09] kiiranx33: this game constantly changing and shaking it up so we cant really get attached to stuff huh
[3:20:10] sbr_27: This skin's splash art is the biggest bait. He looks like Santa's elf ingame
[3:20:14] lovesdrama: i miss old aatrox
[3:20:15] mhrocha: gargoyle removal was a shot in the heart for tank players
[3:20:22] 3lvis22: @Takowey i dont think ratirl does that and he has 80% wr last time i checked in master 400lp
[3:20:25] Feinjir: @sbr_27  kek

[3:21:13] EmilThanksYou: @Zulfiikaar yeah its dependes on my champ im switching too much, if yone or hard tank im carryng but on aatrox (im learning him) im only winning lane
[3:21:14] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou you are not even emerald so that argument means nothing anyways

[3:21:43] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou then why are you crying, you dont know the champs
[3:21:54] kiiranx33: btw is jung still the most broken role or has it shifted
[3:22:04] vuckooooo1: Anyone knows what happend with LCK?
[3:22:06] OskarG88: was W changed?
[3:22:11] Xyntectic: @EmilThanksYou bro i was maining mid zed and switched back to my old main which is kayn jg and i am climbing so rapidly its not even funny
[3:22:12] 3lvis22: @3lvis22 you make 100 other mistakes in lane anyways
[3:22:18] starrplatinummm: @kostas_01  ye bro Tuesday at 2 am
[3:22:19] Xyntectic: just spam your main
[3:22:20] omegeboi: @kiiranx33 its midline
[3:22:21] EmilThanksYou: @3lvis22 im not crying i just said that in low elows are many feeders
[3:22:21] Xyntectic: and you will climb
[3:22:35] thedreadfulgamer64: This pyke is really good
[3:22:40] amein16: W pyke
[3:22:45] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou that happends in high elo too and its worse cuz people know how to carry
[3:22:49] kiiranx33: thats the thing though, mid and jg always say their opposite's roles are the most broken
[3:22:50] Feinjir: @EmilThanksYou there are feeders everywhere
[3:22:57] hannibal720: @3lvis22 I'm plat player and my last 20 games are decided which team has the level 30 first time ranked ever
[3:22:58] EmilThanksYou: @Xyntectic i also switched one night to yone and had such a blue carpet it was crazy
[3:22:59] kiiranx33: then i look at top and ask why not top as well
[3:23:00] supremeleaderfokou: true but how could you change it?
[3:23:15] bigAL935: one of the problem of both those roles is, how to balance them but still keep them fun
[3:23:34] c3p0demadeira: top resources are op though
[3:24:05] ISSY_Python121: my balls are also op I fear
[3:24:12] EmilThanksYou: @3lvis22 yeah i think i need to improve my knowledge for items and runes and eveyrthing
[3:24:18] OskarG88: have 1 hand
[3:24:20] theksubi: drututt once said that anyone could get plat if they play enough. agree or disagree
[3:24:22] AtheistMonke_: @ISSY_Python121 real
[3:24:24] shaodong1: GG
[3:24:32] TheAmser: but the jungler cant do anything on lost lanes,just winning and tied lanes
[3:24:35] AtheistMonke_: they werent indeed not able to finish
[3:24:43] Feinjir: @theksubi i think anyone can get to masters if they play enough
[3:24:45] zoomumba10: bedt quote?
[3:24:52] limuleev: jayce was special in mental way
[3:24:57] lovesdrama: u have to have hands
[3:25:04] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou those are minor things, you have to learn laning fundamentals, with waves and shit like that
[3:25:06] shaodong1: jungle is nerfed so much in comparison to s13..
[3:25:07] Zulfiikaar: @emilthanksyou ye maybe focus on 1-2 champ and stop switch always im playin 1 champ actually im d4 so for me this is a reason for grind
[3:25:16] therzvsm: !opgg
[3:25:16] Nightbot: https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=naayil
[3:25:19] yuji57_: yeah jgl is broken but even the hardest role, supp is broken and easy
[3:25:27] supremeleaderfokou: support is kinda fine imo cause it makes or breakes the bot lane
[3:25:29] ISSY_Python121: condition yourself into edging top resources
[3:25:39] 3lvis22: @3lvis22 if you got coached by someone it would take like 30 minutes to analyze the first 10 minutes
[3:25:52] nevanx93: @theamser Theres no lane that can carry if all your team mates are losing
[3:25:58] theclawq: ye.and it's so fkn anoying that a jg can flip the game in just 1 early invade
[3:26:01] yuurika_rain: this jayce ICANT
[3:26:08] EmilThanksYou: @3lvis22 lane is easy im winning it but mid and late game is a problem im runnning like a chicken
[3:26:18] bigAL935: @nevanx93 jg cant carry if all 3 losing lanes as well
[3:26:23] mixacarryou1: what do you think about patch 14.5
[3:26:25] kiiranx33: @Naayil you don't prefer midlane now as much compared to before? comparing top and mid resources does grub take the priority now is that why you pref top?
[3:26:50] ralzephyep: @yuji57_ supp is easy at the cost of not getting nearly as many resources
[3:26:51] vuckooooo1: Is there any updates on patch 14.05?
[3:26:58] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[3:27:04] nevanx93: @bigal935 and do you think any other role can carry if the other lanes(jg include) are losing?
[3:27:13] TheAmser: @nevanx93 but u can win lane at least,jungler cant do,if lanes ahead the jungler can be an easy kill for the laner
[3:27:16] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[3:27:24] Tsuboy29: Yes it was XD
[3:27:28] arskapupu: @Naayil Have you noticed the W tether changes much?
[3:27:30] bobtroll690: i had sona supp that never left bot and enemy had pantheon that roamed 7 times in mid so ofc they won
[3:27:33] thabigman: do you like the bruiser build more than profane/lethality
[3:27:51] theclawq: @ralzephyep bro if you full clear into a gank at bot u can buy a fully item
[3:27:51] ShuIkin: it was dogshit before, now its not even a spell
[3:27:54] itzrashhh: what are the changes?
[3:27:56] ISSY_Python121: always has been always will be, worst spell in the game
[3:27:57] 3lvis22: @EmilThanksYou still you make mistakes, there is the thing about thinking you are doing something good because it worked, like playing aggro with no vision, it works in low elo cuz you dont get punished but in high elo you will
[3:28:04] EmilThanksYou: @3lvis22 im watching playershub if he have something on my mains
[3:28:17] yuji57_: @ralzephyep u should watch your replay, supp items gives as much money as a 7/8cs per minute gold in laning phase
[3:28:20] EmilThanksYou: @3lvis22 yeah true
[3:28:24] Xunn2: heyy nayil first time watching the stream i am from youtube !
[3:28:28] nevanx93: @theamser We are discussing your same logic, why would you think laners can carry even if jg is losing? I mean letd suppose you are a mid laner, what can you do if top, jg and bot are losing?
[3:28:29] kurohitsugiLOL: +1300 one auto
[3:28:30] kiiranx33: isnt his passive also kinda meh, why didnt they just bake it into his E or his ult
[3:28:34] sebik604: @Naayil What was the incident
[3:28:37] KamusLoL: !specs
[3:28:47] z3urnwi: just got autofilled supp, picked aatrox, won the lane but lost the game lol
[3:28:49] xx312lowxx: 2 people on one team 1v9ning how dies that even work?
[3:29:00] arskapupu: theydidthemath
[3:29:04] omegeboi: my sterak dosent do that xD
[3:29:07] 3lvis22: @nevanx93 depends on your champ and how fed you are, some games are unwinnable but sometimes you can carry
[3:29:22] shyammm: Wat off stream incident
[3:29:46] ralzephyep: @yuji57_ in laning phase sure, but you also (if good) are supposed to give plates to adc, and you are expected to know when to roam and hover etc. its easy to perform but u do need good game sense
[3:29:52] kilwazol2: why is she so tanky
[3:29:58] ralzephyep: @yuji57_ u also fall off econ wise late game a ton
[3:30:19] ShuIkin: broken champs vs. better players thats why this game is so long lol
[3:30:21] nevanx93: @3lvis22 point is, you need at least one winning lane it doesnt matter the role/lane, but junglers and supports are the one that can "support the game" and help teammates to carry harder
[3:30:28] kiiranx33: maybe give back blood well lmao compensate for the shitty w pulls we gotta deal with
[3:30:51] theclawq: XD

[3:31:22] bobtroll690: gg
[3:31:32] 3lvis22: @nevanx93 depends, some champs can solo 1v9, and still you dont need wining lanes, even "even" lanes are lanes that are useful
[3:31:36] ShuIkin: jayce trolled with his build for sure
[3:31:36] limuleev: mentally special
[3:31:47] OskarG88: being special is good no? Kappa
