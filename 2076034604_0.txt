[0:02:17] charvos1: hello my dearest sweetheart
[0:02:21] PNWMalice: I’m going back to adc, do you think zeri  is an ideal pick around D3 - D4?
[0:02:30] TheSameKnight: Hello wawa
[0:02:32] lil_suushi: big boy ^^
[0:02:37] Sewiii: hello there king
[0:02:37] darthbid: Have you seen? Now kog can run it down faster
[0:03:00] PNWMalice: preciate you king
[0:03:08] Harmtaro: they buffed passive ms speed too

[0:03:19] smel1k: Hello everyone
[0:03:43] h0llw: yeah that shit is useless
[0:04:23] charvos1: ultimate bravery passive
[0:04:34] JekeDano: what about sion, kinda the same no?
[0:04:36] h0llw: i think the weird think as well is that all his abilities scale with good ap ratios but he builds on hit
[0:04:37] lil_suushi: do u know trymbi?
[0:04:40] xcalebur: he should get ghosting on hitting a champ
[0:04:45] xcalebur: sions a tank its fine jeke
[0:04:46] Durmanush: I wanna die when I play kog maw
[0:04:46] lil_suushi: like know as in are u friends? ^^

[0:05:26] charvos1: u have way more agency when u die as sion too lol
[0:05:55] h0llw: the issue is that kog main dmg is autos and he cant even do that lol
[0:05:56] xcalebur: wow trymbi hates you

[0:06:16] lil_suushi: rogue trymbi peajj
[0:06:18] lil_suushi: peak
[0:06:28] lil_suushi: wait did he choose adc?
[0:06:37] PNWMalice: it’s like karthus, most of his identity is going in to pump out damage,  kog with his passive does not fit his kit at all
[0:06:37] ivanega0: hi

[0:15:50] charvos1: for the lec team probably
[0:15:51] PNWMalice: it’s probably not bad, but because lethal tempo is more popular it doesn’t seem as useful
[0:15:55] FenrirRoselia: blitz mind control him EZ
[0:16:04] PNWMalice: and no lethality feels bad
[0:16:06] xcalebur: its in madrid i believe

[0:18:11] 9mune: what if that is actually them in real life but u never met them becuase they never left their house?
[0:18:15] Durmanush: LUL
[0:18:17] LoLCryner: Just to be devils advocate since i agree with you, but people normally often have clients that they dont like or are annoying.. yet they are still "paying customers" they have to endure
[0:18:30] paafegal: they can, doesnt mean they should xd
[0:18:43] charvos1: consumers is crazy

[0:26:27] CarsBeek: Bruh, dont feel bad for them, never got bad thoughts if LP are free
[0:26:42] h0llw: this katarina is lost wtf
[0:26:43] ivanega0: you dont like playing kalista?

[0:27:54] winibale: @legendz411 what order
[0:27:54] dea1hwish: but intresting thing, is kraken still good on kaisa? or if you need ad, you just build eclipse -> guinso -> other items? @Jackspektra
[0:28:04] PNWMalice: I’ll take any kaisa build that’s not umbral glaive
[0:28:23] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[0:28:26] legendz411: @winibale no idea, but ive seen it on kaisa players.
[0:28:32] LysooLoL: have u tried shadowflame?
[0:28:35] 365Doors: its fun to finally see eclipse somewhere again
[0:28:51] Fightin4Fun: Can you explain why cryptbloom is good on kaisa? @jackspektra
[0:29:12] dreamondreamer2: interesting build
[0:29:23] xcalebur: ap, magic pen, ability haste whats not to like Fightin4Fun
[0:29:47] lil_suushi: do you have your own gaming room?
[0:29:51] TheSameKnight: But why over void?
[0:29:57] Fightin4Fun: @xcalebur just didn't understand why you'd take it over void staff
[0:29:59] TheSameKnight: Is void that bad?
[0:30:02] zengetsuad: isnt it just muramanne, ludens into crypto? especially when u got 2 ads in team
[0:30:22] legendz411: @Fightin4Fun i think they take cyyptobloom for the lulz
[0:30:25] Hauf_: @TheSameKnight ability haste on ap kaisa is really valuable this season
[0:30:29] PNWMalice: ability haste is really hard to go
[0:30:35] PNWMalice: get*
[0:30:51] TheSameKnight: Got it
[0:30:54] legendz411: o
[0:31:29] TheSameKnight: Cam horizon focus be good on kaisa then?
[0:31:30] Fightin4Fun: Cryptbloom just saved kha lul
[0:31:33] marssh1: @Jackspektra considering almost all champs have lots of damage, what is the actual role of an adc player?
[0:31:41] marssh1: like what is ur job to win the game
[0:31:56] LapisLazulies: adc job is hit towers/objectives and stay alive
[0:32:28] marssh1: bro right hwn i ask that question i get 2 minute ad
[0:32:43] dreamondreamer2: he said that adcs still have the most dps
[0:32:52] marssh1: @LapisLazulies thats it tho? other champs are better at taking towers
[0:33:11] EmperorSadge: why are we complicating the game
[0:33:19] EmperorSadge: adcs are meant to suck
[0:33:23] EmperorSadge: LUL
[0:33:25] TheSameKnight: Other champions can't take towers safe enough
[0:33:32] thebuzzzkilla: @EmperorSadge +
[0:33:55] marssh1: @TheSameKnight i guess thats a fair point
[0:33:57] Sewiii: I need to say Jack, when my support goes 0/10, I literally start to hear your advice that I need to calm down to be better and carry that BillyApprove
[0:34:21] aleedevil: i dont know what to do
[0:34:24] marssh1: my main issue for playing adc is im a heavy tilter, and u cant be a tilter when u play adc
[0:34:30] aleedevil: LAS  and BR are in maintaining
[0:34:32] LapisLazulies: yea and your dps is needed for killing objectives like nash/drag quickly
[0:35:12] dreamondreamer2: i dont think adc is bad but it can be frustrating becuase there are games where from start to end you feel like you cannot do shit,
[0:35:22] LapisLazulies: yea that happens on every role tho
[0:35:28] dreamondreamer2: and yeh u really have to have a strong mental
[0:35:31] marssh1: yeah @dreamondreamer2 i agree. I feel like playing adc 50% is just keeping good mental
[0:35:49] nightmarehost982: early stream today
[0:35:51] marssh1: @LapisLazulies not the same way as adc
[0:35:54] mmmmmils: damn slight ad gapp
[0:35:58] el_danixd: nah honestly i think adc is a shit role if u dont play mages or shit like senna. either crit needs buffs or make it so we're not 3-4 levels behind every toplaner
[0:36:08] el_danixd: (in soloq) pro play is different'
[0:36:08] LapisLazulies: i main adc I know how victim it feels sometimes
[0:36:15] LapisLazulies: but when ive played other roles its the same kinda thing
[0:36:21] LapisLazulies: play jungle with 3 losing lanes isnt fun either
[0:36:25] patkanik: I rather have 17:3 mid or jungle than ADC
[0:36:28] LapisLazulies: mid with losing bot isnt fun etc etc
[0:36:29] TIBET1337: i got 5 ranked match restrict, played 5 draft rift games but still can't go ranked
[0:36:35] TIBET1337: does someone how to fix this
[0:37:11] dreamondreamer2: yeh but at least in mid u always get to play the early laning phase 1v1 ost of the time
[0:37:15] thebuzzzkilla: @tibet1337 RIOT support
[0:37:20] yeandhi: bomba
[0:37:25] dreamondreamer2: if u get supp diffed you cant even lane
[0:37:30] PNWMalice: yeah ezreal human I think
[0:37:33] mmmmmils: feel like only problem with ad is u litterly lane with another guy not like mid/top and you always behind on lvls and cant roam. Like champs and items are fine IMO
[0:38:07] Durmanush: but if I don't blame role I have to blame myself, and I don't like that
[0:38:10] slinky177: mental is so important for this game ive found
[0:38:12] stalberi: very true
[0:38:18] Sw3eZ: @Jackspektra can u show me build, just tuned in? :)

[0:38:48] slinky177: as soon as i got an ego ingame but kept chat off i started climbing
[0:38:49] TIBET1337: @thebuzzzkilla ICANT
[0:38:58] el_danixd: good take. my issue is i just tilt cuz of sup/jgl. can u give me tips on mental?
[0:39:13] thebuzzzkilla: Carrying as adc is harder in emerald than 300lp Legit
[0:39:13] marssh1: @Jackspektra but for u, ur team prob plays around u a lot, because they know ur a pro player and good
[0:39:43] Sw3eZ: soloq is so diff from pro
[0:39:48] el_danixd: is kaisa viable now?
[0:39:51] Papafotios: boss how u doing i just came back from vacations whats the best adc's atm ?
[0:40:06] Sewiii: maybe next game Ashe gaming?
[0:40:14] 1lmann2: sup king 👑
[0:40:17] PNWMalice: so true king
[0:40:22] paafegal: @marssh1 also imagine saying that knowing  he got there before in the first place
[0:40:31] el_danixd: what is smolder build rn?
[0:40:39] marssh1: @paafegal i didnt mean it the way it came off
[0:40:49] thebuzzzkilla: What about Rammus adc @Jackspektra
[0:40:53] Papafotios: senna build?
[0:40:55] el_danixd: @thebuzzzkilla yea ur cooked
[0:40:55] slinky177: youve gotta have an ego to limit test but you cant let your failures get to you too much either
[0:40:58] Crownsh0t: do u max w or e second on that kaisa build
[0:40:59] exerciseball: fasting senna or adc?
[0:41:08] laskaat: How bad is kalista after nerf?
[0:41:19] paafegal: @marssh1 the thing is people in that elo all have ego and theyll try to be the protagonist because its soloq
[0:41:22] marssh1: who is the best soloq player thats not a pro in euw?
[0:41:36] satty12345: curious, which division would you consider high elo?
[0:41:53] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!

[0:42:13] Rikux13: thats build with kaisa works?
[0:42:16] thebuzzzkilla: You cant just say master 0lp is high elo...
[0:42:21] xcalebur: apex tier
[0:42:33] marssh1: masters is high elo to the average player
[0:42:42] el_danixd: u go eclipse, nashor, criptbloom
[0:42:43] el_danixd: ?
[0:42:44] Papafotios: senna build as adc?
[0:43:01] 1lmann2: agurin goat
[0:43:11] xcalebur: alan
[0:43:14] yonestic1: hans sama is smurfing every time he climbs
[0:43:16] 1lmann2: cuz he can
[0:43:19] 1lmann2: ig
[0:43:26] wichii1: dont you think erl leagues are a lil bit to small for you?
[0:43:29] Aniki_The_Forbidden_One: shyv and zyra jungle
[0:44:02] Sw3eZ: @Jackspektra u even go eclipse on autoattack kaisa?

[2:54:35] entertz: luck is real in life
[2:54:44] caraig2003: that's called matchmaking xdd
[2:55:10] Vxfboy: So you don't like that they reset the leaderboards more often now compared to last season?
[2:55:21] shiwamamo: do you think a master peaker can get early season chall with that logic ?
[2:55:45] thebuzzzkilla: I had single digit wr start of last season GIGACHAD
[2:56:00] entertz: wouldnt it be better to increase decay as LP gets higher?
[2:56:06] shiwamamo: u mean
[2:56:07] caraig2003: That's why I don't grind much in early season or split 1

[2:59:47] t1_sato: <3
[2:59:52] cVlak: @nousagi2529 well ye sometimes might be true, but if you are onetricking and know your limits, you still can easily win lane cause people play what is op and dont really know the limits

[3:04:42] shiwamamo: I guess
[3:05:18] lanzi1: has anyone used draven only 24 hour stream
