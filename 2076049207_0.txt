[4:03:59] ruhtrast1: my friend don t want to listen me when i say Sett is actually a weak champion and need a buff xdddd i don t know how to make them see the truth about sett
[4:04:56] kami776x: where would u put sett on a tier list this season
[4:05:50] pana000: sett is so terrible my god, why is riot not buffing him a bit, not dmg, utility
[4:06:09] 葉の小さい: oh no
[4:06:30] ruhtrast1: @pana000 everyone know why....that s because he s strong in low elo
[4:06:46] 葉の小さい: rip coins
[4:07:02] ruhtrast1: that s all :'(

[4:09:03] neptunesxdl: have u seen camille support yet ?
[4:09:11] Gyva_: Love to see you play Sett tho, im learning
[4:10:45] ruhtrast1: @pana000 yes but i think that more than that sett is a champion difficult to buff because he is a champ who need high stat to be played and if they buff him too much he could return to his broken stat
[4:10:51] ruhtrast1: state
[4:11:05] ruhtrast1: that s what i think maybe that s not that
[4:12:58] ruhtrast1: I really love Sett but i don t think we re going to see a buff now
[4:14:42] cloudpunch01: good morning, how are you
[4:15:02] xeon77x: its sad to see
[4:17:09] ruhtrast1: i m a low elo player so i don t complain about Sett because he is strong in my elo but i really love to see high elo sett gameplay but actually he is really weak so no one want to play him except main or OTP  Sett like you @AutolykusLoL
[4:18:09] amiro2000: he is a dead champion
[4:18:15] xeon77x: would you trade half the w dmg for half the cd? guess so
[4:18:23] ruhtrast1: and my friend don t want to understand how weak the champion is actually....
[4:18:27] xeon77x: like max 1.3k true dmg late game or so
[4:18:57] xeon77x: or maybe even 40 % of the dmg for half the cd
[4:19:08] DiarShirou: just play morde then if u go 0-10  aut0Clown
[4:20:14] xeon77x: like i think 9 s cd on sett w early would be so good for laning, even with half the dmg or less
[4:20:18] xeon77x: if the shield stays sgrong tho
[4:20:21] xeon77x: strong*

[4:25:02] kawking0801: yes
[4:25:06] amiro2000: YEP
[4:25:42] amiro2000: now i can see why tyler1 hate yorick
[4:26:08] ruhtrast1: Sett is a champion only if you play him like warwick. if you know his limit and know how to exceed it
[4:26:39] ruhtrast1: actually for me he is like that
[4:28:04] amiro2000: every champion that have mobility beat sett even garen
[4:28:09] ruhtrast1: sett just need a buff of ms in his Q spell in every direction for me
[4:28:32] ruhtrast1: and maybe more health regen
[4:28:36] xeon77x: ez money
[4:28:55] amiro2000: @ruhtrast1 he need buff on his like garen q
[4:29:22] kawking0801: New Combo: Flash + Ignite LUL
[4:29:57] ruhtrast1: @amiro2000 clearly yes and maybe more scaling ad or hp on his capacity
[4:30:58] Kleptow25: Sett has a decent winrate atm but yeah just a small buff might be needed for him to perform well at higher elo. Still some folks succeed in making him work
[4:31:58] Kleptow25: I mean, in previous patches he was weaker iirc
[4:32:08] thanahtos: yo GIGACHAD we getting winners que now
[4:32:10] kawking0801: @Kleptow25 True
[4:32:19] amiro2000: 48% W/R he have the same as aatrox KEKW
[4:32:41] ruhtrast1: but...no really he has damage but what he don t actually have is mobility

[4:33:10] Kleptow25: I check at emerald+ elo, if you look at master + yh he is like 49%
[4:34:31] ruhtrast1: concretely sett is actually weak his winrate don t show how weak he is but clearly he is understated compared to other toplaner....
[4:35:05] amiro2000: karthus is mad KEKW
[4:36:27] amiro2000: he tp for taking towers later on and ignite idk KEKW
[4:36:31] heyitscrims: He thought he was mid but akali wanted trade after she saw sett xd

[4:39:44] kawking0801: Yorick Hullbreaker?
[4:39:46] amiro2000: the crazy thing is the xaio guy is playing with sett so good that he made him looks strong
[4:40:47] ruhtrast1: Oh yeah and why not to give sett more MR scaling ??? XDDD
[4:41:07] comeonconman: Splt push Sett
[4:41:22] JohnBakerz: thye nerfed setss regain
[4:41:41] ruhtrast1: better to give him back his regen i think @AutolykusLoL

[7:55:40] RiptidexRiltreks: if aatrox was objectively unfair @shabladuub
[7:55:44] Silver9fang99: riven is super mobile, has no CDs, CC, waveclear, and can outdual most champs
[7:55:44] RiptidexRiltreks: AKA ANIMATION CANCELS
[7:56:01] Silver9fang99: if riven is behind she just doesn't fight and farms
[7:56:22] RiptidexRiltreks: riven has built in mini sheen. she can proxy like no tomorrow
[7:56:30] RiptidexRiltreks: idk why we haven't seen perma proxy riven players yet
[7:56:49] Silver9fang99: cause most riven players want to just fight
[7:56:55] gitcat: fuckkk riven

I would love to tell him every night “I love you” and rub his feet while he streams. We would go out when he isn’t doing gamer stuff and have fun together. He is also great at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own BF. I love boys who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date him.
[8:47:11] floydflaming0: @Nightbot HUH

[8:58:21] Nightbot: I want to date Auto so bad. He is so cute and I love him so much. He has a cute smile and a cute face. He’s a gamer like me and has a amazing personality. I would love to tell him every night “I love you” and rub his feet while he streams. We would go out when he isn’t doing gamer stuff and have fun together. He is also great at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own BF. I love boys who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date him.
