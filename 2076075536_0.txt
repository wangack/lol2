[2:41:53] eliotxshadowfrost21: gotta love the american health system. went to the dentist 2 weeks ago for a cleaning and they are like oh your gonna need a root canal let us refer you to an endodontist. just went in for the eval of the endodontist and had to pay 300 for them to within 20 minutes look at it say yup needs a root canal schedule an appointment for it, its gonna cost you 1400. so i literally paid 300 dollars to have someone tell me something i already knew like wtf?
[2:42:01] koolaidking456: he’s pretty decent on Aatrox
[2:42:05] morbidnumbskull: You dont, coz ur behind.. AP twitch relies on early lead
[2:42:16] RaiohKyros: what is this essay wtf
[2:42:55] Praetor_GG: @eliotxshadowfrost21 that's not specific to America, nothing is free anywhere

[2:43:37] raiden104: Private insurance is morally reprehensible when there is not a public option
[2:43:56] koolaidking456: never heard of that must be a liberal California policy
[2:44:15] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Praetor_GG well i get that you pay for being served but why in the actual hell should it cost 300 dollars individually that isnt even applied to the procedure? that makes no sense.
[2:44:27] Praetor_GG: the government cannot subvert supply and demand, physically impossible
[2:44:30] eliotxshadowfrost21: and evaluations generally arent covered by insurance which is fucked too
[2:44:46] Jakmo: This Ezreal is doing work
[2:44:54] Praetor_GG: @eliotxshadowfrost21 because they can, healthcare industry does what they want they have infinite money
[2:45:21] raiden104: Profit motive + people's health outcomes = unethical behavior every single time
[2:45:46] Praetor_GG: all the industries we've been funnelling money into are massive now and have no accountability to us - healthcare, education, banking, IT, etc.
[2:46:00] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Praetor_GG i mean you arent wrong. ive heard so many storied of people who just didnt pay what they owed for medical bills and the hospital just writes it off on their taxes and doesnt have to pay taxes. super scummy

[3:54:13] koushik_10: i dont understand is it really hard to understand the concept of getting objectives and choke enemy team and win the game ? instead of fighting for no reason and throwing the whole lead i see  alot of players doing this

[4:03:52] Wildcobra_: its okay, last game you had 3 winning lanes into them winning. this game they have winning 3, you'll win :)
[4:04:08] NightShado81: Ngl i hate watching jgl in pro play but I think it's fine in solo
[4:04:17] Praetor_GG: based
[4:04:23] Doggers_: when my laners actually listen to my macro gachiGASM
[4:04:33] NightShado81: But if the best of the best can only exist to give gold to their laners it's feels bad
[4:04:41] mst_thetrollone: @santorin you really think grubs are worth? i can only see it for jg lv but overall they feel useless vs a dragon or no?
[4:04:54] hey_im_rabid: it really is funny how much laners dont understand jungle LUL
[4:05:01] Rodacon: @NightShado81 I prefer that to 2020/21 full clear meta though
[4:05:03] NightShado81: Or cc adcs in late game
[4:05:16] Levo311: hes just yelling junglediff in caps repeatedly
[4:05:22] iYogert: laners never look at their junglers condition just their lane state
[4:05:24] worldparadise420: did u or any of your former teammates had stage nervousness during pro plays ?
[4:05:39] bot1nant: !opgg

[4:07:31] Praetor_GG: KEKW
[4:07:47] solidussovis: rift maker first?
[4:07:48] Jakmo: I feel like one of the few who doesn't get nervous anymore is Faker. (for crowds not results)
[4:07:51] worldparadise420: I feel bad for Korean export players who dont speak english and have  stage fears ?
[4:07:54] GreenyFeeny: can you show your
[4:07:55] GreenyFeeny: AD
[4:08:00] GreenyFeeny: and ap levels?
[4:08:30] mst_thetrollone: @santorin do you think riot fukd the lather by adding emerald and moving diamond hardstucks to masters-chall and silver/gold to emerald diamond? the whole lather full of trash players or elo boosted. literally all games are unplayable and always one sided 100%
[4:09:07] Rodacon: @mst_thetrollone The league/division isn't the important part, it's the MMR
[4:09:16] Praetor_GG: masters does look so bad now and emerald is all over the place it's true
[4:09:20] Rodacon: Arbitrarily changing the divisions won't affect MMR
[4:09:24] Whitizi: mst_thetrollone not nitpicking but just wanted to let you know its "ladder" lather is to like. cover yourself in soap. lather yourself in soap
[4:09:41] Falcnation: huehuehue online
[4:10:02] Rodacon: Wow, that is a bit extreme LUL
[4:10:28] worldparadise420: Your Mord jg is insane? u played it before ?
[4:10:45] Praetor_GG: challenger should be 100 people at most
[4:11:09] zteixeira: there is no limit for master
[4:11:37] Jakmo: the edition of the emerald tier wasn't the problem with the ladder
[4:11:58] Jakmo: addition*
[4:11:59] Praetor_GG: the problem was always the same but it gets worse and worse because they don't address it
[4:12:15] Praetor_GG: same thing happened to HotS but they killed the game before it got this bad
[4:12:22] Dreamwaltzer: do you still play on secret accounts
[4:12:25] Zady: Good afternoon Lucas!
[4:12:42] Rodacon: Is Shaco fundamentally incompatible with pro play because communication destroys his strengths, or is he just too bad as a champ?
[4:12:45] Falcnation: emerald helped for d4 but d4 is still too saturated, i remember when d4 was top 1% and now its not even top 3%
[4:13:32] Melquiiiway: @Santorin I've been challenger twice as support on 2020, 2021, and chal as jungle on 22. Now I want to transition and also aim for hitting chal for either mid or top but I'm currently struggling. Do you have any tips for me?
[4:13:49] Rodacon: It took me a while to realise how he got away LUL
[4:14:24] odolofonos1: @melquiiiway who are you , Tyler 1?
[4:14:46] Falcnation: rylais 3rd item?
[4:14:50] Melquiiiway: @odolofonos1 T1 wannabe bro but currently hardstuck D2/1
[4:14:51] Praetor_GG: CS and wave management are huge, take time to learn
[4:15:12] odolofonos1: @melquiiiway opdotgg ?
[4:15:25] Virbello: neeko mid so you can keep playmaking, really strong laner too
[4:16:41] HarliiQuiinn: Big Daddy Morde is down?!? WutFace
[4:17:20] imLogiiC301: @Santorin would you rather have an autistic son top laner or an uwu daughter support ?
[4:17:37] lewhitehd69: gwen outplayed OMEGALUL
[4:17:43] DuckieFried: @Rodacon pros know exactly how to punish shaco, he has to get ahead early or hes basically useless and pros know how to make him useless
[4:17:56] bbk15: that’s why I play mid as my off role, play for jg
[4:18:11] Levo311: @imLogiiC301 my autistic 6 yr old plays top, and is a higher rank than me lol
[4:18:13] Konihan: What do you gain when you kill someone inside Mordes ult¿
[4:18:42] Whitizi: E G OMEGALUL
[4:18:43] Jakmo: it annoys me a lot when I sneak into pits for drakes/herald and laners alert the enemy
[4:18:47] solidussovis: 8-1 and your being jungle gapped?
[4:19:09] odolofonos1: main character syndrome is real for AA troxx
[4:19:14] jzipfel20: Gotta listen to daddy Morde!!
[4:19:45] mst_thetrollone: @santorin i think he still recovering from solo loosing lane but at the same time another lather boosted ape.
[4:20:10] PigeonSenti: did we win the twitch game?
[4:20:15] worldparadise420: When u play wukong jg, please show how to play like a pro ?
[4:20:16] Falcnation: nah you goated that by early smiting so she could pick it up
[4:20:27] Falcnation: jk he smited
[4:20:53] NightShado81: @santorin wb spirit visage or rockern
[4:20:58] Whitizi: what if you go unending despair
[4:21:04] worldparadise420: oh ok
[4:21:13] NightShado81: @santorin how do you keep up your income mid game as a khazix or rengar I really struggle with hovering and keeping farm...
[4:21:42] darkkkona: you were teammate with impact, right ?
[4:21:53] blast777: spirit visage would be awesome here
[4:22:57] solidussovis: banshee?

[4:25:07] NightShado81: Or did I miss it

[4:27:04] iYogert: force of nature next?
[4:27:10] SixtySevenWest: why no Rylais?
[4:27:21] kingbullet: It always sucks when you don't get a good suck off.
[4:27:39] holytoby: Top lane isnt for good times; top lane is because we hate ourslves.
[4:27:40] NightShado81: They are all short range

[4:33:25] blast777: it always sucks losing a game like that, it always does, you can never monk your way out of this feeling.
[4:33:34] eliotxshadowfrost21: 13/4 gwen and 12/4 swain is a tough thing to deal with
[4:33:55] getsometalentloser: how did aatrox mange to lose to gwen in lane

[4:36:56] blast777: always go revitalize on darius, is amazing with triumph and Q with last stand.
[4:36:56] motorboater2: I think being able to ping what you want your team to do should be allowed. But god forbid we have any form of comms in game.
[4:37:16] lewhitehd69: wideVIBE
[4:37:33] rvend: @fknchillbrodamn voice chat would solve this problem but riot didnt trust their players enough
[4:37:38] rvend: 😂😂😂
[4:38:00] motorboater2: @rvend yeah i agree. Even though Riot makes Valorant which has in game voice chat. I dont get it
[4:38:10] rvend: in high elo dota games, they always use voice chat even with broken english
[4:38:27] solidussovis: My friends and I wrote theme music for Darius. That is a scary champ when he comes marching down lane after you.
[4:38:33] rvend: @fknchillbrodamn 😂

[4:39:52] NightShado81: Q for raptors start
[4:39:58] blast777: this [Party] pinging is one very bad change, would be nice to click Teleport or Rs of your teamates, remove the "alive" ping and it would be better overall
[4:40:39] tom_longEnecker: the fact that you can’t ping Nocturne or Karthus R is craaaaazy
[4:41:07] blast777: yeah the E cast wins or loses the 1v1 with heca imho, very good point made.
[4:41:32] nwa4lifeTV: it is
[4:41:35] Owlcopwn: i am addicted to zyra clear tbh

[4:43:07] rvend: i read that in tiltproof voice 😂
[4:43:15] NightShado81: Darius has one of the fastest clears
[4:43:17] blast777: @rvend I think the dmca thing has settled to where streamers can play copyrighted music but not have it in their vods so others can replay the music. I think twitch has broadcasting rights for songs.
[4:43:50] rvend: @blast777 twitch automatically remove the music in VODs? cool technology tbh
[4:44:08] nwa4lifeTV: @rvend they use shazzam Kappa
[4:44:40] blast777: @rvend I think streamers should have to have an option or smth enabled but yeah just so happens my brother is working for a company that sells an algorithm to automatically detect songs in other media.
[4:44:49] Owlcopwn: monkaW
[4:44:52] rvend: oh, cool2
[4:45:10] solidussovis: is bard the aatrox from last game? his play style seems similar
[4:45:32] Praetor_GG: @rvend that's not possible without destroying the audio quality
[4:45:50] Praetor_GG: the audio is just split so it's not recorded in the VoD
[4:46:04] rvend: ooooohhh that make more sense
[4:46:06] rvend: thanks bro
[4:46:10] zteixeira: love this song
[4:46:29] solidussovis: so losers que is real
[4:46:40] blast777: It's up to the streamer to split the audio tho from the broadcasting software, it doesn't happena utomatically
[4:46:52] Praetor_GG: correct @blast777
[4:47:02] rvend: i see2, i thought twitch automatically split the audio
[4:47:05] spectreOO8: Santo I need you to get a song on your play list caled left hand free lido remix
[4:47:06] rvend: thx guys
[4:47:57] rvend: why he ghost? can you chase him if hes not ghosting?
[4:48:12] blast777: and twitch is allowed indeed to broadcast copyright music otherwise most streamers would be banned. Even if the streamer doesn't split the audio, the algorithms detect the songs and auto mute the VoD where the copyrighted material is played.
[4:48:20] Praetor_GG: every time FailFish
[4:48:41] rvend: @blast777 ah got it
[4:48:45] mst_thetrollone: @santorin this game so bad i do like you doing.1st time anything, it doesn’t matter the game matchmaking a nightmare 😂. i hit autofill and yasuo as bot still win hard lose the game. i mean i could play win any lane and still have 4 losers.
[4:48:48] NightShado81: Enjoy slowing the heca now xds
[4:48:55] Praetor_GG: @blast777 yeah similar to YouTube detecting copyright material and demonitizing
[4:49:10] blast777: yes ^
[4:49:30] rvend: SeemsGood
[4:49:34] Melquiiiway: yes
[4:49:49] stoicHolcan: !
[4:49:50] worldparadise420: did u play olaf jg ? or yet to play ?
[4:50:06] stoicHolcan: he was too excited to fist bump you to think about hecarim
[4:50:10] rvend: HOLYYYY
[4:50:10] dkvukster: xdd
[4:50:17] Owlcopwn: I wouldnt say that now KEKW
[4:50:40] Owlcopwn: no I mean didnt he get benched for being a rude dude
[4:50:42] Owlcopwn: xdd
[4:50:47] dkvukster: its very good haha
[4:50:51] Melquiiiway: one more lane death to Irelia and i'm sure she'd run it down
[4:51:00] solidussovis: Who doesn't get excited to fist bump especially when its a Santorin first bump
[4:51:04] Owlcopwn: so be more rude, swear at us
[4:51:11] Praetor_GG: Adam BigBrother
[4:51:11] WhiteLift: Good morning Santorin!
[4:51:35] rvend: dont jinx it my goat
[4:52:32] motorboater2: this looks like a new champo in the pool on the main acc
[4:52:40] dkvukster: im trying to learn jungle - i always been toplaner.. i dont get why enemy jg now twice have had a cs lead on me xdd i take scuttles and all
[4:53:30] dkvukster: ahh gotcha ty
[4:53:47] Jakmo: cs also isn't calculated 1 to 1 so it can look like you're ahead/behind when you're not
[4:53:50] rvend: ah nice info mr santorin
[4:54:12] NightShado81: You jinxed it
[4:54:15] NightShado81: Bruh
[4:54:48] WhiteLift: Fiddlesticks in LCK last night and it won. Proves its a top tier jungler Santorin
[4:55:27] Owlcopwn: 95 stacks at 18 minutes
[4:55:29] Owlcopwn: uhh
[4:55:41] motorboater2: kayle wincon
[4:55:46] Jakmo: can't open with E against Kat D:
[4:55:49] Dreamwaltzer: something something jinxed it
[4:55:53] stoicHolcan: casual 1200 gold for irelia ThisIsFine
[4:56:24] NightShado81: Isn't frozen heart Omega this game?
[4:56:34] cycle_sisters: was morde a dub?
[4:57:06] rvend: aatrox playing different game sir
[4:57:20] Praetor_GG: this game has never been more like HotS where a bad teammate just counters you no matter how far ahead you are
[4:57:24] rvend: NICEEEEE
[4:57:32] rvend: THATS MY GOAT
[4:57:39] NightShado81: Darius moment
[4:57:43] NightShado81: allyooOk
[4:57:57] Praetor_GG: GIGACHAD
[4:58:08] stoicHolcan: i cannot believe they buffed darius
[4:58:23] nwa4lifeTV: hots is a 4 fun game
[4:58:28] blast777: @stoicHolcan ?
[4:58:40] AyeItsAyJay: HoTS is blizzard's MOBA right?
[4:58:49] Nyanra: y
[4:58:51] blast777: @AyeItsAyJay aye
[4:58:57] nwa4lifeTV: which blizzard killed
[4:59:09] Praetor_GG: @nwa4lifeTV a lot of hardstuck gold players think that ok
[4:59:17] Jakmo: Blizzard is dead itself so it shouldn't be surprising
[4:59:18] NightShado81: @santorin black cleaver is really good on darius
[4:59:23] NightShado81: Cuz it gives perma ms
[4:59:25] nautowar43: baited
[4:59:26] NightShado81: And pen
[4:59:30] Nyanra: Deadass
[4:59:32] rvend: if enemy team has huge healing, outheal them dont buy anti heal LUL
[4:59:41] koushik_10: XD
[4:59:48] koushik_10: nice dance
[5:00:01] Nyanra: Hecarims name tho
[5:00:47] mst_thetrollone: @santorin plan a: wait for kayle to take inhib and push baron orrrr plan b: run it down and let kayle die.
[5:01:03] blast777: wait I didnt know that tech with the Krugs! :O
[5:01:10] AyeItsAyJay: Blizzard's moba was fun for a little while, just didn't feel competitive so I stopped
[5:01:17] AyeItsAyJay: @Praetor_GG did you go all out in it or something?
[5:01:39] Praetor_GG: competitive is a mentality
[5:01:44] rvend: @ayeitsayjay heroes of newerth?
[5:02:10] AyeItsAyJay: @rvend that game still exists?
[5:02:15] blast777: @rvend Heroes of the Storm not Heroes of Newerth
[5:02:17] stoicHolcan: 3 bots and kayle
[5:02:22] stoicHolcan: confirmed
[5:02:25] rvend: 😂
[5:02:26] blast777: no HoN shut down like 2-3 years ago
[5:02:28] rvend: wrong game
[5:02:30] Owlcopwn: surely it cant be bad
[5:03:14] Jakmo: Heroes of the Storm still exists? I thought it died 4 years ago
[5:03:24] Praetor_GG: it did
[5:03:32] Owlcopwn: smh my head
[5:03:34] blast777: @Jakmo it does but no new champs, just maintenance
[5:03:38] Praetor_GG: but not like HoN there are still players just no scene
[5:03:47] rvend: @blast777 zombie state, sadge
[5:03:48] jetabel001: lol you wanna fight
[5:03:57] yeyaX: “or I did anything different “ LMAOOO
[5:04:03] Nyanra: you were creating space honestly
[5:04:13] AyeItsAyJay: I think they just implemented to much RNG into their moba for it to be competitive, maybe that's just me though
[5:04:16] blast777: @rvend At least its available! And in Europe the Qs are quite short ot be honest
[5:04:28] rvend: oh interesting
[5:04:33] Praetor_GG: @AyeItsAyJay yeah that's just you, game does not even have crit
[5:05:03] AyeItsAyJay: they literally put league arena type mini games into their main game lmao
[5:05:03] rvend: kayke jungle Kappa
[5:05:06] Praetor_GG: just more about mechanics and teamfight so most laning skill doesn't translate, League players cope instead of adapting
[5:05:09] rvend: kayle*
[5:05:21] Praetor_GG: @AyeItsAyJay wdym
[5:05:41] rvend: now now now guys dont fight
[5:06:29] AyeItsAyJay: maybe that was just around beta when I was going hard on it but I remember stipulations like league's arena mode
[5:06:35] blast777: The heroes in HotS and the abilities and stuff were so good. I just didnt like the engine, sc2 engine way too clunky and not as responsive for 2016 or whenever it came out.
[5:06:57] Praetor_GG: @AyeItsAyJay I guess you mean map objectives? if you only played during beta, game changed massively over time
[5:07:23] g1oomey: it's midalee
[5:07:26] tala____: Mid nid? what is this season 3?
[5:07:27] Praetor_GG: @blast777 that is very true, SC2 engine was garbo for the format
[5:07:28] blast777: they had a monk melee healer, that had some lee sin mechanics too, the heroes were amazing
[5:07:47] AyeItsAyJay: AyeItsAyJay subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! rarely get to watch b/c of my work schedule but I gotta toss this to the best jungler NA
[5:07:54] Praetor_GG: only MOBA with a 2-player character that shit was great
[5:08:03] Tritros: still play hots with my friends every once in a while
[5:08:08] blast777: yeah man!
[5:08:31] blast777: HotS had the most creative and unique champions out of all mobas (Ive played them all :P)
[5:08:43] Praetor_GG: yeah they don't get enough credit for that
[5:08:47] AyeItsAyJay: ty ty, got myself a lil viking helmet now, leggo
[5:08:57] koushik_10: bro the icecream parlour i order from was closed so i order from diff one for more price than usual and now i regret wasting my money sad
[5:09:10] Praetor_GG: there is no yuumi in HotS, they have Abathur, way more interesting design and high skillcap
[5:09:23] Praetor_GG: although toxic xdd
[5:09:24] AyeItsAyJay: @Praetor_GG maybe I'll check out how hit is now, I did judge a game off it's beta, not smart
[5:09:37] blast777: Paragon respawned, Gigantic respawned, I wish HotS would respawn too. Reeincarnate into smth a little more polished.
[5:09:54] Praetor_GG: @AyeItsAyJay it's cool man, but I wouldn't blame you for no longer being interested since not having a pro scene *does* make the game less competitive
[5:10:01] Rodacon: I always found it a bit funny to watch Abathur crawl out of his little home on SC2
[5:10:24] Praetor_GG: Aba was perma ban in pro that shit was messed up xdd
[5:11:45] CrimeSkeleton: wp
[5:11:52] generalk1w1: taric goat
[5:11:57] Rodacon: Huh, I always assumed this song was by Imagine Dragons
[5:11:59] blast777: idk how successful the new Paragon game will be but I liked that epic sold away the IP since they coiuldnt make it work (cause of Fortnite success) I hoped Blizz could do smth like that but I dont think so cause Blizzard games all are connected with each toher u cant just sell one game.
[5:12:34] Rodacon: Sadly the legendary Blizzard RTS team is dead at this point
[5:12:40] Nyanra: for some reason, your Sejuani is so icon to me
[5:13:15] Rodacon: We'll see if Stormgate/Frost Giant can recreate the magic given that a bunch moved over to there
[5:13:36] blast777: overwatch would have the same fate, if they didnt create a seperate engine from the ground up for the new game. They tried to cheapskate it with HotS and used a 20 year engine, didn't work.
[5:13:57] Rodacon: SC2's engine was not 20 years old?
[5:14:34] koushik_10: would ever like to coach a team in league if the opportunity comes?
[5:14:55] Praetor_GG: although Overwatch had a whole different problem of spending way too much money to force a pro scene and now you have to remove 2 players from every match and have bronze players perma typing at you, ded gaem
[5:15:18] blast777: @Rodacon You are right, wasnt as old as I thought.
[5:15:26] Praetor_GG: I loved OW in the beta and it was all downhill from there, game was super fun when everyone was bad
[5:15:35] Praetor_GG: never will play it again
[5:16:22] mst_thetrollone: @santorin is it better to countergank or just gank opposite sides as long apemates dont int?
[5:16:40] rvend: how to remove the adrenaline rush? like when i am super focused on the game i got like surge of adrenaline and i start to be fidgety and miss my skill.
[5:16:54] rvend: and sometimes miss my smite
[5:16:57] mortinside14: !opgg
[5:16:57] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Santorini%20Panini-EUW & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/SantariniPanini-JGDIF & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ChatDisabler97-MUTE
[5:16:57] 0ki1721: coach from home like work from home lol
[5:17:12] Praetor_GG: @rvend I have same problem my hands shake really bad when I get even a little excited NotLikeThis
[5:17:22] rvend: bro @praetor_gg 😭😭😭
[5:17:57] rvend: and the play didnt work out
[5:18:10] blast777: Overwatch was such a Blizzard quality game, so smooth, last game of that patented blizzard quality
[5:18:20] cjcunn506: what was your favorite team you’ve played for? do you have a favorite player you played with?
[5:18:30] Praetor_GG: @blast777 yeah the engine was super well optimized
[5:18:49] koushik_10: u should have joined a team just to support or as an analyst to still be in the scene
[5:18:50] blast777: @Praetor_GG it just feels so good
[5:19:31] rvend: ah i see, i might stop drinking energy drink
[5:19:38] rvend: okay thanks my goat
[5:19:41] hey_im_rabid: I drink coffee literally all day working in an office ruined me
[5:19:45] mst_thetrollone: @santorin i got caffeine poisoning once. i shit non stop for 2 weeks
[5:19:45] masoquequeisso: Oyy playing sej? She is so cool!
[5:20:04] mst_thetrollone: i poop sommuch it was clear
[5:20:17] rvend: HUHHHH 😭😭😭
[5:20:24] kroxxen1: How we been Santorin?
[5:20:26] blast777: Yeah with high intakes of caffeine u need the right amount of theanine not to be shaky or taurine, the one Monster uses.
[5:20:38] kroxxen1: Do you miss pro play at all?
[5:21:09] DJ_Photik: Energy drinks give me canker sores 😢
[5:21:28] 0ki1721: b12 vitamins give nice focus
[5:21:43] Praetor_GG: energy drinks are very unhealthy I limit them to only when I need to focus on a specific task for hours
[5:21:46] GhostxxHorse: no truer words spoken. there is no sleep as a parent.
[5:21:50] yeyaX: the headaches after using caffeine is so baaad too
[5:21:54] blast777: @dj_photik You are lucky in your missfortune, cause we don't know the extent of which they impact our health yet.
[5:21:58] MrHattyboy: being irish we drink a lot of tea, which has enough caffine for me
[5:22:06] Praetor_GG: @0ki1721 that's where most energy drinks get their "energy"
[5:22:16] rvend: @yeyax what source of caffeine you got?
[5:22:17] GhostxxHorse: voli a little tanky
[5:22:26] sebastianminiatures: I can't remember the last time I got a full 8 hours unless I was giga sick
[5:22:35] rvend: for me, i got headache sometimes from coffew but not energy drink and tea idk how
[5:22:54] VanSkittles: !rank
[5:23:14] yeyaX: I mean like after drinking for a while and stopping.. like the withdrawals are so bad
[5:23:15] Praetor_GG: if you take a B vitamin with B12 you can get that boost an energy drink gives you w/o the caffeine
[5:23:31] rvend: ah i see, i never got caffine withdrawal idk how 😭
[5:23:32] DJ_Photik: @yeyax not hydrated enough? Water? Or withdrawals
[5:23:35] FluffyMuffin96: santorinWave santorinWave
[5:23:36] yeyaX: energy drinks just make me shake lmaooo
[5:23:52] yeyaX: I drink only water thooo there’s no way I’m dehydrated
[5:23:57] Frost212: I haven't had a drink with caffeine in it in.....12 years?
[5:24:04] Praetor_GG: also you need to drink more water after energy drinks, similar to alcohol they dehydrate you
[5:24:09] DJ_Photik: Is your piss clear
[5:24:22] yeyaX: @praetor_gg I need to try because I get so tired
[5:24:30] Nyanra: nida mid is a thing now? monkaHmm
[5:24:38] blast777: Was drinking 2 Monster energy drinks a day, cut cold turkey, had the most miserable 3-4 days of my life until I started drinking it again. Im caffeine free lately tho but didnt do it cold turkey.
[5:24:41] hey_im_rabid: rip smolder
[5:25:04] rvend: @blast777 playing with death are we 😭
[5:25:32] Praetor_GG: @blast777 I have known caffeine addicts, it's underrated how physically addictive it is, good for you cutting back ok
[5:25:40] blast777: @rvend I could never have imagined how strong caffeine addiction was.
[5:25:48] moppin_de_ting_yeh: what do you think the reason of jungle being the least popular role even less than support.
[5:26:03] Nyanra: oh
[5:26:14] hey_im_rabid: @blast777 cutting out caffeine is no joke the only thing worse is cutting out aspartame
[5:26:36] rvend: @hey_im_rabid how come cuttig out aspartame bad?
[5:26:52] koushik_10: ur on tank and u have smolder if she plays good after stacks and u play for her this should be a dub
[5:26:53] koushik_10: tbh
[5:26:57] blast777: @Praetor_GG definitely caught me off guard, but I would like to drink 3 cups of tea or filtered coffee per day as those people were found to live longer than non drinkers
[5:27:04] blast777: @Praetor_GG decaf or not
[5:27:14] hey_im_rabid: @rvend its waaaaaaaaaay more addictive than caffeine thats why diet coke is so popular
[5:27:47] Praetor_GG: Hmm tea seems very safe in general, humans been drinking it a lot longer
[5:27:47] blast777: @hey_im_rabid Yeah, I was surprised, it destroyed me, I was like "nah lets drink some caffeine" It was like flu symptoms on steroids. crazy experience.
[5:27:56] rvend: really? i honestly dont know that is addictive i like it because its 0 calories
[5:28:00] rvend: 😂😂😂
[5:28:37] hey_im_rabid: ha yep its the artificial sweetener that gets you
[5:28:56] rvend: ah i see, i will cut out aspartame too then
[5:29:27] blast777: @rvend You may want to try stevia cola, see if the flavor suits you, if you have to drink cola that is.
[5:29:29] 0ki1721: PENTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[5:29:44] koushik_10: and the song
[5:29:49] rvend: niceeee
[5:29:51] moppin_de_ting_yeh: I hate the fact that smolder steals every kill with his execute its so annoying
[5:29:51] Ray701: xddSmolder
[5:29:55] koushik_10: i liked this song so much i added it to my songs
[5:30:03] blast777: pentaexecute
[5:30:14] rvend: i am not from NA and europe so it might not available to me
[5:30:18] Praetor_GG: @blast777 sucralose is a good sweetener if if doesn't cause you problem, I'm allergic to it or something
[5:30:36] 0ki1721: Yea after 224 stacks
[5:30:46] blast777: @Praetor_GG Really? I've heard the worst about sucralose, must look it up again.
[5:31:01] Praetor_GG: I mean idk how healthy it is, just that it tastes decent
[5:31:15] Praetor_GG: I literally can't eat it or I suffer majorly
[5:31:21] moppin_de_ting_yeh: @0ki1721 like sometimes you try to be the carry and you do most dmg but he just steals every kill u wroked for and takes the spothlight lmao, very selfish champion
[5:31:36] iiNumb3rz: He really picked sejuani lol. Dude ls about to un retire. He misses it.
[5:31:45] koushik_10: they were fighting the voli a@
[5:31:48] koushik_10: @Santorin
[5:31:50] rvend: @moppin_de_ting_yeh i mean if we are winning i dont mind, but imho anyway
[5:32:02] hazygreys: which one is shirley
[5:32:03] 0ki1721: @rvend same
[5:32:10] 0ki1721: who cares about ego if you're winning
[5:32:36] hazygreys: smolder online
[5:32:56] iiNumb3rz: Does nidalle count as melee?
[5:33:03] joyomendez: I hate when my team aces them without me makes me feel useless
[5:33:17] rvend: do you have the list of the champion that not have been played in jg?
[5:33:22] TwistedToughts: can you show what runes is the smolder using?
[5:34:00] yeyaX: could you play briar pretty pleaseeee I want to see how you play her

[5:35:25] jesselgm: How many more games do you think you can do feasibly?
[5:35:26] CrimeSkeleton: only true metric of viability
[5:35:28] rvend: HAHAHAHAHAH
[5:35:35] rvend: i agree
[5:35:39] CeremonD: nasus jungle please !
[5:35:45] TwistedToughts: is it possible to see what runes was smolder using? @Santorin

[5:35:50] Velraptured: Teemo
[5:35:52] blast777: red + bad kda = champ suck
[5:35:57] SilverSurferIsRadd: Shurelyas on Skarner might have been the worst
[5:36:25] TwistedToughts: ty kind sir! @Santorin
[5:36:33] blast777: I wonder why they still havent made Renekton a jungler yet (Q dmg on jungle minions)
[5:36:39] jesselgm: have you done trynd yet

[6:03:53] rvend: sink cost fallacy by the enemy team
[6:04:07] iiNumb3rz: Just think. Somebody in a office at Rito headquarters decided it was OK to unleash that champ

[6:08:36] tugwos: @Falcnation playing every viable jungle champ one time

[6:10:39] iiNumb3rz: I did get a firm warning though
[6:10:45] Rhijn: @iiNumb3rz and got instantly timed out
[6:10:47] iiNumb3rz: @falcnation it's random

[6:11:38] iiNumb3rz: Op says I'm like a top 2% bel veth player but hard stuck in gold
[6:11:41] SilverSurferIsRadd: flash + R onto Smolder and just hope that Ksante can chain against them for ashe to do dmg
[6:11:51] iiNumb3rz: So I'm not entirely sure how much I trust that lol
[6:11:55] Tristiiano: two split pushers op
[6:12:18] nwa4lifeTV: getting smoldered
[6:12:24] Praetor_GG: @iiNumb3rz if you play 800 games you'll be chally like every other belveth otp xdd

[6:12:56] moppin_de_ting_yeh: ksante is such a piss useless champ lmao
[6:13:06] iiNumb3rz: @praetor_gg if I hit challenger I'll put it on my resume.
[6:13:12] BroHavenManor: At least the perma split pushing vayne is up in levels right? Right?
[6:13:20] Falcnation: this ksante is useless, ksante played well is broken af
[6:13:36] moppin_de_ting_yeh: @Falcnation not after last patch smart boi
[6:13:42] Praetor_GG: @iiNumb3rz "any special talents?" xdd
[6:13:51] Falcnation: they balanced his kit didnt nerf it
[6:13:57] iiNumb3rz: There is a better chance of santorin losing enough games In a row to get to bronze than I do of ever hitting challenger.
[6:13:58] RifleEU: I Think i cant improve folks, reached d1 once and stuck between d3-2 since for a few yrs maybe i should quit
[6:14:23] iiNumb3rz: If you are enjoying yourself then don't quit

[6:14:48] Falcnation: enjoying yourself playing league? KEKW
[6:14:52] Tristiiano: @rifleeu how about some coaching?
[6:14:59] Praetor_GG: yeah hardest lesson about League is that rank doesn't matter and the whole point of playing is to enjoy what you're doing and have a competitive game
