[0:14:19] Hymuno: its being put out in different regions first
[0:14:31] Napping_Sab: yes it's already on i have riot vanguard in my PC
[0:14:33] Shangoshi: vanguard is the worst piece of shit in existence, zero optimazation
[0:14:55] Shangoshi: it's heavier on my system than 90% of games on the market
[0:15:02] Hymuno: if you play valo then vanguard is already on your pc, just not for league yet
[0:15:05] Toraxini: @KayPea Idk why thwy buffing vex she is already strong
[0:15:16] JustCaptainMimmy: the next patch they will add Vangruard for League
[0:15:30] Hymuno: i hate vanguard, nearly bricked my pc trying to enable it in bios settings
[0:15:37] Casyo99: buff vex? she is already strong
[0:16:16] Armor87: guess I'll drop 600 on a mac mini so I can play league without vanguard
[0:16:20] pios: Vex passive

[0:16:43] belallaj: why buff vex shes not weak, just boring
[0:16:43] ObsceneSanity: vex needs the buff though. her play rate is pretty low
[0:17:13] notclarkyyy: welcome kels where were u lols
[0:17:14] Hymuno: mac have inbuilt apple vanguard so they don't need vanguard vanguard
[0:17:15] Toraxini: @ObsceneSanity Ye but she is so easy to play and boring if i would say XD
[0:17:20] notclarkyyy: welcome back*
[0:17:23] JustCaptainMimmy: @Niomah i give you hug <3
[0:17:30] nicolasxduarte: Hi Kels kaypFlower
[0:17:50] Niomah: She went peacefully and pretty much told me she was ready to go so it is a bit easier to handle. She was a big dog and almost 14, and diabetic so the fact she lived that long is amazing. She had a great life.
[0:17:58] 96sephiroth: do you know the series trollhunters tales in arcadia? coz you look like morgana, she pretty btw hehehe

[0:28:27] CynicalScrub: @ItsAMoll not gonna lie, i could watch her play ahri all day long
[0:28:37] Jaguar542: Because she threw the recurve bow in your face, resulting in additional crit damage 4Head

[0:42:30] teamyyyyyyyyy: hi kaypea ninjaaCute
[0:42:49] ItsAMoll: i was silver 2 50 lp last week, lost like 8 games in a row and now im back to silver 4 :( so lame
[0:42:58] Hymuno: i bought a skins and some chromas now i only lose 11lp instead of 23lp Kappa
[0:42:59] Darkcyter: @SeaOfKiLLeR @teamyyyyyyyyy kaypHello kaypHello
[0:42:59] MissUnfortuneK: It's all about the winrate I think
[0:43:02] tessiebuttsie: yay puppy💤
[0:43:03] impaktfull: old mmr system Kreygasm
[0:43:09] redflare201: just go back to how it was :(
[0:43:10] jimbob_ywert: how would strict MMR work
[0:43:11] SeaOfKiLLeR: whatever you do win ratio is always around %50
[0:43:19] murkihonest: riot honestly just telling us to touch grass kaypLUL
[0:43:48] impaktfull: riot honestly just tells us to fk urselves LUL
[0:43:57] Jaguar542: in your last 100 games you have: 45 wins - 53 loses and 2 remakes
[0:44:07] ItsAMoll: do you do op.gg reviews for chatters?
[0:44:10] tessiebuttsie: riot just wants money obviously
[0:44:18] Darley001: !prediction
[0:44:54] aureliasdream: Its all just a step up anyways, its massively bs.. they make you climb up and then suddenly throw trolls and losses until you derank hmmm
[0:44:58] NyanLF: hey KayPea , just ask if u dont mind if i reach any rank there is chance to demote or like tft cant demote ?
[0:44:58] LakyLG: Hi Queen <3
[0:44:59] aureliasdream: Set up*
[0:45:01] LMAOKAI88: My win rate was 91% when I stopped playing this season
[0:45:13] murkihonest: riot be like here is your new skin now F off
[0:46:03] Darley001: Miley Cyrus told me it about the climb though :(
[0:46:14] MissUnfortuneK: I said about the win rate because in flex I have 24wins-15loses 3 in a row last night and I only got -18 -16 -18 and for a game I get +28/30
[0:46:28] jimbob_ywert: if people just focus on improving in every single game then they’ll start climbing faster. the more you focus on climbing/rank you’ll be more disappointed and demotivated
[0:46:29] mouritchou: hello <3
[0:46:57] mentalfordaayz: hey Kels good luck on the gaemms I BELIEVE!! kaypArrive kaypPengu
[0:47:05] SeaOfKiLLeR: its doesnt matter if loser queue exist
[0:47:13] Jaguar542: Soooo we are all challengers? Pog
[0:47:37] mouritchou: that's why i feel in love with tft lol at least i can't demote
[0:47:55] jexuzd: Yesterday i hoped in two normals to see if i get mood to rank, both games i got 1 afk 🥲
[0:48:16] nicetry7777: Try op
[0:48:19] Niomah: I just ARAM. If someone wants to get so ragey over an ARAM they're willing to lose their account to be "mean" to me? I find that hilarious.
[0:48:36] murkihonest: cant move my leg , my cat is sleeping on my lap HELPP kaypUpsetti
[0:49:05] redflare201: I think they excel in macro
[0:49:16] Niomah: @murkihonest I'm sorry, you're furniture now. Cat Law
[0:49:19] mouritchou: i remember that follow kled team lmao
[0:50:27] shedfirekid1: @KayPea you forgot prediction!

[0:50:51] jimbob_ywert: AYYY
[0:50:51] Hymuno: that calcualted spear dodge POGGIES
[0:50:54] lawfulevil_13: Lols
[0:51:19] jimbob_ywert: A
[0:51:28] MissUnfortuneK: That mechanics deserve to be in the challenger
[0:52:01] XRedmartyrX: they take damage from items and rune stacks into consideration
[0:52:21] Niomah: @KayPea Agreed, it's preventative and foresight instead of purely reactionary playing
[0:52:29] MissUnfortuneK: And you have all those characteristics KP so you are our challenger 👌❤️
[0:52:48] ItsAMoll: where do you learn to have good wave management, macro etc?
[0:52:52] Hymuno: im actually a challanger player but my iron team mates are just holding me back MiniK
[0:53:01] scottyjet: BCWarrior
[0:53:12] Darley001: Hey do you guys know any black pro league players?
[0:53:22] Niomah: Aphromoo?
[0:53:32] DragoonRed: @Hymuno i'm sorry for keeping you hostage in iron with me :(
[0:53:43] Niomah: He will always be the Twitch God for me
[0:53:46] S17Master: @ItsAMoll LOTS of games. It can also help to review your matches and look at the things that happened, ask yourself how you could have done x or y better
[0:53:49] Niomah: er Thresh God
[0:54:37] DragoonRed: @KayPea when you know you have people to listen to its also a lot easier to just focus on your play. I was in the broxah tournament NA and we won first. my only goal was to not feed and listen to my challenger mid and master support (I am adc)
[0:54:48] alluring_grace: Micro is from playing champ over time, Macro is having to learn the way to play the game.
[0:54:55] tacobean1: Hi Kelso!! I love you dude! Hope you have a great day
[0:55:03] redflare201: the stacks D:

[0:55:57] the_spo0n: happy to see u streaming again
[0:56:01] Hymuno: i started winning way more just by accepting i had lost lane and trying to make it as easy as possible for my team to carry me
[0:56:19] gigachadgodsu: Kelsie, do you plan on maining Syndra someday??
[0:56:27] jungl4r: play valorant
[0:56:48] the_spo0n: where is ur luxxx 😂
[0:56:49] DragoonRed: @KayPea Challenger level Mental is 100% a rarity in league these days :D

[0:59:34] ItsAMoll: @DragoonRed they nerfed AP tf lol
[0:59:46] iamtonin: kaypea and basement, today i have my final round of interviews for that supervisor position at my company
[0:59:47] DragoonRed: @ItsAMoll wait really? lol haha
[0:59:49] iamtonin: WOOOO
[1:00:02] gigachadgodsu: I have this idea that you will play on Lucas' account for one game in challenger midlane. That would be so fun.
[1:00:44] MissUnfortuneK: @iamtonin good luck with that!! 🤞
[1:01:09] nicetry7777: Good  work
[1:01:39] inadream_state: lol
[1:01:58] MrsBeebles: @iamtonin Best of luck! You'll crush it!!
[1:02:38] S17Master: For a game that updates every two weeks, it does feel like some things are left not okay for really long periods of time
[1:03:01] MayaShieda: heyyy bestiiiiiie how are the games going so far
[1:04:21] cixsmiley: well apparently tanks are weak. my take bruisers are just too strong
[1:04:56] cixsmiley: Phreak mains maokai
[1:04:57] ItsAMoll: and maokai is STILL broken
[1:05:05] LMAOKAI88: It's true they took a month to deal with me
[1:05:09] DiscordLuck: hello KP, good morning. hru _
[1:05:16] inadream_state: Mao still op
[1:05:20] XRedmartyrX: and how dare they remove something from rank play until i can be fixed
[1:05:22] inadream_state: 54 winrate
[1:05:28] Razmeck: I believe the Riot Balancing team does it for "Fun Gameplay"
[1:05:44] Niomah: And this is why junglers really need to prioritize getting grubs
[1:06:03] MayaShieda: @Razmeck that's probably what they say to themselves to cope tbh
[1:06:04] aparoid_: nothing says "fun" like a point and click root that makes you invincible
[1:06:13] jexuzd: Unless it becomes a 100% pickrate in pro play, no fixin
[1:06:17] Niomah: The grub gap is real
[1:06:22] Razmeck: Remember a last season when Morg jg was on a rampage through ranked
[1:07:07] ireallydunnoanything: BOOM 1
[1:07:10] DiscordLuck: Volibear and Karma
[1:07:14] Rogue_x0: like the smolder nerfs after the lck was crazy

[1:07:59] seanixu: I read that they Will buff Kayn, like, why kayn ?
[1:08:01] aparoid_: anything to knock the Karma abusers down a peg or 3
[1:08:16] DiscordLuck: Also, what RIOT did to Lux, basically Lux now at level 1 is like 5 abilities and you are out of mana but on the other hand Syndra has no mana loss
[1:08:33] MayaShieda: @seanixu cuz he's prettyyyy <3

[1:33:23] theLevya: then youd be playing age of empires
[1:33:31] alluring_grace: @G0ldenWing Can just use the summoner spells to have the double, and op build then it's easy to beat.
[1:33:33] ballzagna1: if this was dota and people could deny minions from you. youd care
[1:33:33] charmythelittle: kaypRiot kaypRiot kaypRiot

[1:34:08] jexuzd: A sixth player that controls minions like warcraft? Hahaha
[1:34:11] J0LLYR0GER: My buddy in silver literally gets bot accounts in his games at least 1/5 games

[1:35:21] J0LLYR0GER: You pulled off your best winion impression
[1:35:26] S17Master: @Yvernaa Still not a minion
[1:36:08] ItsAMoll: why does u.gg suggest malignance and lich bane for ahri????
[1:36:11] DiscordLuck: not the NARNIA
[1:36:25] Angelyc: @itsamoll because it's very good
[1:36:29] Angelyc: Very very good
[1:36:33] SonicSlice: malignance is busted on ahri
[1:36:35] arcadedani: can someone tell me how is that Shaco just gets away at 1hp two times! xD
[1:36:40] jimbob_ywert: Wasn’t that on Anivia?
[1:36:49] DiscordLuck: Malignance is good on Lissandra and Karma ATM
[1:36:50] Eldas_Algoris: do you know dota's cs "mecanism" where you can kill your own minions to deny enemy's cs ? Would you like it better ?
[1:36:55] S17Master: I mean.... Lucas also said Shyvana doesn't do damage
[1:36:56] theLevya: kp what would you prefer, having minions giving random gold without last hitting or having gold based on last hitting?
[1:36:57] megilino: just an ex pro lol
[1:37:11] tinyyy912: Shaco doing shaco things
[1:37:18] jimbob_ywert: probably speaking from POV of his elo
[1:37:19] Karyuu9: Lich bane is the highest damage item you can get on Ahri atm. I even go for it first.
[1:37:21] ElderFrost420: You need to build yomus/black cleaver
[1:37:29] jimbob_ywert: maligncance ahri broken in Plat-a emerald
[1:37:33] DiscordLuck: Shyvanna is going to the rework station for a reason
[1:37:40] MayaShieda: dzayumn
[1:37:42] DragoonRed: malignance is good on anyone who uses ult alot for the ult cd. and each ult use from ahri will put the poop down and with the mobility you should be able to r auto r auto lots of dmg
[1:37:42] CynicalScrub: root root dead
[1:37:43] ZoneArch: are you not supposed to build Lich first
[1:37:44] Afcb89: Hi @KayPea Good afternoon chat
[1:37:52] S17Master: That was NOT 1.84 seconds mylanta
[1:37:54] Armor87: I built a structure and donated it to a beaver. Why? Cause I give a dam.
[1:38:06] Zohrooo: stop backseating peeps
[1:38:16] TorqueBandit: @DragoonRed put the poop down????
[1:38:23] Phantomspower: hey KP, how is ahri into anivia?

[1:50:26] Angelyc: I find ludens to be ASS
[1:50:27] n1vlem: Hmm but then you get more KDA behaviour
[1:50:27] jkkzone: is ori good this patch?
[1:50:31] alluring_grace: I don't get how it's possible to lose way more than winning. I've been like 5-10 despite trying hard in all of them.
[1:50:31] theLevya: riot kaypHarmony on the next game
[1:50:31] iamtonin: i think thats why i like valorant mmr system a little better. performance is accounted for even if loss
[1:50:33] Afcb89: is that what they are actually planning with LP ?
[1:50:38] arcadedani: and remember there is something we didnt saw BRO! xD
[1:50:44] DragoonRed: Didnt they just announce they changed the LP gain/loss again? saw a video about it popping up in my feed but never watched it
[1:50:45] n1vlem: I think teamplay doesn't always show in stats, so performance based LP gain/loss would be unfair
[1:51:04] GN_John: i just got demoted from emerald 3 to gold 1 in 40 games because every single game was a 1-10 bot lane. it was a fun 2 weeks
[1:51:35] satori890: theren't preditction?
[1:51:39] DragoonRed: oh so thats not them saying they are not doing the trueskill2 system? they still going to do that? lol
[1:51:45] n1vlem: Sorry not sure if you answered me, I had ad
[1:52:09] Wobbinn: Wobbinn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:52:32] Angelyc: Abuse that ahri build until nerf GivePLZ
[1:52:46] DragoonRed: @n1vlem it takes in a lot of stats including like cc and other things. so if you are an engage tank and die a lot but get lots off cc and assists from what you do it would still count as "good"
[1:52:51] theLevya: remember that riot has conflict in interest as ranked games is what keeps people hooked
[1:52:54] GN_John: if you read my comment and had a reaction, i missed it because of ads lol
[1:52:59] DiscordLuck: any recomendations for cool phone cases?
[1:53:20] Afcb89: its preformaace based on the role tyupe. eg support score score
[1:53:23] n1vlem: Oke sounds better then
[1:53:33] monster2392: what will happen top top laners that play sion and go like 3/16
[1:53:43] brodyy186: Ola KP! Hope you are doing well!
[1:53:48] n1vlem: But if I sacrifice myself to save the ADC in any way, that's HUGE for team but bad for my stats for instance
[1:54:32] athousandbonerz: bausffs getting nerfed lmao
[1:54:34] mattress_wolf: Hi KP! nalopiHen
[1:54:46] MayaShieda: then riot has the absolute BALLZ to say losers q is not a real thing
[1:55:03] n1vlem: I agree, but how would it show in stats though, I look like someone inting? :D
[1:55:25] Galetea: Ive gotten yelled at by my adc for saving them before like stepping in front of a cait ult like HUH
[1:55:35] monster2392: yeah its the same for me, last 12 games are loss and no matter how i play the enemy always out perform or out macro. It seems like i also get all the toxic ego players.
[1:55:43] jexuzd: It has to be like the mastery points you get, if you get tons of gold and structure damage you perform well
[1:55:46] brodyy186: How is the EU grind going? Notice major differences between the region u are used to?
[1:56:10] theLevya: support easily can be rated on map presence, saving people from dying, kill participation, vision score etc
[1:56:20] J0LLYR0GER: Was checking the Match history  for my buddy in silver. His last 5 matches the enemy team (all silvers this split) were ALL plat last split like wtf LOL.
[1:56:31] theLevya: and also gold efficiency
[1:56:46] The_KungFro: @GN_John big oof. I'm sorry, boss. I've been on a loss streak due to wild bot gaps and junglers AFKing because of it, so I feel you
[1:57:13] jexuzd: Yessss
[1:57:16] GN_John: before that 40 game streak, i had demoted and promoted from plat to emerald like 7 times lol. idk whats going on anymore
[1:57:34] athousandbonerz: Damn KP getting fired up hell yea preach
[1:57:37] jkkzone: well said !!
[1:57:51] Niomah: It also makes someone being boosted by duoing with a high elo player smurfing as they just aren't going to do that well
[1:57:53] igao951: a
[1:58:01] J0LLYR0GER: goldyHMM goldyHMM goldyHMM goldyHMM
[1:58:03] jexuzd: Kels for balance team ✊✊
[1:58:15] shedfirekid1: @KayPea prediction?
[1:58:24] raw__gx: @KayPea hey beauty , how u doing <3 <3 <3
[1:58:25] MayaShieda: dude literally yesterday i told some dude we were winning till he started spamming and to consider becoming a completely different person  and it worked??? he stopped and focused on the game?? and we won ??? rare loot drop ong
[1:58:26] theLevya: making lp loss based on how bad you performed is gonna put the nail in the coffin of ranked trolls
[1:58:44] shedfirekid1: yeah the current ranking system is so screwed up. not to mention matchmaking is absolutely rigged'
[1:58:44] Afcb89: you cant say things liek that, it makes too much sense
[1:58:56] brax_ttv: do you ever play asol
[1:58:57] arcadedani: @theLevya i hope so
[1:59:02] MayaShieda: i feel special
[1:59:06] kingdomofblue: baus going to be in shambles if that happens, never getting out of silver LUL
[1:59:08] callmesky__: hello everyone rabidp2RedPandaJam
[1:59:37] mark__yeahhh: you need to work at riot and put them in their place
[1:59:41] arcadedani: and is going to help people realized that maybe JUST MAYBE they arent as perfect players as they think...
[1:59:44] w4ssboss: I got counter picked as lux by a yas yesterday, and absolutely smoked him! felt good!
[1:59:52] l4zyL3gz: Hi Kay! How are the games going this week? Didn't have much time to watch
[2:00:08] callmesky__: that song sounds like a big bossfight is just gonna happen no? LUL
[2:00:29] callmesky__: atleast in the beginning it did
[2:00:42] jexuzd: What about to have a record of sportmanship behaviour in order to queue for rank? To avoid crybabys and griefers
[2:01:01] Ryscha: will it though, i mean its not like they care for their lp anyway?
[2:01:11] DragoonRed: I think that is their goal with this change, is to stop the people who have main character syndrome who (can be good) from inting every game they are not hard winning
[2:02:22] Darkcyter: @arcadedani @Ryscha kaypHello kaypHello
[2:02:30] mattress_wolf: now that's assuming only the bad players quit
[2:02:36] jexuzd: MVP get double lp / no lost

[2:03:44] alluring_grace: Can make the loss less for those who did the best, everyone on loss still loses some just not as much
[2:03:51] kingdomofblue: have you tried electrocute on lux? i feel like that would outperform dark harvest at all stages of the game
[2:04:02] lewhitehd69: ks = leave kinda angle Keepo

[3:15:32] mouadh123b5: im streaming ur stream i hope u don t mind
[3:15:37] justice_bw: most important skill in dota2 is quickly muting all players
[3:15:45] jimbob_ywert: Dota 2 is in a bad state. it’s been basically abandoned and has very low play rates
[3:16:03] ericaborgest: oh hello it's the birb

[3:21:48] Smoothcollie: And when we take in consideration Anivia is a demingod...she has a lot of power for sure!
[3:22:07] AllOfKingsPotato: catJAM
[3:22:07] Niomah: also her ult has to form fully to do its max damage, his Q does full damage from moment one
[3:22:10] IoSonoBatman: Parrot* Kappa
[3:22:34] CheeseHead1337: You should pick A Sol- seems to be your playstyle

[3:30:45] HumbleT12: gg
[3:30:55] svyforiaa: people don’t like to listen period
[3:31:12] Hymuno: asol should lose hp whilst channeling, since he can't breath during it
[3:31:29] Smoothcollie: @rincewurst Well average lol player need to fck their ego over everything. And are where, like...under gold and above iron? They could take it for the day, then probably cry a river day after kaypLUL

[3:39:32] Rincewurst: I didnt mind buying wards... gave the limited inventory a more tactical weight
[3:39:50] RaynKire: Ya I was assuming it was more of a team diff situation looking at the scoreline

[3:41:55] RhaYn3n: Tell them to fk off League and go play Palworld
[3:41:56] via_trita: she was expecting too much from ult heals in that, if she was above 30-40% health, it wouldve played differently
