[1:00:52] cuscus9214: to recap ure saying that if u hv a good jungler u can evem try to 2v2 a gank, but if it's bad u need to get a lead and help defending objectives?
[1:02:22] cuscus9214: u have to use the lead somehow
[1:02:32] cuscus9214: but if ur bad jungler wont help u ull waste time top
[1:02:41] BroLeonST: !opgg
[1:02:48] cuscus9214: thats why i said lead

[1:27:28] cuscus9214: so u questioning his playstyle
[1:28:14] cuscus9214: ex rift
[1:28:23] kenshiro199X: Nashor just feels too good

[1:32:26] ScatterShotv: ipavBlush
[1:32:37] cuscus9214: u saying that malignance is mandatory?
[1:32:56] kenshiro199X: Ultimate hunter is a must then?
[1:33:32] cuscus9214: it's playstyle
[1:33:40] cuscus9214: same teemo, dofferent build
[1:36:51] kenshiro199X: If I'm ahead I want to trap up and keep the pressure on with Landry second I feel strong but not safe
[1:39:29] cuscus9214: wait tho
[1:39:48] cuscus9214: malignance give u more flexibility cause u have a new rune tree to use
[1:40:08] cuscus9214: or still domination runes, like the bounty, or item haste
[1:41:46] cuscus9214: previously u had to pick ult hunter
[1:41:48] cuscus9214: yes
[1:41:54] cuscus9214: u can go celerity pta

[2:10:52] zopius2: !build
[2:12:03] zopius2: whats the build?
[2:12:19] oliasticlol: What is the point of trying to beat more enemies rather than 1v1? If they are more then it might just be bad fight and bad position?
[2:12:30] zopius2: whats ur favorite vs aatrox? is it always nashor into liandry
[2:13:31] Der_Angelord: I don't really understand the question either
[2:14:11] maligant123: if think what he wants to say: everything else than 1v1 is useless. so go for a build and runes that are best for 1v1‚Ä¶
[2:14:34] oliasticlol: Ahh sorry i formed the question in a weird way... Ur answer explained it now ty, just survive
[2:14:35] maligant123: since when you are 1v2 you are just in an unfair fight and ur teammates can do something
[2:15:59] henrymichell2: MyAvatar
[2:16:14] Der_Angelord: MYAAA
[2:16:37] oliasticlol: very understandable!
[2:17:16] kenshiro199X: What's a better 3rd item then?
[2:17:20] oliasticlol: I think malignance is good if you plan on teamfighting during the game, a lot of value that way
[2:17:25] Der_Angelord: maybe malignance if you go teemo supp or smth, but there's better supps anyways
[2:22:34] oliasticlol: Manco is playing on "teemo69" rn

[2:33:29] Der_Angelord: why does she run into the jgl alone when she knows teemo is there LUL
[2:33:41] 514484: yes lmao, the 20s delay LUL
[2:34:05] 514484: zero reason for this guy to facecheck the bush KEKW

[2:35:11] 514484: not much armor will be built byt the other team
[2:35:50] oliasticlol: you think the trynd was ghosting as well? with those early invades
[2:36:25] pikapika_666_: sassy soraika
[2:37:27] oliasticlol: they are giving him LP and viewers at the same time, how generous
[2:38:21] maligant123: maybe he is build testing and gives a f***

[2:42:16] oliasticlol: I swear it Illaoi works for T1 cuz people just want to kill the streamer and then he does Illaoi stuff
[2:42:47] 4krian2: He does play it thou
[2:42:51] 4krian2: Check op.gg
[2:42:58] oliasticlol: He did climb very high with heimer as well last season

[2:43:21] pikapika_666_: close
[2:43:29] 4krian2: I believe it was
[2:44:23] 4krian2: Ilaoi is a stat pusher no, like Kench?
[2:46:52] 4krian2: Coz they take Lethal tempo as well
[2:47:37] 514484: double bow?
[2:48:09] 4krian2: @514484 Item that gives light and shadow stacks
[2:48:17] 4krian2: It's the new build path for it
[2:48:21] 514484: wtf!
[2:48:37] pikapika_666_: in previous game he didnt do it. Probably knew that soraka was ghosting.
[2:48:53] 514484: lol that build path
[2:50:10] kenshiro199X: T1 was complaining yesterday his team ahead and just making dumb plays in the team fights, someone made the point they must be nervous since a stadium full of people watching them
[2:50:55] 514484: lol they don't need this to make shitty plays
[2:51:04] pikapika_666_: i dont understand :)

[3:25:45] Edugator1: I have an interesting question. how to add to this table combinations of items that increase the speed of movement?
[3:27:07] pikapika_666_: that might depend on opponents
[3:27:12] Edugator1: movement speed of the champion
[3:27:52] pikapika_666_: question is about the value of speed vs damage
[3:28:31] Edugator1: items that increase your movement speed by 5%
