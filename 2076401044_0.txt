[1:33:22] imora702: yeah low elo players would flame you if you go AD KEKL
[1:34:04] FistShapedBumCorK: I perform a lot better with AD LB in Plat than I do with AP. Might just suit me more tho.
[1:34:39] notaaronjoshua: people with comments like that should have to post their op.gg for us to roast them first
[1:34:46] marousekk: im playing lb all games only ap, master elo
[1:35:04] marousekk: its more fun
[1:35:20] marousekk: oneshot anybody its so fun
[1:35:34] busreven: ye oneshot that udyr from last game
[1:35:45] marousekk: i like your ap jukes
[1:36:07] FistShapedBumCorK: @marousekk I super disagree it's more fun. Like half the games I play AP you can only even oneshot the ADC and that's if he doesn't have a competent sup
[1:36:08] huyaluren: did you start the whole statik shiv or ad lb play style?
[1:36:35] FistShapedBumCorK: in theory it's more fun, in practice AP feels like it gets cucked way more frequently
[1:36:43] busreven: ap leblanc is good as long as ur not playing vs tanks
[1:36:54] sander934: can you review my ***?
[1:37:09] FistShapedBumCorK: inb4 its viper

[1:38:25] sander934: can you check tylers op gg?
[1:39:02] Koley24: I like how when you give an explanation the guy just disappears and has no counters love people like that
[1:39:17] busreven: leblanc sitting with 47% winrate since people went back to ap and its sad
[1:39:19] notaaronjoshua: wait can people not type op.gg?
[1:39:23] Woking: Cats be like that, sometimes they want attention sometimes they do their own stuff
[1:39:24] NotASkiller: nah yeah it's common for cats to come make biscuits with people in bed
[1:39:25] kitschy_jean: ***
[1:39:58] jinsakaisama: 1-1 so far
[1:40:04] jinsakaisama: welcome back Bobby
[1:40:09] xblackwood: That's not weird, that's typical female cat behavior üò∏
[1:40:16] Woking: Whats the cats name
[1:40:27] tsunomi520: OMG dont worry bob when i first got my girl cat she was also like that
[1:40:31] tsunomi520: she opens up eventually!!!
[1:40:41] tsunomi520: she loves u for sure tho, they are just going thru a phase
[1:40:44] FistShapedBumCorK: @busreven AD LB was never picked more than AP in the first place. It was only really popular in high elo. Everything diamond and below was still playing AP.
[1:40:47] tsunomi520: ApuApustaja
[1:41:27] kitschy_jean: ya pets take some time to adjust to a new home
[1:41:34] mrovidi: @FistShapedBumCorK Not in my games buddy
[1:41:43] jinsakaisama: oh pog u have gosu on ur team
[1:41:50] NotASkiller: my cat immediately started cuddling at night :)
[1:41:52] FistShapedBumCorK: I don't know about in your games. I'm just going based off the stats. @mrovidi
[1:41:53] busreven: @FistShapedBumCorK she was on 49-50% winrate the first patches of the statikk shiv, best version lb ever
[1:42:01] sander934: Tyler in que Pog
[1:42:17] jinsakaisama: u have gosu as ur adc winnable
[1:42:30] NotASkiller: I got my baby from a shelter and he immediately started purring for hours non stop ü•π
[1:42:34] Ailyrhs: the only times ap is better is because u would've lost earlier so u can play more games
[1:42:41] notaaronjoshua: oh shit that is gosu
[1:42:49] jinsakaisama: yeah told u xD
[1:43:01] sander934: He lost 3 games today already
[1:43:19] FistShapedBumCorK: @bobqinxd I was talking about what was played more often, AP or AD. What am I supposed to go off of other than statistics? His experience lol?
[1:43:21] NotASkiller: which one is gosu
[1:43:25] sander934: he is on 20G 3W 17L
[1:43:26] notaaronjoshua: @NotASkiller kaisa
[1:43:30] NotASkiller: nicee
[1:43:40] NotASkiller: winnable
[1:44:39] FistShapedBumCorK: @busreven Oh ya for sure, all I'm saying is that even at the peak of statikk LB, AP was still the most played pick below diamond.
[1:44:46] FistShapedBumCorK: But you're right, that was nuts
[1:44:59] themaritimeguy: Ivern forgot the other side of the jungle existed
[1:45:28] notaaronjoshua: TEAM PLAYER
[1:45:31] busreven: @FistShapedBumCorK the first version, people built statikk and then full ap, miss those days
[1:45:38] jinsakaisama: top doesn‚Äôt matter tho

[1:54:48] FistShapedBumCorK: but hes built different i guess?
[1:54:55] Woking: Bobs Ad TF is wave clear and bully
[1:55:35] FistShapedBumCorK: ur wave clear isn't even faster by maxing Q after you get shiv. its just a red card and like 6 autos
[1:56:08] FistShapedBumCorK: maybe he knows some 5Head shit i dont
[1:56:09] Woking: But hitting backline with red card is too risky because you have to go too far up
[1:56:27] Woking: and once u use card they just all in on you cuz cd no gold card
[1:56:43] FistShapedBumCorK: idk, im just going off the chovy faker builds and they dont take Q til 13. but maybe ur right idk
[1:57:04] FistShapedBumCorK: im plat and barely play lol so idk
