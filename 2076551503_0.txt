[4:40:27] helluvatry: @lolreppy part of it is he clears backwave with 3 q and more ranks make it higher mana cost
[4:40:49] skilledspellz: @lolreppy also Q's cooldown doesnt scale down with levels, nor does the hp. only thing changing is base dmg and mana cost. so Q buffs make it so levels are less valuable if you look at it from waveclear standpoint
