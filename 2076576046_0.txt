[5:00:04] Dracima: eww
[5:00:04] hogleey: @neur0droid according to bbc science 'Most scientists define wetness as a liquid's ability to maintain contact with a solid surface, meaning that water itself is not wet, but can make other sensation. But if you define wet as 'made of liquid or moisture', as some do, then water and all other liquids can be considered wet.'

[5:26:11] navrrakadabra: im a GW2 guy
[5:26:13] nyxveil1: What's ur type of mmo?
[5:26:14] fusionnaveen1337: WAIT what about Pacific Drive? Xovias likes cars, right? And he was a mechanic person. It's PERFECT tinking tinking tinking
[5:26:14] s2julya: Lost ark is also a no no ?
[5:26:20] Ms_Teemo: the game was great and then there was the 20 million bugs, the insane drama from different factions, cheats to auto win wars, and somehow this all involved thousands of dollars of irl money and doxx drama
[5:26:22] DarthAchilles: I stopped playing when my guild stopped playing New World
[5:26:25] Ms_Teemo: it was wack af watching it go down

[5:27:28] fusionnaveen1337: @Quantum I think you would love the game called Pacific Drive. You have to scavenge resources to upgrade and customize your car and deal with enemies/mild horror stuff
[5:27:32] Str0mcaller: @Quantum they got a new ceo going for more team raids now apparently
[5:27:37] Ningbeck: I think we're spoiled with the number of games, but also the games are released half-assed Pout
