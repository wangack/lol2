[3:10:26] Exrale: MMO games have no idea what they're really doing. Everyone knows some things are bad, but new MMOs come out and they do the exact same thing anyway. Like how the leveling period is irrelevant and everyone just tries to get max level for the game to actually start. There's sooo many concepts like that in almost every MMO
[3:11:02] TaylorPls: @Exrale New World broke that mold. Progression through the whole game is pretty fulfilled
