[1:40:13] Zongo16: @facemints you still there hate watching bud? I'm worried about your mental health
[1:40:13] Naronor: @GarlicChampions hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords
[1:40:43] GarlicChampions: I see
[1:40:46] GarlicChampions: jeez
[1:41:15] Naronor: password hashing is also a common method to help with brute forcing
[1:41:38] timestream1: In most cases you've gotten phished and handed over your info
[1:41:44] aevra14: there was a study done, password length is way better than random shit
[1:41:52] aevra14: entropy and all that
[1:43:59] ftUncleDrew: my password has been the same for everything since i was 11 :)
[1:44:35] PillarofFlesh: hunter3 Kappa
[1:44:41] d_leloo: passwords are no longer being guess by humans is all software
[1:44:43] quaninter2: My password is Wingsofdeathforpresident Kappa

[1:45:18] valkari317: Ok serious question. i understand last hitting, but why arent u attacking minions in the interim?
[1:45:24] valkari317: you could be clearing ur wave quicker
[1:45:32] aevra14: does 6 item jax win against 6 item other guy, idk his name
[1:45:43] aevra14: ksante
[1:45:51] zikk0_: yes
[1:46:10] clockworkang3ls: FirstTimeChatter
[1:46:11] squallphin: My really important passwords are at least 32 characters ,including numbers,symbols and hig and lower case letters
[1:46:34] Zongo16: @valkari317 You do not want to shove your wave, it opens you up to ganks, you want to hold it on your side of the river
[1:47:20] ohSwayze: Password cracking isnt the main target anymore. Its the password hashes that they want to get. Just make solid passwords and dont share em and youll be fine.
[1:47:42] shadowwing86: A lot of the password protection is if someone got ahold of data dump from the account information.  brute force could be done but the increase delay gives time for the breach to be detected and and accounts secured
[1:47:43] MadSpectre47: i feel like everyone should be using a password manager anyway
[1:47:49] squallphin: Just don't go around clicking random links
[1:48:13] d_leloo: is can still be guess but the time increases exponentially which makes it not even worth it
[1:48:20] ohSwayze: 90% of cyber attacks are from users being dumb..
[1:48:30] aevra14: or reusing passwords and a company getting their database leaked
[1:48:49] quaninter2: People at work would create complex password but then write it down on a postit note next to their laptop LUL
[1:48:59] ohSwayze: A new fun one is deepfake voiceover calling in and getting PW resets
[1:49:12] Maeg: like baiting someone into talking about password preferences in a stream LUL
[1:49:13] Naronor: Oh yeah, we got a refresher on social engineering every 3 months here at work xD
[1:49:23] squallphin: Also changing password every 6 to 8 months in case the company gets hacked
[1:49:28] Komlin111: RIOT
[1:49:36] anothermk69: thats good to have a program who keep your password and generate a new1
[1:49:52] MadSpectre47: the problem with that is i'm not creative enough to make new great passwords >.<
[1:50:08] zikk0_: then use a password manager
[1:50:11] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[1:50:17] zikk0_: like any normal person
[1:50:24] MadSpectre47: i have one
[1:50:26] sleepvertical: why the fuck does Ksante do so much damage as a tank
[1:50:28] ohSwayze: They do on some. Think an ad video, target that employees name when you call into their internal HelpDesk, and hope you get a dumb person on the other end
[1:50:28] MadSpectre47: i love it
[1:50:33] aevra14: hey did you guys know jagex censors your password if you write it backwards?
[1:50:39] valkari317: Ok serious question. i understand last hitting, but why arent u attacking minions in the interim?
[1:51:02] MadSpectre47: attacking minions pushes the wave forward
[1:51:04] Advesperate: did you literally just ask that again?
[1:51:06] MadSpectre47: which you may not want to do
[1:51:09] squallphin: @valkari317 he dosen't want to push the lane
[1:51:12] Z8246: @Advesperate yep
[1:51:15] Advesperate: @valkari317 you were answered before lmfao
[1:51:18] ohSwayze: @valkari317 Its not a serious question when you ignore the people answering it
[1:51:21] zikk0_: he wants to control the wave
[1:51:21] valkari317: I am trying to get his perspective
[1:51:23] Zongo16: @valkari317 i told you last time you asked
[1:51:29] sleepvertical: @valkari317 bro watch and learn stop asking
[1:51:38] valkari317: He may have different reasoning
[1:51:50] jocelotknee: Soul of Cinder
[1:51:50] Zongo16: it is not 'his perspective" it is the objectively correct one
[1:51:56] ohSwayze: He doesnt lol.. He just doesnt want to push the wave fast
[1:51:57] valkari317: Or hhe may explain it in more depth
[1:52:06] valkari317: which is what i am hoping for
[1:52:36] squallphin: This dude ,the whole chat explaining it and he be like,nah there must be another reason
[1:52:40] Advesperate: wave management is a deeper subject than just not pushing or always pushing. just look up the billions of videos on it.
[1:53:01] DarthIgnas: will you go to help 3rd drake?
[1:53:01] valkari317: Or I am seeking more explanation than a sentence, strong possibility there too
[1:53:01] aevra14: war
[1:53:04] valkari317: calm down bros
[1:53:15] Zongo16: some guy keeps asking the same question, asking you why you aren't just auto attacking the minions to death to clear waves
[1:53:28] valkari317: I asked the question 2 times
[1:53:29] valkari317: not 8
[1:53:35] clockworkang3ls: get rekted nerd LUL
[1:53:37] Zongo16: we told him, and he said he wants to hear from you lol
[1:53:40] Naronor: There you go, you got your answer xD
[1:53:48] zikk0_: happy?😂
[1:53:57] matadoss: he mad
[1:54:00] clockworkang3ls: you got your answer, you're a moron
[1:54:05] Zongo16: we don't have to pretend
[1:54:11] Advesperate: just google wave management.
[1:54:25] MadSpectre47: because attacking the minions PUSHES THE WAVE which can be disadvantageous @valkari317
[1:54:32] PillarofFlesh: LETSGO
[1:54:37] sleepvertical: wings finna blast this nerd in a sec
[1:54:37] Komlin111: 1-7
[1:54:40] aevra14: ah yes the classic 1/7 elise gank

[3:53:31] friendlycrackdealer: YesYes
[3:53:37] HaxHai: I think at that point he should play Kogmaw instead so he can make full use of the passive
[3:53:37] lolske: maybe they should make LP gain based on performance, even if you get carried you can't get freelo
[3:53:39] Mikeykeaz: 1 If you agree
[3:53:45] SRRW95: Did renekton buffs happen in this patch

[4:46:55] derpstevenson: Nat 20 is an automatic success on attack rolls but not skill checks.
[4:47:12] jojayjoo: fucked the dragon and got the dragon pregnant
[4:47:30] derpstevenson: That's a house rule about skill checks
[4:47:41] NotASnekIRL: @jojayjoo nat 20 dragon fucker LUL
[4:47:41] DazzahNZ: yea if you try and fuck the dragon you are fighting in my game, your nat 20 means it doesnt eat you straight away
[4:47:52] Steel_Masquerade: You cant crit on skill checks based on Rules as Written but different dms will run different ways
[4:48:05] derpstevenson: Let's say the DM says sure roll a charisma check because you want to seduce the dragon but the DC is 30
[4:48:29] blue2327: "I'm not locked in with you. You're all locked in with me"
[4:48:30] derpstevenson: If you roll a nat20 and the result isn't 30 it's still a failure
[4:48:57] derpstevenson: Pretty common house rule for people to treat skill check nat 20 as a guaranteed success

[4:51:11] poketltu: Tomfoolery
[4:52:01] NotASnekIRL: thanks!
[4:52:45] derpstevenson: My money is on Smolder eventually losing the elder dragon auto kill. Impossible to balance around
[4:52:47] jojayjoo: stopwatch, most op item in the game
[4:52:56] casualgamer26: is it impossible to have a 60 minute plus game now? feel like I haven’t had one in years
[4:53:05] DazzahNZ: not really now that it's 1600 gold
[4:53:19] poketltu: Secured Kappa
[4:54:10] derpstevenson: @casualgamer26 anything is possible but it's very unlikely any more because of elder/baron and long enough death timers that a team will end the game off an ace way earlier than that
[4:54:59] NotASnekIRL: holy shit
