[6:40:27] SqueeSqush: This nibelheim segment was in the demo I think
[6:40:32] xHyunkelx: So, Zack is actually leaving it's own timeline ?
[6:40:37] Sentety: yes
[6:40:38] xHyunkelx: living*
[6:41:08] xHyunkelx: But it's still not the timeline of the original game
[6:41:22] westin1988: this part is pretty much the same to the og
[6:41:23] leo6gm: i wouldnt expect the og timeline at all after the first game
[6:41:33] xHyunkelx: Bad form for those squats !
[6:41:39] westin1988: seen the demo this part is the same
[6:42:00] xHyunkelx: @westin1988 It's definitely not, Zack and Aerith aren't supposed to be like that
[6:42:18] xHyunkelx: @westin1988 Oh, you mean the Nibelheim incident
[6:42:24] westin1988: yes
[6:42:40] westin1988: I do understand what you mean for the rest of it.
[6:42:40] Sentety: the last game cloud and team defeated the harbenger of fate or something of the sort which implies breaking of the canon by the devs which a lot of ppl interprated and it happens right as zack is about to die xHyunkelx
[6:43:10] leo6gm: HUH
[6:43:15] goupil1984: Deadge
[6:43:23] xHyunkelx: Yeah I know, I played the first part, but it wasn't 100% certain that Zack was living it's own timeline thingy
[6:43:36] xHyunkelx: This is pretty damn confusing... Whatever, we'll see

[6:44:06] westin1988: I need to play thru the remake again with the DLC.
[6:44:24] Sentety: xHyunkelx many ppl are speculating that at the end sepiroth has transcended everyone and is trying to create his own timeline and a lot of ppl think at some point zack timeline and cloud will merge and they will defeat him together its all speculation tho ofc
[6:44:33] bossthelevel: Cool iteration of the theme

[6:50:32] leo6gm: i wonder if by the end of the entire thing they tie it all together and set the timeline to the OG and just wanted to retell the story without having you just play the og again the exact same way
[6:50:49] Sentety: westin1988 if you remember red 13 running in the crater at the end xHyunkelx thats why its speculated as the bad ending
[6:50:58] xHyunkelx: @leo6gm If it's that, I'll be even less on board with those remake
[6:51:07] westin1988: playing it basically the exact same way was what I wanted really but so far this has been good @leo6gm
[6:51:13] xHyunkelx: If you want to tell a new story, just make a new game, be creative
[6:51:26] leo6gm: xHyunkelx isnt that what they're doing
[6:52:02] xHyunkelx: @Sentety It's a really good ending tho, since it goes perfectly with the main theme of the OG game, about saving the planet and letting Nature flourish

[6:52:39] TriHardSupporter: rumble so aids as nasus
[6:52:54] xHyunkelx: @leo6gm In my opinion no, because they need to attach that story to their most beloved game ; probably because they're afraid it would bomb otherwise
