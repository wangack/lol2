[0:55:50] rapheelol: Yeah the naut has 12 deaths avg in the last games with a kp avg of less then 10
[0:56:15] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: ur unironically 1 and a half levels down
[0:56:31] thebuzzzkilla: This naut is using his brain i think
[0:56:34] wastemanforlife: how is that naut in your game
[0:56:36] seeby01: tragic
[0:56:41] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: ad is strong
[0:56:50] wastemanforlife: you legit pinged her level and he did that
[0:56:52] its_rekky: "go next" mentality is so annoying
[0:56:59] shaavola: Queue mid fk supports
[0:57:02] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @its_rekky yh bro this game winnable for sure
[0:57:10] Durmanush: why would you not go next here LUL supp is inting
[0:57:23] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: getting outscaled in every lane but jg ig]
[0:57:44] olekron: @its_rekky i agree, but its hard to not have it when you are 2 lvls down as draven vs zeri
[0:57:47] shiwamamo: that lulu is really good
[0:57:49] shiwamamo: icl
[0:57:56] its_rekky: not specifically about this game but this is what people hear from streamers and adapt into their own games
[0:58:01] Zexard: lul lil bro thinking draven losing early game, denied of stack, having an ape support is still winable
[0:58:14] h0llw: i hate the never ff mentality ngl if i think i learned from a game i want to move onto the next one
[0:58:15] Durmanush: lulu almost won that, but still winnable right...
[0:58:49] olekron: @its_rekky yea, been saying that for some years. Not only the "go next" mentality but also the glorification of toxicity
[0:58:51] rapheelol: I honestly think that the jailing mentality some people got is honestly a grief
[0:58:55] gonzavalencia: and what if some1 wants to keep playing
[0:59:13] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: it doesnt matter if one person wants to play
[0:59:16] rapheelol: Like youre 0-25 with no chance of outscaling why even not surrending
[0:59:17] townofbird: i definitely dont like to ff any real winnable game but this isnt one
[0:59:38] lastguardian_: when did they change it so at 15 minutes only 4 people need to vote yes?
[0:59:42] squidbub: thoughts on jankos nidalee clip  teammates ff on him
[0:59:45] Archnomad: I just tuned in, what actually happened in lane?
[0:59:53] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: shit level 2
[1:00:00] shaavola: Average support brain happened
[1:00:11] Elian__: rumble support one trick btw
[1:00:16] Durmanush: it was a normal summoners rift experience
[1:00:35] seeby01: can you review the early laning phase after the game
[1:00:42] roogoh: @seeby01 yes!
[1:00:45] townofbird: wouldve been such a fun draven game if naut wasnt running it

[1:03:38] townofbird: ah i wouldve thought dravens mobility makes him decent into hwei
[1:03:57] shiwamamo: he just perma spams skillshots
[1:04:08] 7HeII: draven gets fked by poke and waveclear aswell and he has a lot of that no?
[1:04:12] shiwamamo: playing against hwei support as draven is the most cancer shit
[1:04:27] adibeleaua: if u play from behind as draven should you still go for hubris or go for cheap dmg like youmuus
[1:04:28] townofbird: great points, i see it now
[1:05:03] unproven25: have a good stream
[1:05:22] Durmanush: sounds better than Hubris in this game state
[1:05:24] vebaixaaa: do u look at the axes when play draven?
[1:05:33] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: any adc would me more usefulk

[1:06:25] adibeleaua: @FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW idk draven even if behind can comeback with passive stacks
[1:07:03] OniricoTV: actually winnable
[1:07:30] townofbird: @vebaixaaa you wanna play enough draven that you catching axes doesnt take away your attention
[1:08:20] DonaldMungchi: NAHH Zeri items
[1:08:32] wastemanforlife: cash out needs to happen
[1:08:38] its_rekky: thoughts on zyra jungle?
[1:08:48] Durmanush: maybe that guy was right about the go next mentality LUL
[1:08:53] adibeleaua: you got this jack, all you need is an ult execute on them
[1:09:02] kun1231231: if you lose your passive stacks now would you still think its winnable?
[1:09:05] konas00: caliste on zeri? or im i wrong chat?
[1:09:17] konas00: i dont have the apm jack has xd
[1:09:30] shiwamamo: wtf is caliste

[1:10:57] adibeleaua: veigarv2 said something about high elo being bad because they dont care about winning
[1:11:00] shiwamamo: u wont die and lose ur stacks now Clueless
[1:11:03] adibeleaua: so every game is winnable
[1:11:03] wastemanforlife: and the throw
[1:11:08] its_rekky: why is Senna so strong rn? (highest win%)

[1:13:04] wildriftboi1: who needs movespeed when a hwei uses every slow ability possible
[1:13:10] Archnomad: You should try playing him bot as a Draven counter Kappa
[1:13:19] wildriftboi1: lmfao
[1:13:31] wildriftboi1: yea that might be the backbreaker not stopping his base
[1:13:36] townofbird: its so cursed lmao
[1:13:42] adibeleaua: your naut looks like an ai from elon musk ngl
[1:14:49] JuiceePlug: i just joined but i feel like draven is so support reliant especially since you need to walk up and refresh axes during landing phase
[1:15:00] PlebHunter27: naut is playing for dmg dealt
[1:15:10] gonzavalencia: minions r so fed
[1:15:13] Archnomad: you have so many stacks it's making me anxious :X

[2:16:47] Valle2: @eDGORan I think the best is too test what suits you the best in practice tool and then just play
[2:16:48] FunkyBarmen: how do i become viper @Jackspektra
[2:16:57] maxozabojca99: @eDGORan maybe use attack on left click
[2:17:03] stkyg: @FunkyBarmen you mean how do you become spektra...
[2:18:16] Valle2: like test different attack move/click settings and then stick too one. At some point it starts to feel natural

[2:18:57] Sintemon: yea thats why I always disliked manamune builds
[2:19:00] Sintemon: feels bad in soloq
[2:19:06] Sintemon: to not have q evo early
[2:19:32] thebuzzzkilla: manamune is a cheap way to get q evo tho
[2:19:51] maxozabojca99: @thebuzzzkilla eclipse is cheap too but yeah
[2:20:14] caraig2003: manamune 100%
[2:20:42] xrecurve: this naut a bit dizzy
[2:21:02] hbsz: did you know the zeri you playing vs plays locked cam?
[2:21:04] Sintemon: eclipse is 100% better for soloq from my experience (gm kaisa enjoyer but not otp)
[2:21:07] caraig2003: I rush eclipse on Kai'sa everytime manamune is my 2nd item mostly
[2:21:12] Sintemon: manamune can be good in pro i think
[2:21:31] aloneinthedisco_: hi
[2:21:44] DonnTeoo: there is a build on kai sa with eclipse ? What else do you go ?
[2:21:49] dyztx: Wouldnt envolved w be better then boots here?
[2:21:50] JoilantArgus: eclipse just kinda busted in general right now it feels like
[2:22:00] JoilantArgus: too cost efficient
[2:22:06] Sintemon: yea
[2:22:11] Sintemon: eclipse kinda op item
[2:22:17] jeanhadrien: u can just* go eclipse with doran for Q evolve into nashor for W E evolves
[2:22:33] vens147: what do you think about the statikk shiv into rageblade build
[2:22:57] caraig2003: Yone just chilling top lane
[2:23:00] caraig2003: xdd
[2:23:28] ensiemen: U supposed to put extra point into q?
[2:23:36] Sacheldr: @jackspektra  did this build includes evolved E?
[2:23:42] Kasunylol: Do you max w or e on eclipse build
[2:23:54] maxozabojca99: depends if you go on hit or ap imo
[2:23:58] caraig2003: @Sacheldr E evolve in this build path is kinda meh you're mostly focus on aoe and pokle
[2:24:07] Sintemon: yes, have the same feeling
[2:24:15] Sintemon: dont think the build is IT for soloq
[2:24:27] caraig2003: Yone is top again with tp xdd
[2:24:29] ascuane: ult into diana ult
[2:24:31] ascuane: LUL
[2:24:35] ascuane: looked so funny
[2:24:39] caraig2003: Oh he did tp top earlier ICANT
[2:24:41] Sacheldr: @caraig2003 got it, ty
[2:24:45] h0llw: wont lie this build seems ass
[2:24:50] maxozabojca99: I reckon the ap build scales pretty good but you need to hit W
[2:24:52] thebuzzzkilla: shadowfalme now?
[2:25:12] ascuane: is ludens really that much better than nashors
[2:25:14] caraig2003: @Sacheldr np boss
[2:25:15] ascuane: im curious
[2:25:27] Sintemon: azir is generally an angry person haha
[2:25:27] JDragon7309: its cryptbloom into liandrys right?
[2:25:36] maromega8: why are you going ap build
[2:25:49] shaavola: How does the evolve e cancel work, you press e and while moving press evolve?
[2:26:01] maromega8: u press e and recall
[2:26:30] shaavola: E>b>evolve?
[2:26:38] maromega8: storm/statik rb ap way better no?
[2:26:51] maromega8: @shaavola yes in that order but really fast
[2:26:57] Quackologist: @shaavola either click E and level up or press b and left click the level up icon. Both works
[2:27:12] JDragon7309: @shaavola all the evolve cancels are easiest if you click on the evolve and press b immediately after
[2:27:13] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!

[2:29:18] LoLCryner: i love this build
[2:29:28] maxozabojca99: what are the remaining items? shadowflame and?
[2:29:35] LoLCryner: Zven spammed it in korea last 2 weeks
[2:29:37] ascuane: but doesnt manamune also proc on attacks
[2:29:41] ascuane: wouldnt that make sense aswell
[2:29:45] LoLCryner: remaining items are cryptbloom, horizon focus
[2:29:47] shaavola: I tested eclipse luden it felt decent but im lowelo😂
[2:29:57] LoLCryner: rabadons
[2:29:58] its_rekky: ludens kinda dogshit tho
[2:29:59] shaavola: The shield is so fking good
[2:30:11] maxozabojca99: @LoLCryner tyty
[2:30:15] ascuane: does eclipse proc off ludens?
[2:30:18] ascuane: or why

[2:30:40] grayzack2: have you tried kraken into terminus?
[2:30:52] shaavola: Did you go the triple tonic max w by 11 tech?
[2:30:55] ClickJJ: GG always a pleasure having human person on adc :D

[2:35:38] jenni_ttv: eclipse into nashor works here no?
[2:35:39] ascuane: they can just heal it
[2:35:43] ascuane: with nida soraka no
[2:36:17] DonnTeoo: You vs Jankos ?
[2:36:21] Sintemon: soraka cant heal indefinitely cause she cant hit q into high range
[2:36:23] VayneIsLame: would u go eclipse build if they had seraphine or sona
[2:36:32] Sintemon: bless you
[2:36:39] DonnTeoo: bless you

[2:38:54] Sintemon: @Dragdar would be such a good game then
[2:39:23] mams__: @Dragdar playing with engage support wouldn't be as sweet if we didn't have to play with the rest
