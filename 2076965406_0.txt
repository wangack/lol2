[0:41:32] Majorachu: see deez what Hmmm
[0:41:35] 33AXX: holy chad
[0:41:58] shy_katie_kat: Hii first time here! I'm new to top lane, and riven, and was curious if you could give me a bit of insight on when to start dorans shield, blade, or long sword pots please :)
[0:42:11] heaven_Chuu: Longsword 3 pots is so risky jesus
[0:42:16] CaiusBloodRaven: @meemi1337 giga chad but what can i do to him when i play riven?
[0:42:20] vainss6: Viper doesnt build proface anymore?
[0:42:29] vainss6: profane*
[0:42:41] imibby_: Good morning viper hope you’re having a good day
[0:43:00] alien1388: cuz he's him
[0:43:05] shy_katie_kat: Ohhh oki ty!
[0:43:16] meemi1337: @CaiusBloodRaven Hmm,Try to rush lvl 2 faster than him and all in early
[0:43:35] 33AXX: wtf
[0:43:43] 0Huh: @shy_katie_kat also d shield gives health only which is bad vs vayne so it dpends
[0:44:01] CaiusBloodRaven: @meemi1337 got it thx i will try
[0:44:18] shy_katie_kat: @0Huh oh because of her silver bolts?
[0:44:35] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[0:44:41] 0Huh: @shy_katie_kat every third attack she deals bonus max health dmg
[0:44:43] meemi1337: @CaiusBloodRaven If it aint gonna work just farm and try to roam if u get prio from top
[0:44:56] meemi1337: @CaiusBloodRaven Or just w8 for jgl
[0:45:27] 33AXX: crazy gank from belveth tbh
[0:45:42] ReaLMaxy: @0Huh this is incorrect. The value it gives by the health regen and the hp is way more valuable than the extra smidge damage vayne does with silver bolts early on
[0:45:50] ScrapRebirthII: ur jungler is kinda cringe
[0:45:58] 33AXX: @ScrapRebirthII ye idk this guy is lost asf

[0:48:30] 0th3rwise: all the lanes are paying like psychos
[0:48:35] imibby_: so many games have been lost for grubs it’s so depressing when people flip games for grubs
[0:49:05] heaven_Chuu: We go roam!
[0:49:08] bweadconnoisseur: Build edge of knight no?
[0:49:14] ReaLMaxy: @0Huh Correct, but taking dshield was always about surviving in lane better in lanes where you do not have prio like this one. The damage wouldnt make a difference if you cant use the damage
[0:49:33] wendyspicy: huge
[0:49:35] gentiluomo_: i told u
[0:49:40] wendyspicy: but the jungle is very bad

[0:50:35] astro___wolf: grubs r over rated tbh
[0:50:38] imibby_: both are so good @wukongrespectoor
[0:50:57] heaven_Chuu: 5/6 grubs
[0:50:58] gentiluomo_: evry time you die or miss say  " this game is lost "
[0:50:59] dobael: grubs turret gold
[0:51:00] heaven_Chuu: Too free

[0:51:31] astro___wolf: im a jg so i dont hit towres xdd
[0:51:36] imibby_: low elo grubs are more op
[0:51:50] wendyspicy: why spear here
[0:51:59] heaven_Chuu: Cool downs very good
[0:52:05] gentiluomo_: true dameg is overrated
[0:52:16] johnny_versace: Did you know that your distinct clicking rythym of keys during your fast q combo was the thing that made me finally learn the fast q combo fully?
[0:52:18] iamnolan4: yup cds to match tumble and condemn
