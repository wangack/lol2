[7:17:53] ronavni: why is sett so weak now\
[7:21:16] ging3raffe: I personally don't think he's really weak if anything this is the best he's been in a while just other bruisers have gotten a lot more
[7:21:27] ging3raffe: either through buffs like Darius and Yorick or items like morde.
[7:21:46] swoocer: Sett is the weakest he's been
[7:21:49] swoocer: In yeats
[7:22:06] swoocer: His w is fucking worthless sub 2.5k this season max build
[7:22:39] Citrussyyy: This voli skin is hilarious the way he comes barreling with all has fatness and police siren
[7:22:54] Citrussyyy: His*
[7:22:57] swoocer: Compared to his 4k last season. No goredrinker to scale hp and ad off. The made his autos slightly better while neither increasing nor decreasing his mobility
[7:23:14] swoocer: They took his best items removed all the cdr on them and made then cost the same
[7:23:37] swoocer: So not only is he losing w power he also loses all of his cdr
[7:23:47] seigebrisbane: no talk to team :D

[7:26:54] Cardellini90: hull prob not bad since yorick will prob just split push
[7:26:55] ging3raffe: it's just opinion really I think Sett is a lot more AA focused than he used to be is all
[7:26:57] swoocer: It was good last season but so much has chamged
[7:27:11] swoocer: 109% he is more aa focused
[7:27:21] swoocer: Ur absolutely correct and that's why he's weaker
[7:27:48] swoocer: Take an already immobile champ and make him need to be even closer to you tk dish out max damage
[7:28:09] seigebrisbane: dang man
[7:28:15] seigebrisbane: tough games
[7:28:33] fishingenjoyer69: @swoocer Sett is an AA champ, with no abilities to reach the opponents PoroSad
[7:29:00] ging3raffe: Yeah I do think they need to do what they did to Voli to him and give him more MS on his q
[7:29:05] ging3raffe: I think that would help some
[7:29:29] fishingenjoyer69: @ging3raffe And fix his r bug and buff W ad ratio
[7:29:59] Hinata_San8: 3-8 auto aut0D what happen
