[3:50:22] Gragnoth: @SylHoliday early game poppy has to play kinda safe, get her e and play around messing up riven's gameplay, poppy should never be engaging
[3:50:41] SylHoliday: lgwG
[3:50:53] Gragnoth: which it looks like poppy is being aggressive which is now how you play the matchup
[3:51:33] 9fierce9: How dare you stream league as im at uni, you really hate me RAGEY

[4:04:33] cyberlapse: depends on ur acting skiils
[4:04:35] 9fierce9: I would much rather watch paint dry and grass grow
[4:04:38] olavi14: Rp is fine
[4:04:48] SylHoliday: if I wanted to watch GTA rp I would be watching GTA rp instead KEKW
[4:04:49] kendrathompson15: gta is really.. eh
[4:04:51] cocoachu_: people say they won't like rp but then become addicted to watching
[4:04:53] PoteetLee: chat can get...interesting.
[4:04:53] pennant5: I've watched it for 3 years but I'm not sure how you would fit
[4:04:54] Nightbot: 5upL
[4:04:54] hannnnnnahhhhh: i think it‚Äôs boring :(
[4:04:58] FrozenLavaReflector: I'll be honest, you sound like a horrible fit for GTARP
[4:05:00] olavi14: !rank
[4:05:00] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond III 34 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[4:05:15] Tirmel: I think you'd be a good RP player, but GTA is not it
[4:05:19] witchyasgod: I've never watchd GTA roleplay so idk, but I'd like to see you try it out
[4:05:22] HARPUIN: I personally dont see the appeal of watching, but I imagine playing gta rp is fun
[4:06:23] PoteetLee: Rosieshockblink
[4:06:26] PoteetLee: Stay strong.
[4:06:28] FrozenLavaReflector: 2022 February
[4:06:31] FreeXe: The only GTA RP I can watch is Fuslie, the insanity is just too funny. Other than that I do not see the appeal either
[4:06:45] kendrathompson15: it is def not for poteet lol
[4:06:47] 9fierce9: No
[4:06:52] PoteetLee: No.
[4:06:59] kendrathompson15: I feel sleepy would make it more amusing
[4:07:01] Tirmel: If you were to play a different game and RP in that, that would be cool
[4:07:14] B1dvig: I would watch, have seen Ellum goof around and enjoyed it
[4:07:18] piveel: hello
[4:07:19] PoteetLee: 100000% would jokingly not watch. I downloaded chatterino so I can mod ellum's chat without having stream open.
[4:07:21] 9fierce9: Its a boring game
[4:07:23] PoteetLee: Wait.
[4:07:28] PoteetLee: take out the jokingly.
[4:07:31] PoteetLee: I'm losing it.
[4:07:31] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:07:33] HuevoLitoEU: find it boring
[4:07:33] AkitaAttribute: It's not that I hate gta.  It's more just the RP isn't that exciting.
[4:07:40] Drude27: Personally I just dont care for open world games in general
[4:07:54] vsmilotic: LUL
[4:07:57] AkitaAttribute: Sure there are highlights, but there are also lots of lulls.
[4:07:59] vsmilotic: Faker what was that Kappa
[4:07:59] Tirmel: There's a lot of stuff in the game that I think could attract a not so great audience of people
[4:08:00] piveel: the only good gta in my eyes is san andreas
[4:08:07] Cobiah_: I haven't watched GTA RP yet but it just doesn't sound very appealing for my taste
[4:08:11] PoteetLee: @vsmilotic üíÄ
[4:08:11] kendrathompson15: the rp really doesn't do much.
[4:08:13] cyberlapse: that was u n f o r t u n a t e
[4:08:33] vsmilotic: LUL
[4:08:35] Gragnoth: My sister's ex fianc√© was abdicated to GTA and he abused my sister and her kid (not his kid) and honestly I just associate the game with that asshole who made me get dressed in front of him because I was "late" to dropping his daughter off at daycare (which he could have done but didn't want to)
[4:08:52] Gragnoth: addicted*
[4:08:53] PoteetLee: Oh addicted.
[4:08:54] Tirmel: Shit, Gragnoth that sucks
[4:08:57] PoteetLee: I was wayyy confused for a second.
[4:09:10] piveel: agree
[4:09:13] Gragnoth: lol
[4:09:16] PoteetLee: Neither appeal to me in the slightest.
[4:09:19] kendrathompson15: agreed
[4:09:20] Evuszka: i used to watch polish gta rp and my goodness gracious, im so glad im free from it. never was interested in the english scene so idk if its in anyway similar so Shruge maybe its better
[4:09:29] cocoachu_: agreed
[4:09:34] Gragnoth: @Tirmel  I
[4:09:36] PoteetLee: But having watched/modded gtp rp...I would not be a happy camper.
[4:09:46] Gragnoth: @Tirmel I am just glad my sister left him finally a couple years ago
[4:09:48] vsmilotic: faker what was that again Kappa
[4:10:05] Nightbot: 5upL
[4:10:09] Evuszka: @PoteetLee oh peepoPat
[4:10:14] B1dvig: He flashed?
[4:10:55] cyberlapse: whener i read faker what was that i remind myself that dissapointment in the casters voice
[4:10:57] PoteetLee: It seems like the streamers enjoy it though! I can picture 5up liking it with the right group.
[4:11:04] piveel: 5 do you play with locked cam
[4:11:27] kendrathompson15: sleepy playing it would definitely make him just messing around the whole time
[4:11:46] dorboria: @PoteetLee yes u r righ
[4:12:07] PoteetLee: I see.
[4:12:11] vebo_0: ello yarrBongos

[4:12:32] AkitaAttribute: I did stop watching Sykk because I'm just not about the constant gta grind
[4:12:33] PoteetLee: I'd be on chatterino.
[4:12:34] FreeXe: Janet kept saying that RP is cringe, and now she is RP'ing every day
[4:12:38] AkitaAttribute: I'll go back tho
[4:12:41] FrozenLavaReflector: It's time to unfuck the MMR before then end of march
[4:13:01] bentgrassxx: gta is one of these games that if you miss one stream you get lost
[4:13:02] PoteetLee: EyesSus
[4:13:10] jeinsnow: That feels so wholesome
[4:13:11] PoteetLee: I'd finally be free though.
[4:13:32] Gragnoth: gotta afk, be back later everyone! <3 enjoy the games 5up! see you in a bit
[4:13:41] kendrathompson15: lol poor poteet just wanting out of gta
[4:13:41] lsdjesus420: what is this game ?

[4:13:51] PoteetLee: I'm at 1.8 million channel points. You're right.
[4:13:56] piveel: no matter what game you pick you will always come back to league
[4:13:58] vebo_0: btw the emote is based on real life, for some reason that ferret(beans?) likes to splash the water on the dispenser and that moment become a bongoCat emote
[4:14:24] B1dvig: Poteet fell off FeelsBadMan
[4:14:31] piveel: is this some kind of poker
[4:14:40] PoteetLee: It's fun little game.
[4:14:40] AkitaAttribute: I'm actively writing a mod for this game so that streamers can have a browser source scorecard for tournaments.
[4:15:00] PoteetLee: AkitaAttribute nice. I think that's what I heard dumbdog wanting.
[4:15:04] PoteetLee: I was only half listening though.

[4:15:08] LexieLoo332: balatro is my newest addiction, if i open it its like 4 hours gone easy
[4:15:33] PoteetLee: It's a very easy game to play and fun game to try and play well.
[4:15:36] Drude27: Right I have not lost as many hours on a single game in a long time
[4:15:42] AkitaAttribute: @PoteetLee Yeah literally making it cause I was watching when he said he needed something to score with.
[4:15:57] PoteetLee: Nice!
