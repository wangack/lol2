[0:09:23] TheQuackleDK: Gonna be collecting milk from farmers HypeLUL
[0:09:49] koushik_10: why do they want to dodge even after seeing ur account with good win rate smurfing masters
[0:09:50] milkweed_love: 39% wr naafiri, be the 39 not the 61. you can definitely do it first timing the champ in jungle
[0:10:14] TheQuackleDK: Do you think dodging should be punished harder?
[0:10:44] Mikytka: I have a feeling we wont see a game today :D
[0:11:01] milkweed_love: sucks harder waiting 30 minutes for a game cuz of all the dodging
[0:11:09] grandmakrystal: EZ JUNGLE?! let‚Äôs gooooo
[0:11:30] koushik_10: but i have seen lot of high elo streamerss play ez jgl
[0:11:32] TheQuackleDK: Some people just have a superiority complex
[0:11:43] grandmakrystal: good morning! I do not doubt this Ez jungle at all. I am a believer!!
[0:12:10] TheQuackleDK: I doubt Ezreal jungle but I believe in Santorin HypeLUL
[0:12:17] Cm4roljina: but why not just tell them youre santorin
[0:12:21] Nightbot: @grandmakrystal -> Questionable judgement. [stop posting links] [warning]

[0:15:11] TheQuackleDK: Kappa
[0:15:53] spectreOO8: Cassiopia jungle?
[0:16:00] arthalie: I remember when people were messing with Lucian jg and Ez jg was actually competitively viable
[0:16:02] solidussovis: Mornign Santo. How we feeling today.
[0:16:03] ani671: What elo is this? These names look similar to ones KP has played with/against. Specifically the Raptor dude.

[0:16:25] milkweed_love: cho is a lot of fun

[0:18:33] arthalie: I'm sad blerg only for to play one runeglaive rs game on stage
[0:18:40] arthalie: Ex
[0:18:46] arthalie: Ez wtf lol
[0:19:33] ntmadeit: belv getting nerfed next patch right
[0:20:30] solidussovis: So I just learned if I don't like the draft lock in Ez jungle and someone will dodge. Nice
[0:20:42] arthalie: If kindred had a higher play rate she'd get gutted, I swear they'll turn into another Zilean where they won't touch the champ so no one starts playing them
[0:21:46] noonifer: naked belveth
[0:22:16] koushik_10: guys i opened the cap lets goooooo jgl diff
[0:22:21] arthalie: Belvussy out there for the world
[0:24:47] aln045: Hello chat Chatting
[0:27:07] milkweed_love: lol naked belveth sounds funny I should google search it
[0:29:18] arthalie: @santorin how does eclipse work on belveth? Does e proc the separate hits by itself?
[0:30:44] NachoLazer_: Do you know da hwei
[0:31:15] koushik_10: btw u cant see if enemy is take grubs anymore
[0:31:19] koushik_10: right?
[0:31:33] NachoLazer_: Were you ever able to?
[0:31:48] NachoLazer_: Doesn't it just notify when all 3 are slain?
[0:31:50] mutante_07: ur fault :D admitly
[0:31:58] mutante_07: u force that
[0:32:24] PrasinaC: altid supportens skyld ;)

[0:32:41] mutante_07: they hunted u
[0:33:16] Euheimr: @arthalie just tested this in practice tool - no it does not. it counts as 1 ability or attack. E>AA procs it but not just E
[0:33:53] arthalie: Ty for the check, was curious if I was cooking there üç≤
[0:36:06] Euheimr: NODDERS npnp you might be cooking tho
[0:37:32] mutante_07: dont throw my friend Santo, its ur game!!!
[0:37:36] PrasinaC: THUNDER
[0:37:38] Tkochad: BC got buffed no?
[0:37:39] mutante_07: through***
[0:38:00] arthalie: Iceborn terminus?
[0:38:02] koushik_10: steraks
[0:40:05] arthalie: Actually probably jaksho
[0:40:11] NachoLazer_: mY yAs iS nOt gRieFinG LUL
[0:41:45] Caendred: Shouldn't new hullbreaker be super strong in belveth? The bonus auto damage is now on-hit and loosing out on being able to buff lane minions is not that big of a trade-off for hull crazy stats @santorin
[0:42:32] Caendred: Plus as belveth you actually want to use the minion buff for when you get the big push with void babies moments
[0:42:47] risingstar13: Do you still talk to S√∏ren? :D
[0:42:48] mutante_07: YASUO WON THAT SITUATION :D <3
[0:43:22] Tkochad: banner of command day s:)
[0:43:26] hintIO: I'M HUNTING ALONE
[0:44:09] arthalie: Still mad they made voidmites a thing but we can't have zzrotnback
[0:45:05] Caendred: This patch they changed the bonus damage you get every fifth auto from on attack to on-hit meaning bel procs it super fast. You don't need to be isolated anymore to capitalize on the item, it gives super good stats (65Ad, 400hp, 5%MS) and makes you buff minions when close to them which is super good for bel @santorin
[0:45:36] Caendred: Speaking about new hull btw
[0:46:09] risingstar13: Do you know if S√∏ren still plays league? :D
[0:46:17] dotherightthing7: omfg lol banner
[0:46:31] arthalie: Banner was fun except for those last couple patches with the inting soon meta
[0:46:32] S0GD: zz'rot, banner etc, all aids items
[0:46:36] arthalie: Sion
[0:46:59] NachoLazer_: A zz in the hands on El Truco, was golden
[0:47:17] noonifer: big dubs
[0:47:39] PrasinaC: what is bjerg doing now?
[0:47:57] arthalie: Have we done Aatrox jg yet?
[0:48:44] worldparadise420: Hi Santorin
[0:49:11] Caendred: New hull now makes your fifth auto deal bonus damage that scales with your HP on-hit meaning bel procs it super fast. You don't need to be isolated anymore to capitalize on the item, it gives super good stats (65Ad, 400hp, 5%MS) and makes you buff minions when close to them which is super good for bel @santorin
[0:49:17] koushik_10: are u going to watch dune 2 ?
[0:49:32] NachoLazer_: Damn this guy does not wanan give up on the hullbreaker LUL
[0:50:28] arthalie: Let the prophet of hullbreaker cook
[0:50:32] dotherightthing7: part 1 came out in 2021 part 2 comes out tomorrow in USA GoatEmotey
[0:51:14] worldparadise420: Dune movie is dope

[0:51:25] dotherightthing7: Poggers that‚Äôs a very USA movie
[0:51:27] worldparadise420: did u watch in AMC theathres?

[0:52:42] ani671: Theyre the same kids from last lobbies. Lol.
[0:52:49] solidussovis: The original Dune movie came out the year I was born. These remakes are really good too
[0:53:24] worldparadise420: Is LA one of your favorite places ?
[0:53:36] solidussovis: 1984 my friend
[0:54:10] solidussovis: the 80s were a time my dude
[0:54:19] arthalie: It's the 80s lol
[0:54:51] arthalie: Mundo?
[0:55:00] solidussovis: the whole decade was cursed... other then the music.
[0:55:45] koushik_10: @solidussovis u were born the same year as my mom
[0:56:03] ThePeePuddle: Good day Sir! Hope you're having a great time! Any surprise favorites of the champs you've gone through so far?
[0:56:07] solidussovis: @koushik_10 Yeah I am one of the Viking grandpas here
[0:56:54] I_Am_Chanman: Chogath looks really strong here
[0:57:04] arthalie: I feel like protobelt more is legit sleeper
[0:57:09] arthalie: Morde
[0:57:09] solidussovis: The Orn jungle you did was so surprisingly good
[0:57:37] worldparadise420: your comments on Rhaast buff for patch 14.5 ?
[0:58:55] koushik_10: but tarzaned plays a lot ezreal jgl no ?
[0:58:55] ThePeePuddle: can ez Jungle?
[0:59:06] arthalie: Everyone remembers you as a tank jgz no one remembers the MSai nidalee
[0:59:41] koushik_10: xin
[0:59:53] arthalie: Shaco?
[1:00:15] I_Am_Chanman: MORDE

[1:03:01] scubasteve932_: riven w
[1:03:06] koushik_10: u wanted phase rush?
[1:03:07] arthalie: Morde was a human warlord, he died and became the god of death and bound his physical aspect to his former armor
[1:03:08] Rikutochi: looks like a lee skill
[1:03:42] arthalie: Forced Kappa
[1:03:52] koushik_10: @arthalie where do u read all the lore from ?
[1:03:56] khoajsp: Who would you recommend to get as a coach?
[1:03:59] Toften69: Heey how are you
[1:04:10] Jantsche: Why pot in the jg?

[1:04:21] arthalie: Necrit
[1:04:23] Toften69: Im good ty
[1:04:55] arthalie: Go to Neace Kappa totally worth $200
[1:04:58] koushik_10: @khoajsp which role?
[1:05:18] lambchop24: @santorin yoric ghouls are low key broken in farming jungle camps any chance you think he can jungle?
[1:05:28] khoajsp: @koushik_10 jungle :D
[1:05:38] waynekerrishere: Wait, so you will play maokai jungle, but you won't try the most broken jungler in the game at the moment? Zilean
[1:05:51] arthalie: Man I'm so glad Kesha came back
[1:06:21] alanalda: haha
[1:06:58] Jantsche: the classic, 1 camp into 2 dying laners hahah
[1:07:12] arthalie: Man talon players are something else
[1:08:26] Noahhans: Noahhans subscribed with Prime. 
[1:09:16] waynekerrishere: But he will never give us cool rewards for our channel points #feelsbadman
[1:09:18] Noahhans: santorinLove  Never catch your stream but I finally did today. Been a fan since TSM days. SKAL
[1:09:19] waynekerrishere: streamer hates us
[1:10:15] Noahhans: Emote seems pretty fair
[1:10:18] bot1nant: jg maokai coming next patch
[1:10:33] DeathWaffle: Throw request Kappa
[1:10:49] waynekerrishere: Spend 10k channel points to lose this game
[1:10:50] ThePeePuddle: could do like a OP GG reviev for a good amount of points
[1:11:23] Noahhans: My gold ass would do better than jinx XD
[1:11:27] solidussovis: This song is perfect for what was going on there
[1:11:42] rvend: yoo my goat, how many champ left?
[1:12:56] ThePeePuddle: very fair
[1:13:06] Noahhans: True
[1:13:12] Sylik16: @Santorin was there a champ you were surprised at how good they were in jungle
[1:13:16] ThePeePuddle: LOL
[1:13:34] Caendred: Yeah I never understood why people value op GG reviews, it's really just non contextual data
[1:13:42] bambi__lol: it‚Äôs fine lyandires take over
[1:14:01] Dacker___: Teemo!
[1:14:35] jzipfel20: Ornn!!!
[1:14:44] Sylik16: lol no worries
[1:14:50] Dacker___: I think he was surprised by Teemo, even though he lost the game.
[1:14:54] S0GD: think he said mordekaiser earlier
[1:14:58] S0GD: to same question
[1:15:33] Sylik16: @S0GD ty
[1:15:35] rvend: what rhe next content after every champ in jugnle?
[1:15:40] lackmind9: The teemo definitely shocked me
[1:16:03] arthalie: I'm usually pretty surprised when I see ad shyvana nowadays since everyone goes AP
[1:16:25] imfl3x: can u climb with eve and Elise ?
[1:16:30] TheQuackleDK: Was ult needed there?
[1:16:33] Caendred: Teemo Jung is super good at taking camps I'm surprised it's not more popular. I feel jug is the role that utilizes his shrooms best
[1:16:57] Caendred: They gave him just specific buffs a while back
[1:17:04] Caendred: Jung*
[1:17:54] Noahhans: Lichbane first item Akali is sus no?
[1:17:59] arthalie: RoA maokai
[1:18:34] TheQuackleDK: But if you Q'ed before R is he still not dead even with flash? Just curious
[1:18:39] Caendred: @noahhans that's what's meta atm I think, I see every Akali do that
[1:18:58] arthalie: @noahhans it's pretty normal depending on playstlte now, especially after stormsurge nerfs
[1:19:04] Noahhans: @Caendred interesting, seems so taboo.
[1:20:06] imfl3x: when the last time you talk to bjersen
[1:20:22] Caendred: @noahhans why though? Akali damage source is for the most part her empowered autos from passive so combined with lich proc it's super strong. She's a hit and run champ so the 8%ms and CDR are also well utilized on her
[1:20:38] solidussovis: Mercy? your jinx has no hands is the bigger problem
[1:21:30] Noahhans: @Caendred Thats true. Mabye its because Lich is embeded in my head as a season 3 item with mana yarrBluh
[1:22:01] JuijitsuChicken: Even Galio is rushing LB now.  1k dmg from 1st auto with LB and passive
[1:22:26] Noahhans: @JuijitsuChicken I can get down with that. My old man hands can play galio
[1:23:09] Noahhans: So is fizz back then
[1:23:18] Noahhans: I want to troll pole
[1:23:28] arthalie: Haha they nerfed fizz instantly
[1:23:39] Caendred: Actually why isn't fizz Jung a thing?
[1:23:44] Noahhans: @arthalie Of course. Why wouldnt they
[1:24:04] Noahhans: I dont remember the last time i saw a fizz in Solo Q
[1:24:13] rvend: THIS YONE DIDNT READ HIS SKILL
[1:24:15] TheQuackleDK: JINX GOT A KILL
[1:24:20] TheQuackleDK: ITS JOEVER
[1:24:20] rvend: WHY HE DODGE WITH E
[1:24:36] rvend: nvm
[1:24:38] solidussovis: I want a clip of the Jinx having less damage then Emilio
[1:25:03] arthalie: I feel like fizz jg was a thing around the time tank fizz first popped up but I don't remember exactly
[1:25:21] TheQuackleDK: Trailblazer on support maokai is so good
[1:25:41] solidussovis: 3 item lethality spike
[1:25:52] Noahhans: Fizz is one of those champs where hes too fun so rito fucks him
[1:26:42] Northlane0: How we doing everybody.  Good morning, say it back.
[1:26:55] TheQuackleDK: back
[1:26:58] Noahhans: Good morning
[1:27:00] tugwos: it back
[1:27:09] Northlane0: @tugwos there it is LUL

[1:28:33] tugwos: Jinx didn't read her abilities either.
[1:28:39] JuijitsuChicken: Galio is really fun with LB
[1:28:51] JuijitsuChicken: rush Sorc into LB then build what you need
[1:28:57] minners15: i‚Äôm going to niagara falls this weekend üòé
[1:28:58] Noahhans: @tugwos Jinx has abilities  santorinQ
[1:29:53] Broitone: Broitone subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:30:07] tugwos: @Noahhans you can't be that bad without practice!
[1:30:08] noonifer: wtf akali deleted them
[1:30:36] Broitone: been watching everyday not even realizing my sub expired
[1:31:19] lackmind9: While we're in que, what is your most surprising jungler
[1:31:41] lackmind9: Wait till after ads to answer!
[1:31:45] arthalie: Would haunting guise into jaksho be solid? Then finish Riftmaker into full tank?
[1:31:56] Sunnytinker: ADS NotLikeThis
[1:32:46] Noahhans: No reason no rocket launcher there
[1:32:50] Trainee7: Ghost was on cd - no?
[1:33:14] Sylik16: Was teemo the answer @Santorin lol
[1:33:25] tugwos: teemo is always the answer
[1:33:26] Rodacon: @Trainee7 She ghosted by the tower I think
[1:33:28] helpmydogisaturtle: sup all
[1:33:33] Rodacon: after the play
[1:33:52] noonifer: teemo jg no balls
[1:33:57] Trainee7: Ye ye - spectator bug I guess
[1:34:16] Chazdongle: i think ornn
[1:34:20] arthalie: Legitimately might be a solid hybrid damage game so you have AP
[1:34:42] tugwos: Ornn was surprisingly good that game
[1:35:05] arthalie: I still play ap llbook sej and find a lot of success with it
[1:35:09] Sylik16: <3 preciate it
[1:35:16] arthalie: A lot of spellbook sej
[1:35:22] helpmydogisaturtle: theres a teemo otp jgl guy
[1:35:34] helpmydogisaturtle: teemojo or what his name
[1:35:46] CuteKittyBoi: I have a secret love for morg jungle
[1:35:46] tugwos: Manco in NA, Charles in EU
[1:35:47] Noahhans: What was it S5 ezreal Jungle was giga broken?
[1:35:51] Rodacon: These guys didn't play in S7...
[1:36:06] Noahhans: Ah
[1:36:26] Noahhans: Sheeesh
[1:36:36] Rodacon: The SSG Ezreal skin was for their jungle sub LUL
[1:36:40] arthalie: I just remember SKT playing it in groups at worlds that year, it was terrifying
[1:36:48] Rodacon: Apparently it had some item called Runeglaive before that which was mega OP though?
[1:36:49] helpmydogisaturtle: ez jg goes crazy lowkey
[1:37:25] arthalie: @rodacon runeglaive was mid lane smite ezreal, jg was ad and you essentially played it like Graves
[1:37:51] CuteKittyBoi: have you tried sett jungle at all?
[1:37:53] helpmydogisaturtle: try sort higher elo
[1:38:36] reflecteuw: kaisa? Susge
[1:38:42] Rodacon: @arthalie Was RG a one patch wonder type thing or was it annoyingly OP for a while?
[1:38:51] helpmydogisaturtle: for the ez jg winrate @santorin

[2:58:40] justcoup: dude's an absolute rumble enjoyer
[2:59:02] iiNumb3rz: Lol this started like 2 days ago didn't it?
[2:59:43] tugwos: I played a silver playing with over 2 million teemo points.  He played like a silver...
[2:59:45] solidussovis: Numberz gets it. We have been waiting through a literal 15 hours of stream waiting for this
[2:59:48] iiNumb3rz: Lol you probably have 5m mastery on sejuani in lcs alone
[3:00:06] arthalie: I remember the forbidden ez tech used to be scorc shoes lol
[3:00:08] DrogonBTW: no ward on raptors?

[3:01:35] dotherightthing7: GG EZ GAME
[3:01:40] solidussovis: Ez jungle not disappointing from minute 1
[3:01:46] oblivious33: The wait was worth it so far
[3:01:48] xgreatscottx: wait is ez just the best lvl 1 character in the game?
[3:02:20] arthalie: In theory I think ez senna is the highest DPS bot lane level 1
[3:02:24] Kimakaze: you made Janna what‚Ä¶
[3:02:27] akongen: u made janna come ? .. u dog
[3:02:39] iiNumb3rz: Safe to say I'll be first timing ezreal jungle in a ranked game tonight because I am very impressionable.
[3:03:10] Rodacon: Wow, a team actually let you play Ez
[3:03:15] opticdyno: terrain gap
[3:03:16] solidussovis: @iiNumb3rz I seen Santo do it so it must be meta now LUL
[3:03:24] noonifer: wtf a ez q just flew through my window
[3:03:33] iiNumb3rz: The difference is I'll type trust in chat before lol
[3:03:39] iiNumb3rz: And they'll all fall for it.
[3:03:53] xgreatscottx: would you not want to scuttle first since its a neutral objective?
[3:04:02] noonifer: only epics
[3:04:27] arthalie: Okay absolutely cursed, but do we just skip sheen and go eclipse black cleaver
[3:04:37] iiNumb3rz: @xgreatscottx I think cuz he gets 4 from camps then would be able to fight. Plus he had vision.
[3:04:38] solidussovis: scuttle jukes bro.
[3:05:06] Noahhans: Scuttles are best at jukes
[3:05:11] Noahhans: even get faker faked
[3:05:40] iiNumb3rz: Is Janna back up here? Tf
[3:06:01] solidussovis: 44 other players didn't want to be carried but Ez jungle
[3:06:07] LoudDerp: honestly, the last couple of lobbies seemed a lot worse for ez jungle.
[3:06:12] Noahhans: nah they losers
[3:06:23] solidussovis: by
[3:06:25] solidussovis: 8
[3:06:37] Mve_Ur_Bdy: Not losers just insecure LUL
[3:06:38] noonifer: spoke too soon
[3:06:42] iiNumb3rz: Well we all knew that wss coming
[3:06:51] svedigesvend123: Why dont you save your E for dmg on camps?
[3:07:34] Noahhans: Ruined tempo with tp
[3:08:24] LoudDerp: ankles broken
[3:08:26] solidussovis: agreed
[3:08:41] iiNumb3rz: Do you know the video where the nidalee invades the hecarim in pro play?
[3:08:47] iiNumb3rz: This is what that feels like
[3:10:36] LoudDerp: huge
[3:10:52] LoudDerp: but they stopped you from getting 5 grubbies :(
[3:11:19] noonifer: iceborn?
[3:11:35] Mve_Ur_Bdy: Is recurve not good?
[3:11:51] Noahhans: Recurve?
[3:11:57] Noahhans: the component?
[3:12:16] solidussovis: Zoned him to stop him from getting away. It didn't seem too bad. Could have been better
[3:12:32] landskildpadde: !rank
[3:12:35] Dntspeedup: santorin santorinWave santorinWave santorinLove
[3:12:51] xgreatscottx: you think blue build ez could be good again? muramana, iceborn, frozen, eclipse?
[3:13:05] SublimeSoul: trinity?
[3:13:09] Mve_Ur_Bdy: yeah, get on hit aoe dmg?
[3:13:13] hintIO: eclipse is red, so cant be blue build
[3:13:20] Noahhans: @xgreatscottx I tried it in Aram seemed kinda underwhelming
[3:13:25] RedMemma: ezreal bluebuild works in aram xD
[3:13:28] Mve_Ur_Bdy: or is it not aoe
[3:13:31] jzipfel20: Titanic!!!! become a big boy!
[3:13:42] Noahhans: @RedMemma They were all AD dive XD
[3:14:09] solidussovis: Santo just became Ez jungle OTP
[3:14:53] Velraptured: Tbf it's a Zac player, that champ inflates so much I doubt they did much 'thinking' at all
[3:15:13] Noahhans: Literally inflates too
[3:15:21] Sejstargazin: guys, my main is actually secret op right now with a certain build
[3:15:26] Sejstargazin: I havent felt that strong in so long
[3:15:28] Sejstargazin: maybe since 2021
[3:15:40] Noahhans: Man mains teemo
[3:15:41] Sejstargazin: I wonderh ow many champs are hidden op atm
[3:15:41] RavenTalk: careful he says
[3:15:41] xgreatscottx: "i need to be careful"
[3:15:46] xgreatscottx: drives rift to tier 2
[3:15:56] sebastianminiatures: morning boss o7
[3:16:11] Dntspeedup: santorinWave santorinWave santorinWave santorinWave
[3:16:40] solidussovis: I think Santo means he needs to be careful or they are FF soon
[3:17:34] RedMemma: or iceborn :D
[3:17:41] xgreatscottx: go iceborn for the mems
[3:17:42] solidussovis: Jungle gives you enough mana you don't need rreaver
[3:17:50] Kimakaze: @santorin Malphite next game? :)
[3:17:57] milkweed_love: essence if you have mana issues
[3:18:08] arthalie: I'd think essence so you can go lord dominiks, serlydas is kinda shit on ez now
[3:20:09] arthalie: Actually this would probably be a solid mortal renifrr game vs yone Zac, so trinity is probably the right choice
[3:20:26] arthalie: Reminder*
[3:21:20] Dntspeedup: that janna tornado LUL
[3:23:24] dotherightthing7: these galio ults are incredible

[3:24:57] LoudDerp: your team is too bloodthirsty. kda > objectives
[3:25:50] LoudDerp: looks like 5mill mastery points isn't enough to carry.
[3:26:21] morbidnumbskull: Mastery dont mean shit when macro is atrocious
[3:26:50] Dntspeedup: santorinHype santorinHype santorinHype
[3:27:13] TheCatcoon: Ok, now it is time for the round 2 with ezreal, to prove that really works @santorin
[3:27:54] iiNumb3rz: I'll first time ezreal jng tonight and we can all review my vod tomorrow
[3:27:58] iiNumb3rz: LUL LUL LUL
[3:28:13] Nct16: KEKW
[3:28:22] morbidnumbskull: Give them a lead and they throw it away
[3:28:39] Pock3tsand: that's just all toplane head games
[3:28:42] arthalie: Imagine if he'd been on gnar there
[3:28:53] ikesha99: MASTER ELO BTW LUL LUL LUL
[3:29:04] morbidnumbskull: Why arent ppl making tiktoks of Santorin explaining the 'What went wrong" parts of the game KEKW

[3:30:56] Blam____: jac
[3:30:58] Blam____: jax
[3:30:58] morbidnumbskull: He already played trundle... and HE LOST KEKW
[3:31:08] Kimakaze: Malphite would wreck rengar
[3:31:09] arthalie: Fleet or unsealed spellbook
[3:31:19] LoudDerp: how many champs left in the pool?
[3:31:20] Kimakaze: @santorin Malphite sir!
[3:31:24] morbidnumbskull: Fleet
[3:31:32] xgreatscottx: aftershock duh
[3:31:34] starkillertofu: phase works
[3:31:53] starkillertofu: approach scales on your ulti
[3:31:54] iiNumb3rz: Glacial augment or whatever kekw
[3:32:11] lackmind9: why phase rush for sion?
[3:32:24] starkillertofu: @lackmind9 he has no gap closer
[3:32:34] starkillertofu: so move speed or slows help him with ganks
[3:32:52] starkillertofu: most use phase or glacial
[3:32:55] milkweed_love: doesn't talon get steamrolled by tank azir
[3:32:59] arthalie: Ignite ghost swain is actually psychopath behavior
[3:33:06] hey_im_rabid: wow this song is not it
[3:33:07] kuronuo: what would tahm kench jungle be good against ?
[3:33:34] iiNumb3rz: You still have bel veth no?
[3:33:41] lackmind9: @starkillertofu glacial makes sense, but I feel like the 3 hits on phase means you're already in range
[3:33:51] arthalie: Belveth was earlier, I think that was the one loss
[3:34:11] arthalie: Or was the loss Mundo?
[3:34:35] iiNumb3rz: No he lost on someone else but idr who
[3:34:48] xgreatscottx: ooooo this is how you path when you start chickens
[3:35:10] i_am_bjork: i_am_bjork subscribed with Prime. 
[3:35:13] dotherightthing7: sion is one of fave champs for no reason
[3:35:23] arthalie: If anyone here needs free elo comet Sion top is actually back to being sleeper op
[3:35:28] starkillertofu: if you want to go cancer build you can build a seryldas and then you can force flashes with your passive in fights
[3:35:38] morbidnumbskull: Longship!!!
[3:35:56] rvend: @starkillertofu this seems so disgusting lmao
[3:36:31] arthalie: Top doesn't play akali, they played it so you'd have AP I think
[3:36:35] starkillertofu: @rvend the slow plus the move speed boost from phase its so funny
[3:37:13] morbidnumbskull: when in doubt and u need AP champ, why not just go Gragas or Karma top
[3:37:21] xgreatscottx: 204 hp btw
[3:37:42] oblivious33: Chadguy6pac
[3:37:57] milkweed_love: boots better than completing bami's cinder?
[3:38:00] iiNumb3rz: Is that rengar one trick guy on the euw server?
[3:38:26] iiNumb3rz: Pui or something
[3:39:37] arthalie: If this was SKT you'd stay between their turets and proxy with kalista
[3:41:36] morbidnumbskull: Swifties
[3:41:45] iiNumb3rz: Has there ever been a Meta where jng took tp?
[3:42:16] morbidnumbskull: @iiNumb3rz I wouldnt say meta but a few champs use TP, like Master Yi and Shaco
[3:42:41] morbidnumbskull: and then they stopped doin it
[3:42:47] Velraptured: Unending Despair ftw
[3:42:51] sebastianminiatures: its the comback song
[3:43:10] Vladheim_: Talon is allergic to mid lane CS
[3:43:10] arthalie: Closest I can think of was season 5, cinderhulk top laners like Sion and shyvana went to smite and would farm the enemy camps
[3:43:30] xgreatscottx: do you get hp from the grubbies grubs?
[3:44:04] arthalie: @xgreatscottx yes, but it's not worth farming them
[3:47:08] Velraptured: Your solos both have stealsh/diversion tactics, I seriously think unending despair goes hard here
[3:47:21] Velraptured: *stealth
[3:47:22] 0reosandmilk: yuumi jg challenge
[3:47:23] starkillertofu: herald next?
[3:47:30] Vladheim_: @Velraptured his solo share one brain cell, not worth banking on
[3:47:39] Vladheim_: solos*
[3:47:55] Mve_Ur_Bdy: Does Azir ult stop sion ult?
[3:47:59] Velraptured: @Vladheim_ That's even more reason to have it, the longer they don't focus and kill sion the more value unending despair has
[3:48:44] arthalie: @mve_ur_bdy if they time it right, it's not, it won't block the damage but if you buffer ult you can push him away, asir will still get stunned
[3:49:07] morbidnumbskull: @Mve_Ur_Bdy If the wall is already up, then sion will stop there, however the shoving animation will not stop sion if sion ult'd first
[3:51:23] starkillertofu: nice boomba
[3:51:33] hey_im_rabid: wow that akali comeback shes getting all the kills now
[3:54:00] Vladheim_: HOLY SHIT
[3:54:00] starkillertofu: akali is fed now
[3:54:02] morbidnumbskull: It's okay Akali fixed it
[3:54:07] Vladheim_: that rengar threw that so hard
[3:54:16] morbidnumbskull: Akali pressed Ctrl + Z on all your blunders in midlane KEKW
[3:54:27] KindKassadin: @Vladheim_ go rope it irl im not letting my bot win
[3:54:30] KindKassadin: get shot all of you

[3:55:50] starkillertofu: vayne with no items cant do shit
[3:56:00] JasonParkest2: if ur telling peopel to rope irl over any video game you should be in a padded room @KindKassadin
[3:56:03] xgreatscottx: i get up for 5 minutes and now akali is legendary and talon has a bounty???
[3:56:06] starkillertofu: swaina nd azir cant carry when rest of team is useless
[3:56:58] morbidnumbskull: Sion is a legit jungler ig

[4:05:47] arthalie: I just saw him go off on azir lol
[4:05:52] Silfel: He was flaming the whole world
[4:05:56] Praetor_GG: very typical rengar player tbh
[4:06:04] Chronexe: @Santorin Are you staying in Toronto right now ?
[4:06:25] Praetor_GG: they are all so angry and dim
[4:06:28] DocPhosis: was scrubnoob?

[4:24:11] starkillertofu: @Santorin do you know the malphite ulti trick? if your mouse is just over half way inside a wall you ulti over it makes your ulti a blink instead of a dash.
[4:24:21] xgreatscottx: jungling in solo queue is terrible. people expect you to be everywhere and help everyone all the time its obnoxious
