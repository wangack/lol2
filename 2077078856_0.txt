[0:37:45] dafakey: @naayil Youâ€™ve taught me Aatrox is my favorite character in league heâ€™s the only reason I play the game and ranked in general again
[0:37:55] martin_be3: does bullyng help with gameplay?
[0:38:01] lorena_da_glock: how so
[0:38:07] Aarguil: a rework?
[0:38:10] shadow_assiassin: make it slow be 85%

[0:38:25] reifortune: hey naayil howâ€™s it going just joined
[0:38:35] gabrielwasneverhere10: aatrox w slow should be as much of a slow as zillean's
[0:38:36] lorena_da_glock: i mean, nasus has 99% slow, i think they should increase the slow
[0:38:37] eisalt123: make it a microstun?
[0:38:42] chrono_ward: grinding KEKW
[0:38:54] gabrielwasneverhere10: what if it scilences?

[0:39:32] luisthemexican6: I want naayil to see humzh play aatrox too funny
[0:39:37] lorena_da_glock: yeah, his w is obsolete this season, too much movespeed

[0:40:24] godm3me_: @gabrielwasneverhere10 maybe too far
[0:40:33] terano77: rrip kindred
[0:40:40] jucaoemide: not at all naayil like dark jokes
[0:41:01] StarblastPiola: "W" is only to reduce the passive's cooldown by 3 seconds if it hits.
[0:41:09] i_i_sofia_i_i: Waiting in q for 10 years only to get a remake D:

[0:43:12] i_i_sofia_i_i: w useful , got the cannon
[0:43:28] gabrielwasneverhere10: Somehting that would make aatrox better is w insta kills all minion types exept super minions if it hits a minion.
[0:43:36] mrWhateverItwas: @i_i_sofia_i_i and 20 sec cooldown lol
[0:43:57] i_i_sofia_i_i: @mrWhateverItwas Cannons come more then every 20 seconds haha
[0:43:57] Noelletrox: i got auto filled and my ranged top laner said aatrox players are femboys lol

[0:51:41] Aargul: ryze with 5k hp normal build xd
[0:51:47] i_i_sofia_i_i: Does Jayce have high skill celling ? I kind of assumed Jayce is not that difficult to play
[0:51:51] trashboatxtd: close
[0:51:53] Dia_X9: sadge
[0:51:53] probablyShane: do you think there actually are any "balanced" champs in league rn?
[0:51:56] vedzoid: I mean that is kind of why Azir is spammed by most pros now
[0:52:11] vedzoid: he was way more niche before Season 9ish
[0:52:14] r1mpa1: @i_i_sofia_i_i 70% hard
[0:52:18] StarblastPiola: Would that also apply to Elise and Nidalee?
[0:52:39] naazurea: I think fought again jayce is more easy than fought agains Darius, like you know what i mean
[0:53:19] Roggygor: tolkin is the german goat

[0:56:47] longclaw19: bard for sure
[0:56:50] z3urnwi: azzap in team
[0:56:52] hrgneux: @tommmmmmassssss nah you can't say that, it's skilled to play

[0:57:23] movimientonaranjisimo: Dude, people love to make questionable questions FamilyMan
[0:57:23] gabrielwasneverhere10: the jayce was the result of a forbidden the union between the gas station bathroom whore and her twin brother
[0:57:27] bigdrakeloi: do you know azzap?
[0:57:29] z3urnwi: that'd pull before the nerf
[0:57:35] tommmmmmassssss: @hrgneux hell nah,jayce is basically all point and clicks u just need spacing like any champion in the game
[0:57:37] DexiD: I think people like to talk about other streamers cuz of they like collaborations.

[0:58:07] Nicholai_Deus: Always winnable, a velkoz otp said so Clueless
[0:58:11] gabrielwasneverhere10: we love to be mad
[0:58:15] zeph2k: syndra no scaling? XDDD
[0:58:33] gabrielwasneverhere10: kindrid scales amazingly
[0:58:43] tommmmmmassssss: @hrgneux ure coping
[0:59:00] pomorato1: Nayiil I hope you don't suddenly die because your stream is fire
[0:59:16] gabrielwasneverhere10: 5 MANNED

[0:59:41] i_i_sofia_i_i: Wait Jayce is really good late game while being a ranged lane bully -_-
[0:59:50] raivato: @zeph2k ??
[1:00:15] m1lawa: 2nD rune triumpf or resolve
[1:00:18] m1lawa: on comet ?
[1:00:19] HyperStarjj: why do u assume anyone talking to u is silver lol
[1:00:46] Brazenhat: Brazenhat subscribed with Prime. 
[1:00:48] i_i_sofia_i_i: Speaking of comet runes that you pick against Vayne / most ranged matchups , could you show it before the next game, I wish to screenshot it so I can play it when I end up going against ranged annoying champions
[1:00:53] hrgneux: @tommmmmmassssss just not delusionnal about champs. Yes Jayce is strong, no it's not "easy" to master at all.
[1:00:54] Star_night88: How do I crit 4 times in a row like a good Tryndamere player?
[1:00:55] martin_be3: lobotomy
[1:00:58] tommmmmmassssss: well akshually im E3
[1:00:59] cheerios20203: is the majority silver or platinum? one bracket was 30% but i forgot which one it was
[1:01:02] boko559: w
[1:01:04] Dia_X9: Am AcTuAlLy EmErAld
[1:01:09] jerome_diazzz: silver is a generous assumption tbh lmao
[1:01:10] dabsus: challenger at heatr Kappa
[1:01:12] probablyShane: how dare you assume their silver Naayil!!! they're actually bronze lmao
[1:01:14] bigdrakeloi: just a bad argument to say ayy you are low elo anyways
[1:01:16] jjk61: platinum is the new silver
[1:01:31] Rxiaer: what if grandmaster Kappa
[1:01:34] pomorato1: If you aren't top 1 challenger korea don't talk tobme
[1:01:37] TheArrir: Do you think comet lethality is good into ranged matches like Jayce or is it just comet with regular build
[1:01:41] andysilva100: what about masters?
[1:01:44] tommmmmmassssss: @hrgneux sure hes hard to master but not theres no way u think hes hard to be decent at
[1:01:44] i_i_sofia_i_i: Everything below masters is kind of low elo , he also did make arguments besides saying low elo
[1:01:50] i_i_sofia_i_i: He didn't just say low elo therefore you are wrong
[1:01:55] xxcrown_clownxx: theres no diference between emrald silver golddiamonf all are trash af
[1:01:59] Dia_X9: real question is why even bother to argue the moment he disagrees stop XD
[1:02:11] Nicholai_Deus: And still, many Diamond players have terrible takes about the game
[1:02:12] hrgneux: @tommmmmmassssss any champ is easy to be "decent at", you're just changing words now
[1:02:16] i_i_sofia_i_i: @Dia_X9 +1
[1:02:18] zeph2k: ok but ur not an adc player/
[1:02:18] cheerios20203: Btw since what i wrote 1.5 weeks ago it's been 1.5 weeks again and i am still masters. I suck big big time at this game. it's been a month and i can't get to grandmasters for the life of me.
[1:02:24] Jaynocide_1: NAAYIL

[1:02:44] bigdrakeloi: xdd
[1:02:44] eer3sh: is that lathyrus
[1:03:00] i_i_sofia_i_i: @Naayil May you please show what your comet rune page would look like if you played it ?
[1:03:01] tommmmmmassssss: @hrgneux no thats cap,u need like fucking 50 games of gp to not go 0/10 every game
[1:03:04] hrgneux: @TheArrir that is what i'd go for
[1:03:11] tommmmmmassssss: thats an example
[1:03:36] zeph2k: xd
[1:03:38] cheerios20203: you can straight up watch agurin's games and listen to him and his perspective on the game he literally explains almost everything related to jungle and how he plays the game.
[1:03:52] xxcrown_clownxx: it-s true
[1:03:55] phthagoras: most hard server?
[1:03:56] Nicholai_Deus: Naayil, would you rather have a Nidalee, or a Shaco?
[1:03:58] zeph2k: ok fair enough u done me, respect
[1:04:01] tommmmmmassssss: @cheerios20203 doesnt he stream in german?
[1:04:01] xeon77x: would you say your macro is on par with pro players?
[1:04:05] martin_be3: factos
[1:04:08] tommmmmmassssss: not everyone speaks german
[1:04:17] chicana798: basicly just trust him if u are low elo and when he says stuff he is sure about
[1:04:24] cheerios20203: @tommmmmmassssss he has tons of content in english as far as i know
[1:04:26] VioletNebula5: change skin please ^^
[1:04:42] Katan1377: prestige drx
[1:04:43] hrgneux: @tommmmmmassssss no, u can be "decent at" GP i don't take useless risks and play the scaling. But to be good at it, not "decent", you need a lot of training. That's the same for Jayce (but easier than GP), or Riven for example, but it's not easy escpecially at the elo Naayil is playing
[1:04:44] trashboatxtd: ezreal and jhin are fake adcs
[1:04:50] dabsus: nidalee is a conflip to me tbh...if you loose your jgl your fucked for the rest of the game and loose
[1:05:29] i_i_sofia_i_i: Also not all champions scale in the same way
[1:05:31] dafakey: dafakey subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:05:41] zeph2k: i get it, so if both teams are scaling, but they are ahead by a lot, it doesnt matter?

[1:06:10] BurnyTheDawg: u tied tekken 8 @Naayil ?
[1:06:11] gabrielwasneverhere10: yes
[1:06:12] cheerios20203: bard outscaled pyke but the others it was near impossible for them to outscale the others because of the lead enemy team had i think.
[1:06:13] i_i_sofia_i_i: @zeph2k I think that is the point he is trying to make + I think he says that their team scales harder then his team
[1:06:14] BurnyTheDawg: tried*
[1:06:19] Nicholai_Deus: Kindred became useless without the adc item with dash
[1:06:21] HyperStarjj: the black cleaver trinity build on kindried was busted
[1:06:27] Roggygor: wild times but than she got nerfed
[1:06:34] raivato: kindred don't build full crit this is why
[1:06:38] VioletNebula5: whats the easiest champ to defeat against aatrox?

[1:07:47] hrgneux: did they completely dropped the passive animation rework ?*
[1:07:48] Star_night88: Just slap Darius in the face and win
[1:08:09] dabsus: off to a good start, yes yes
[1:08:24] cheerios20203: which do you think is harder to climb to challenger one tricking or playing alot of champions? I am a two trick top laner and i am going to kms stuck masters for a whole god damn month. Do you have any advice for getting out of masters?
[1:08:29] i_i_sofia_i_i: @dabsus Could be worse
[1:08:36] cheerios20203: LOL
[1:08:43] i_i_sofia_i_i: I've seen him come back from worse
[1:08:59] gabrielwasneverhere10: supp is higher level than adc yikes

[1:21:02] tarqmeister: sett can win aatrox bruh
[1:21:02] i_i_sofia_i_i: @confus0sobrinho Revive was cool but being big with ult in a teamfight critting with your Qs just feels so cool
