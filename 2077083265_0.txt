[7:44:10] 514484: it would absolutely not be busted trust me
[7:44:50] jeromefrance: @514484 well, when teemo is viable or powerful he gets ban or picked. I prefer him''mow'' so we can play!

[9:38:44] kurufeemo: @ipav999 usually i go full ap after heartsteal, riftmaker, liandrys. It goes deathcap + 1 more ap item. Still 5000 hp late game and around 700 ap
[9:38:46] InterludetoPeace: @ipav999 i think with tank teemo being able to survive is better than damage
[9:38:53] Lazynameross: it needs to have a passive etc attached to be worth then
