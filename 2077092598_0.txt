[1:13:39] jimbob_ywert: it’s funny how Illaoi survived 3 patches with over a 54% win rate xd

[1:19:41] kreumbly: they need to buff tower damage so much lol
[1:20:01] kreumbly: champs being able to take like 19 towershots and their hp not moving
[1:20:04] Niomah: Some days it's just matchmaking and not a thing you can do about it
[1:20:10] jakabolta: do you like using word uwu?

[1:20:38] inSINwetrust: Than*
[1:20:45] Niomah: @CynicalScrub It was probably some high elo person smurfing
[1:20:55] Smoothcollie: People for some reason leave killing wards to supps. It's so stupid
[1:20:57] karinacappelli: brasil here kayy, you´re so cute <3
[1:21:17] kreumbly: Briar is still good, you just cant go assassin or full damage. have to go like tanky bruiser
[1:21:20] CynicalScrub: @Niomah i thought so, but 50% winrate overall in 96 games
[1:21:57] drakemore000: they had vision there
[1:22:13] Niomah: Not sure then. Maybe the rest of your team was horrible
[1:22:27] jimbob_ywert: If only had a frontline
[1:22:28] SquirrelMaster61985: but you scry bloomed there was no vision there
[1:22:29] Niomah: Or there wasn't a good counter to her on your team
[1:22:33] jexuzd: And as it wasn't strong enough the meele champions, lets let them to buy hurricane next patch :D, and apply on-hit effects yaaaaaaaay
[1:22:54] arcadedani: oh god xD
[1:22:59] Jaguar542: LUL unlucky
[1:23:07] DemionDemon: g`mornin``
[1:23:14] CynicalScrub: at least you took the cow with you
[1:23:20] Smoothcollie: Dragon is doing dragon things kaypAwkward
[1:23:21] ItsAMoll: just smolder things
[1:23:24] kreumbly: smolder late game damage is disgusting
[1:23:27] AllOfKingsPotato: TrollDespair
[1:23:27] DiscordLuck: Smolder took 7 tower shots
[1:23:32] Niomah: Yeah the next patch is going to just fully cement Riot just wants bruisers to win all the games
[1:23:35] DiscordLuck: WTAF
[1:23:43] evakp: wait no yall lost 😢
[1:23:46] jimbob_ywert: your team dying to smolders Q on you was so sad to see
[1:23:59] arcadedani: like we say yesterday...it takes just one wrong teamfight and all of a sudden you lost
[1:24:02] FiveFM: Wait WHAT!? We were totally winning! You know, I look away for ONE SECOND!  LUL
[1:24:11] CynicalScrub: ludens on steroids
[1:24:11] jimbob_ywert: what did kata build?
[1:24:19] MissUnfortuneK: She was exhausted in the last ult
[1:24:23] jakabolta: katarina was a bit too greedy emerald player buying death cap instad of buying void and it basicly makes her do 0 dmg
[1:24:25] shedfirekid1: I left to get lunch and come back to a loss what happened?!
[1:24:37] Niomah: Kat needed more MP
[1:24:40] satori890: nooo my sees?
[1:24:46] jakabolta: i feel like she biught it too late
[1:24:49] jakabolta: she was greedy
[1:25:03] jimbob_ywert: She went for more safe AP items than full burst ap
[1:25:06] jexuzd: Tank items Poooound
[1:25:09] DiscordLuck: Cheer100 Smolder took 7 tower shots on that last fight, he was amazingly tanky
[1:25:20] Sniipesttv: that’s why, no lich no void no shadow
[1:25:20] Smoothcollie: She diddnt have any magic pene  did she?
[1:25:21] arcadedani: yeah, that was a bad decision on your side because in that push it was probably game for your team
[1:25:35] kreumbly: nah he had a lot of hp items
[1:25:38] arcadedani: @Smoothcollie no just one shot items
[1:25:49] kreumbly: he had like 5 hp items
[1:26:13] FiveFM: Tank Smolder is a thing! Until they tweak his scaling you can build almost all tank items and still do the most damage in the game!
[1:26:55] arcadedani: yeah they took 2 shut downs there and then they take control of the game xD
[1:27:02] Niomah: She needed flat pen
[1:27:17] jimbob_ywert: like veigar smolder can just build tank cus he scales damage and execute
[1:27:34] arcadedani: was a sad ending :/
[1:27:57] Sniipesttv: ads? what are those?
[1:27:58] arcadedani: specially the smolder q i didn't knew that was a thing
[1:28:11] MissMeerkat: peepoArrive Hey friends! kaypFlower kaypHello
[1:28:13] AllOfKingsPotato: CatPls
[1:28:39] ObsceneSanity: unfortunate that the game didnt feel determined by matchmaking and it still turned out this way.
[1:29:12] Oakley85: The only big mistake was verbally saying you guys shouldn't lose this game earlier on lol. Jinxed it
[1:29:30] Smoothcollie: And u were heavy ap based team, u kata And Elise
[1:29:34] jexuzd: Wait a minute... I just noticed, How the hell will ad TF with new hurricane work? kaypFreya
[1:29:36] Lenox013: #balanced Kappa
[1:29:51] arcadedani: is stupid for real because all of a sudden the only ones doing damage were you and Elise
[1:29:53] jexuzd: Oh
[1:30:07] Hymuno: it was just a distraction because everything else is so broken Kappa
[1:30:08] valleyfrogs: Ever played sera?
[1:30:21] jexuzd: And the on hit is still going?
[1:30:26] quark978: good morning KayPea
[1:30:33] Oakley85: @KayPea Is that because of Master Yi?
[1:30:46] torge_154: @valleyfrogs ye, she did on Bot and Mid. Theres a YT Vid kaypFlower
[1:30:52] DemionDemon: thats Riot speak for "we done fvck up"
[1:30:52] exorc157: shyvana stacking her ult off 1 camp with runaan's in PBE looked silly
[1:30:54] giorgosplayslol: what i dont get is why there isnt any anti anti -cc items that would overpower effects like less time binded/stunned and stuff like that
[1:31:18] mxclavicles: riot is rioting you know
[1:31:19] quark978: quark978 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:31:21] Smoothcollie: Riooooot kaypShame
[1:31:25] arcadedani: riot is blind
[1:31:28] kreumbly: only melee should have tiamat items and only ranged should have runaans
[1:31:33] mxclavicles: riot is... is...
[1:31:36] Jaguar542: btw Smolder had 4 HP items
[1:31:38] giorgosplayslol: like if i play lux and one guy builds the me boots, my combo is gone
[1:31:39] quark978: oooo do I get a new badge for 6mo
[1:31:45] jexuzd: @oakley85 imagine braum applying passive to 3 people at once
[1:31:52] mxclavicles: I do believe that riot may have reached a point that they're just like "fuck it we ball" every patch
[1:32:11] jexuzd: So that broken it was
[1:32:41] Darkcyter: It's like when we used to have off days of school because of "Due to Unavoidable Circumstances..."  kaypLUL
[1:32:43] jimbob_ywert: pop star ahri!

[1:33:13] Darkcyter: @Jaguar542 @Smoothcollie @jimbob_ywert kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[1:33:18] jimbob_ywert: did you see how they made runaans hurricane usable for melee? imagine master yi.
[1:33:39] Smoothcollie: @darkcyter Hey fam kaypHello Hope u're doing good kaypFlower
[1:33:43] mxclavicles: sneaky has said that he feels there are more items than ever before that provide bonus damage amount, not like just adding base stats that increase your damage. Like storm surge adding that random ass 100~ damage after casting an ability or something
[1:33:58] mxclavicles: idk if that's true but I thought it was an interesting point
[1:34:03] via_trita: song goes hard
[1:34:49] darjar12: hii
[1:35:01] Cybraniac: Why is Ahri orb invisible?
[1:35:02] pandathejack: I was gone did you win last game?
[1:35:03] jexuzd: And some of them have pretty high base stats
[1:35:24] Cybraniac: Lol her hand is empty is that a bug?
[1:35:27] Smoothcollie: @cybraniac League of bugs kaypWHAT
[1:35:49] arcadedani: riot loves tanks i guess
[1:35:51] jexuzd: Yooo for real, just noticed
[1:35:55] mxclavicles: as you've said, there's such a huge amount of damage in the game that it seems even challenger games are turning into aram. I wish they'd just base buff the games damage right now as they do damage control to fix shit, so we can have more time for making actual plays and strategies, rather than getting caught out and one shot every two seconds.
[1:35:58] Cybraniac: That's it no q max this game cause she doesn't have it Kappa
[1:36:11] quark978: me playing ahri: "where'd my mana go"
[1:36:31] Smoothcollie: kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe

[1:38:01] RefresherGaming: im chilling sorry i stole ur duo XD
[1:38:02] mxclavicles: queue Santorin saying "jungle so op guys"
[1:38:47] jexuzd: I wonder if people will play solo adc on mid and the mage with the support on bot cuz the state of some mages
[1:39:23] hdthecrusaders: Can your q and e animation overlap
[1:39:24] RefresherGaming: SHE QUESTION THE AUDCITY
[1:39:28] Niomah: Lol she won't be amused when you start wrecking her turret
[1:39:30] jimbob_ywert: she’s underestimating the OP sleeper runes..
[1:39:40] quark978: she wouldn't have noticed the demolish if you hadn't managed to proc it, just sayin
[1:40:03] RefresherGaming: hows the eu servers been

[1:40:44] pandathejack: kp, what if your favorite Ahri skin!?
[1:40:46] mxclavicles: it's ok now it's the 0/2 power spike you know

[1:42:44] Napskee: hey everybody. how are the games going today?
[1:42:59] RefresherGaming: all depends on ur play style tbh
[1:43:05] RefresherGaming: dont always go off strong picks
[1:43:06] Niomah: Karma is great if you want to roam as a support
[1:43:07] DemionDemon: but Karma is kinda permabanned.
[1:43:15] KarolHeyaime: you never play spirit blossom ¿you dont like it?
[1:43:16] T_Ravenous: Karthus support Kappa
[1:43:21] BartonLua: rakan if you like being aggro

[1:44:41] jimbob_ywert: WHERES UR ORB
[1:44:50] LightManami: heyo
[1:44:55] jexuzd: The amount of damage in the game also get rid of the 1v5 carry potential
[1:44:59] mark__yeahhh: heeey🩷
[1:45:10] quark978: imma be optimistic and assume that was brands (poor) way of asking for a gank
[1:45:10] Niomah: Hi Orianna, how bout that demolish now?
[1:45:17] RefresherGaming: its a visual bug

[2:30:10] starkillertofu: gwen doing 70% hp with only an ulti skill

[2:32:38] callmesky__: hello! c:
[2:32:58] starkillertofu: i think it was season 7 when riot said that they didnt want a balanced game they want certain champs to be popular
[2:33:11] pandathejack: they need to lower the damage on all tank items. maybe that would do something?
[2:33:14] starkillertofu: problem is the list hardly changes
[2:33:28] RoyalKovn: thats why camille support is so fun :D
[2:33:29] Env_KO: yerrrrr
[2:34:17] BiSettual: She almost lived with that healing

[2:35:04] FIurbz: @temojay you shouldn't hate, thats mean, shes just trying to live her life.
[2:35:07] mattress_wolf: filthiest support is sona. no one steals more kills
[2:35:13] callmesky__: wait what camille support?

[2:35:56] Surfiction_: playing against that champ as a tank is so frustrating
[2:36:03] shedfirekid1: ezreal wasnt terrible
[2:36:10] RoyalKovn: Zoe is way harder to play as supp
[2:36:25] callmesky__: i mean yea cami is op i play her but camille support? i should try that out LUL
[2:36:37] psyhew: what do you think of the new dev video?
[2:36:45] lausteen: hiiiiiiiiiiiii hope u have a great day :) !
[2:37:02] shedfirekid1: right there with you, been killing it and still lose games just like you did with 2-3 people flaming or running it down
[2:37:25] TheLiin: losers q dont exist :D
[2:37:32] shedfirekid1: I am now right where riot wants me at 50% WR and losing more LP than gaining
[2:38:26] ViragS: i was in a losers q in plat for a month but im out now, so theres light at the end of the tunnel for u aswell

[2:39:42] lausteen: op gg just makes onces mode so good after that
[2:39:50] S17Master: I suspect loser's queue is an unintentional effect of the matchmaking algorithm that Riot themselves don't understand.
[2:39:54] psyhew: they’re saying negative LP gains happen for a short period of time *sassy eye roll*
[2:40:20] shedfirekid1: yupppp
[2:40:26] Smoothcollie: Have u thought about making a new acc?
[2:40:29] mxclavicles: twitch keeps saying my prime subscription will "be available February 29th" and it's not available yet XD XD XD

[2:41:36] tronofcool: the biggest lose streak I had was 6/7 but I also had plats, golds, and silvers in the same game
[2:41:44] GorillazNtheMyst: can't go on loss streaks if you just don't play season 14 eevoHuehue
[2:41:55] Breidaia: I quit League because of the losing, and the even more toxic vibes in it. like ick.
[2:42:18] psyhew: i started last night with 0 LP. went 4-2 and ended the night with 22 LP 😭
[2:42:21] jkkzone: went from emerald 3 to gold 2 literally don’t want to play this game anymore
[2:42:31] shedfirekid1: yeah this season is undeniably the worst in league history for matchmaking
[2:42:36] mxclavicles: @GorillazNtheMyst same same I haven't played ranked in weeks and I don't think I'll go back till next split or season
[2:42:40] shedfirekid1: @jkkzone I can’t imagine
[2:42:42] Smoothcollie: So 9 nuggets in the big menu, with strawberry milkshake and lotus big ice cream, thank you very much kaypHappea
[2:42:45] Darkcyter: @KiloJar WB

[2:42:53] Darkcyter: @Breidaia kaypHello
[2:42:59] jimbob_ywert: I’m so hungry for granola bar
[2:42:59] mikeyyoxo: i saw erick dota go on like a 10+ game loss streak  just a few days ago its actually horrible
[2:43:03] KiloJar: @Darkcyter kaypCheer
[2:43:07] shedfirekid1: @kaypea prediction reminder!
[2:43:07] edooby: @KayPea as someone who has seen the matchmaking code, losers queue isnt a real queue
[2:43:12] mxclavicles: @psyhew so you were positive 2 games but had only one game of lp kaypFlower
[2:43:13] Smoothcollie: Oh shit, it's fizz. Bleh kaypAwkward
[2:43:45] himawaril2: pichuPlead pichuPlead
[2:43:49] FIurbz: League is honestly the least toxic game if you type /deafen at the start of every game.
[2:43:56] S17Master: Phroxzon was absolutely trying to do damage control. The funny part is then they proceeded to tweet a super long "git gud" as if that was proof against loser's queue existing. Instead of, you know, actual evidence.
[2:44:13] mxclavicles: @jkkzone I thought you couldn't drop out of plat?? am I wrong?
[2:44:22] nassimiheb: Logs to league, plays aram, cloese league, sleeps happily
[2:44:34] Napping_Sab: oh no this yellow chroma is not my vibe on kai'sa
[2:44:36] jimbob_ywert: I need some advice- I trust you- Zoe is VERY hard to play and I feel like I’m being held back in gold because I focus on micro and macro when playing her… is it worth to play an easier mage to climb? or should I stick to Zoe because I have most fun with her and just gradually get better?
[2:44:38] ItsAMoll: Tyler1 is something like 2 and 18 in his last 20 games LOL
[2:44:52] FIurbz: @KayPea Prediction
[2:45:01] ruineddarha: you should have taken star guardian as well so you match LOL
[2:45:06] Oakley85: @KayPea I find the worst thing lately is the amount of times I have players that play like trash and I look at their match history and they just carried x games before and then lost their fingers when they are in my games
[2:45:34] S17Master: @ItsAMoll Holy shit
[2:45:41] psyhew: i went from d4 to e4 and it’s so depressing
[2:45:52] traemblz: i blame elo inflation
[2:45:53] ballzagna1: i finished plat 4 last season, started gold 3. dropped to silver 2 and finally got back to gold 4
[2:45:59] Aisu_Nieve: This season is my first season playing ranked. So far I played 8 games and lost all of them. Despite me losing all my placement games I still got gold 3. And I have no idea how riot is thinking that my bad performance is worthy of gold
[2:46:02] Hymuno: for this season you may as well make it 1st team to 30 kills
[2:46:08] ribas__11: silver elo is kinda crazy atm, even smurfing
[2:46:23] dalig_: @ribas__11 true
[2:46:26] jimbob_ywert: Kat did 0 damage that late game, don’t know if it was winnable
[2:46:52] mxclavicles: @Aisu_Nieve my friend played 1 placement game. Ran it down as Garen, went 0/8, he said he played horribly. They lost. He got placed plat 1. He was gold 3 the last season. Only one placement game
[2:46:53] bugzy__lol: 230 fps while streaming , please what is your PC Specs ?
[2:47:30] FIurbz: I was emerald last season, now I cant get above gold 3, I'm playing well, team just constantly throws.
[2:47:32] shedfirekid1: @ribas__11 even when I hard carry my team runs it down in silver atm, it’s worst I’ve ever had in this elo
[2:47:34] traemblz: bet that fizz regrets his choice lmao
[2:47:36] S17Master: @ribas__11 But why are you smurfing Silver?
[2:47:39] Aisu_Nieve: @mxclavicles It´s so weird.
[2:47:42] yanjii: hello kp! im sick so finally i found some strength to turn on pc and hang out!

[2:48:52] FreeXe: Yea we had that yesterday in Quebec
[2:48:54] 1ittle3: thunder snow sounds pretty metal
[2:48:58] its_clamor: could you explain the importance of stacks?
[2:49:00] Axohne: yeah that was yesterday it was like 15 c in the morning then started snowing in the afternoon
[2:49:00] ribas__11: @S17Master bc I only play diamond when I feel like it, but I have faced a lot of smurfs or people that went down 2/3 ranks in a silver acc
[2:49:01] Angelyc: northern ontario is a mess rn went from hot to ran to ice to snow now its sunny again
[2:49:03] Angelyc: HELP
[2:49:07] nassimiheb: Thunder snow, what's that
[2:49:25] via_trita: yeah, the swings are horrible in NA, from 90F to 35F the other day
[2:49:26] shedfirekid1: rakan double assist bot then killed you lol
[2:49:27] meep_: I think Rakan got the kill on you, no?
[2:49:28] dalig_: sounds pretty cool tho
[2:49:34] ArclightStorm: Kelsie, why does your map look odd like cant see you go into jung ?
[2:49:48] Aisu_Nieve: @mxclavicles My friend plays better than me since they play the games for over 3 years now while I started playing league more actively in summer last year. So all things considered they would deserve my rank more than I do XD
[2:49:55] Cut_n_Run: there is a map cover @ArclightStorm
[2:50:03] TuckstheRulesLawyer: it was more north of the city than TO last light. We didn't get much yesterday in the city, but one of my officers is up in Horseshoe and got 10 cm of snow last night
[2:50:16] jimbob_ywert: That was a really good Q he didn’t expect to react in time
[2:50:18] sequelsarenotcanon: @ArclightStorm in case of stream snipers to hide jgler
[2:50:32] jimbob_ywert: what rune did he take?

[2:53:11] its_clamor: what is the importance/usage of stacks?
[2:54:33] S17Master: @its_clamor Dark Harvest gives bonus damage when she hits a champion below 50%, and more stacks she gets, the more bonus damage
[2:54:35] Hymuno: you can see how much damage its done on the top left of her runes
[2:54:43] Hymuno: so 85 deeps so far
[2:55:06] its_clamor: oh okay! that makes sense, thanks!
[2:55:06] via_trita: dont forget them wards, cappin stacks XD

[2:57:57] sir_coughy: I hate that champ
[2:57:59] via_trita: because you died before it hit

[3:01:15] FreeXe: This song makes me feel like when I used to go clubbin 10 years ago
[3:01:42] himawaril2: is there any difference using an skin or a base skin for the last hit on minions? the visual atk speed or the animation that makes you feel confortable farming well or not so good often?
[3:02:00] mxclavicles: I won't lie fizz is one of those champs I wouldn't mind if they just removed from the game. Master Yi and Xerath are some others XD
[3:02:31] mxclavicles: sorry fizz, yi and xerath fans they just have caused me one too many tilts

[3:04:40] himawaril2: chubsNotes chubsNotes amedollNoted
[3:05:09] mxclavicles: @sexlogy yeah the lack of counterplays with yi q, fizz untargetability, and xerath hitboxes being dumb and global ult like if they just adjusted these things it'd be a lot better

[3:42:15] RaynKire: Fizz and Shaco the most annoying to catch and will waste your time trying 99 times out of 100
