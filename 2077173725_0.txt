[0:59:00] Ninosai: @nexmalin Do you have an idea what you want to do after school? Like work or some higher education?
[0:59:08] Nightbot: Rules: First do not harass other members of chat.  There is a limit on caps so dont use caps lock. Dont spam emotes. Don't spam commands, they are here for fun not to flood the chat.  NO 'back seat gaming' Kaif will play how he wants to play, unless he ask for help.  A mod voice is final, if they ask you to stop; you will stop.  When playing social deceit games if you have an assumption make it clear. Finally dont be a fucking cunt. kaifGrr kaifGrr
[0:59:22] Witch_Shaelyn: Flower power Zyra
[0:59:36] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[1:00:04] nexmalin: @ninosai nope, I am good at art, I like science, I can tolerate math, I don’t like people, so I’m just kinda stuck, I’m thinking psychology tho
[1:00:04] Witch_Shaelyn: Wheeeeey
[1:00:30] Witch_Shaelyn: Sooo much gold off that turret
[1:00:34] Fumbling101: @nexmalin There's a lot of tools and support out there for you, ADHD is the most well understood neurodivergence we're aware of. With some help you can learn to manage it
[1:00:51] Witch_Shaelyn: awwww close
[1:01:09] hotswitchexe: @nexmalin As someone with ADHD and currently studying in uni, medication has helped me pay attention in classes a lot. I also use music for dopamine control, it helps me concentrate when the brain isn't dopamine deprived
[1:01:18] Witch_Shaelyn: Ngl I really liked Cryptbloom
[1:01:18] nexmalin: yeah I’m on a heavy dose of concerta, because my ADHD makes me exhausted
[1:01:38] Fumbling101: @hotswitchexe I wish I was on meds when I was in uni, would've been a lot simpler xD I find cold showers also helps load with dopamine management!
[1:02:02] nexmalin: @hotswitchexe yeah I’m on a whole pile of medication
[1:02:02] hotswitchexe: @Fumbling101 My autism makes cold water painful LUL so I can't use that unfortunately
[1:02:06] Witch_Shaelyn: LOL he thought he could get over that wall xD
[1:02:24] AussieConvict: smacked him mid leap
[1:02:27] TDesius: Are you bullying Zyra? LUL
[1:02:29] Fumbling101: @hotswitchexe ah mate that sucks - A hot shower can still help with finding your center at least!
[1:02:33] SR_Willjar: @nexmalin aye. and having the lack of support and day-to-day structure of school will not help you when you're in further education
[1:02:39] Witch_Shaelyn: Zyra deserves it Desius kaifW
[1:02:43] GlordNH: kaif playing league? Pog
[1:02:44] hotswitchexe: @nexmalin I'm personally very sensitive to meds, so a smaller dose of Medikinet affects me for 8 hours
[1:02:45] SR_Willjar: so best to learn hopw to do it now and not when you're struggling
[1:03:03] Ninosai: Have you considered looking into manual jobs? Maybe you'd find something where you'd feel more comfortable or more passion with? Not necessarily laying bricks or whatever, unless you like that kaifW But maybe if studying books and shit doesn't work for you, finding something where you use your mind and hands rather than just store information would help. You could always look into short stages or small jobs @nexmalin
[1:03:53] Witch_Shaelyn: I have completely zoned out about what chat was talking about I see
[1:04:16] nexmalin: @hotswitchexe I’m on lots of meds that both help and drag me down a lot, I’m on sertraline which is an SSRI, so it makes very numb at times
[1:04:26] FighterPilot687: Howdy Kaif, how are you doing today HeyGuys
[1:04:50] Witch_Shaelyn: MF got them the zoomies
[1:04:53] Ninosai: The problem is, if you don't have a direction in life, or a passion, or something you're actually interested in, higher education will often mostly feel like a chore that you're not going to want to put effort into.
[1:05:18] Witch_Shaelyn: F
[1:05:20] Fumbling101: ssri + methylphenidate for me as well \o/ Fortunately my psychiatrist believes in micro-dosing rather than just taking loads of meds, so eventho I'm a big boi I'm on the smallest dose and it's doing wonders
[1:05:30] AussieConvict: kaif your too thicc
[1:05:58] Witch_Shaelyn: 36 v 36 y'all are entirely tied npw
[1:06:05] nexmalin: @ninosai yeah those jobs would be nice but I have a lot of body issues, like really bad hyper mobility, so a lot of jobs with manual labour have a possibility of hurting me, especially because I have a bad tendency to push myself too hard
[1:06:22] Witch_Shaelyn: Close game
[1:06:26] hotswitchexe: @nexmalin The numbness and exhaustion from my own meds was a major inhibitor for my studies, until I lowered the dosage which helped me regain my energy. I'd recommend talking to your doctor about treating that if you plan on going to higher education, as the lack of energy will be a big issue
[1:06:28] Fumbling101: @Ninosai This so much - I went to uni with a friend to study something he really wanted, thinking I wanted it too and it just never clicked for me. Ended up wasting half a year >.<
[1:07:14] Witch_Shaelyn: Damn close
[1:07:16] scarlettx_: @nexmalin i work as a security guard i react to alarms and check buildings, you do not need to learn a lot and its not hard on my body also.
[1:07:30] hotswitchexe: Chat's right, you need to have a plan on what you want out of higher education before entering it, especially if you are in a country with high tuition fees
[1:08:04] nexmalin: @hotswitchexe mhm, but the issue is that too low of doses can seriously impact my anxiety and depression and that’ll then affect my energy
[1:08:42] Dawholybirch: league stream again? time for another long haul lol
[1:09:06] ItsMwindo: Nice, a league stream, hope I didn't miss anything good
[1:09:12] nexmalin: @scarlettx_ that could be good, but i need to do more research before
[1:09:29] hotswitchexe: @nexmalin sounds like a catch 22. You definitely need energy in order to concentrate on uni lectures and assignments, so if a constant lack of energy proves to be an issue, then a career path that doesn't require it might be the wisest option.
[1:10:05] scarlettx_: @nexmalin there a lots of diffrent things you can do as a security guard :) can also menage camera's.
[1:10:07] Ninosai: I wasted 3 years in uni trying 3 different paths, because my parents told me "you have to go to uni" when I'd wanted to step away from higher education and find work in something I felt comfortable. @nexmalin I'd still suggest you take the time to look into things that you like. Don't just fixate on going for higher education just because that's what everyone says you have to do if you're just going to go for something where you're going to try and coast by. Try to find what you want to and can
[1:10:11] hotswitchexe: Also, medication is super personal, what worked for me will most likely not work for you, for that you'd need to consult a professional
[1:10:11] cupworth: Sure Kappa
[1:10:48] nexmalin: @hotswitchexe yeah we really need to find out what wrong with me before I go to uni
[1:10:53] Witch_Shaelyn: Deathcap time
[1:10:57] Ninosai: Also there are tons of way to learn things online and try out if some stuff click for you or not
[1:11:08] Fumbling101: @nexmalin Consistent therapy/counseling can help mitigate a lot of your struggles
[1:11:12] Witch_Shaelyn: kaifBork
[1:11:18] fabulousemperor: kaifBork kaifBork
[1:11:21] hotswitchexe: @nexmalin if you think that's the right path for you, then go ahead, but there are other options as well
[1:11:32] Ninosai: And you don't need to go to uni right out of high school LUL These days it's fine to go to uni a few years after High school
[1:11:33] Witch_Shaelyn: Got 2 of them Very low
[1:11:39] Witch_Shaelyn: Yoooooooo
[1:11:42] TDesius: Oh no
[1:11:44] nexmalin: @ninosai online work could be good

[1:11:47] TDesius: He attacked Gromp for health
[1:11:48] TDesius: LUL
[1:11:52] Fumbling101: Yeah it's pretty common to take a few years of sabbatical to just explore the job market - get some experience and try stuff
[1:12:06] ItsMwindo: Gromp clapped his cheeks? LUL
[1:12:13] Ninosai: Yeah online work is more and more of a possibility these days
[1:12:24] nexmalin: I probably will considering how hard uni impacted my sister mental health
[1:12:31] Witch_Shaelyn: Sadge
[1:12:40] ItsMwindo: kaifW
[1:12:59] Fumbling101: Gotta go lurk - Good luck with your exams @nexmalin !

[1:59:20] TDesius: Bard is great
[1:59:20] barloochlan4: @hotswitchexe all of them
[1:59:28] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[1:59:48] hotswitchexe: @barloochlan4 true, but consider: Bard Bard
[1:59:59] hotswitchexe: just for the name LUL
[2:00:13] barloochlan4: @hotswitchexe im a pink astronaught bard guy myself

[2:01:54] TDesius: He would like this "Hear me out"
[2:02:01] ProfesssorZilla: NotLikeThis
[2:02:03] Witch_Shaelyn: xD
[2:02:31] Sh1ven: @SR_Kaif 4 ranked games today with zyra jungle on enemy team......
[2:02:32] ItsInksy: And if it's white it's true damage
[2:02:54] ItsInksy: Because champions have true damage for some reason 4Head
[2:02:56] TDesius: But wait
[2:03:03] TDesius: it's not Runaan's Yi yet
[2:03:05] TDesius: LUL
[2:03:07] thehighborn: you just made every lane worse with that death Kaif :D
[2:03:07] ProfesssorZilla: white is best damage

[2:03:23] TDesius: Not that i'm aware of
[2:03:28] hotswitchexe: oh god
[2:03:36] ItsInksy: Runaans is hilarious with Illaoi as well
[2:03:40] Witch_Shaelyn: That was weird
[2:03:41] ItsInksy: Her tentacles proc it
[2:03:46] hotswitchexe: I hope that this Yi doesn't know the interaction
[2:03:58] hotswitchexe: because otherwise this is going to s u c c
[2:04:03] Witch_Shaelyn: Runaan's works on melee characters? kaifHmm
[2:04:11] TDesius: Next patch Shae
[2:04:16] thehighborn: i have had some succes on occasion with jamming scuttles into the walls
[2:04:23] hotswitchexe: Oh thank fuck
[2:04:24] Witch_Shaelyn: That sounds like a fucking awful idea
[2:04:28] TDesius: It sounds great
[2:04:38] TDesius: I have no Bias in this I swear
[2:04:39] TDesius: LUL
[2:04:49] Witch_Shaelyn: Melee getting bows. makes sense to me kaifW
[2:05:01] hotswitchexe: Runaan's Yi triggers his passive and Q cdr multiple times, reducing his Q cooldown to 1 second in late game
[2:05:03] TDesius: But Shae it's Bownus damage
[2:05:15] Witch_Shaelyn: Doesnt justify it Desius
[2:05:20] Witch_Shaelyn: Your puns cant sway me
[2:05:22] hotswitchexe: it's uninteractive and has essentially no counterplay
[2:05:23] darkkrusty: wish I still played LoL, would try to stream snipe Kaif just so I could make a jojo reference "Ho? you're approaching me?" kaifKEK
[2:05:57] Witch_Shaelyn: imaigne playing League kaifW

[2:09:09] thehighborn: but at least he is not a crook
[2:09:10] TDesius: I feel like everytime someone throws shade at Yasuo it's partially aimed at me these days LUL
[2:09:29] ProfesssorZilla: have the sr members played any of larian games together?
[2:09:40] Witch_Shaelyn: I mean Yasuo ain't shit so I dont bitch about him Desius kaifW
[2:09:57] ProfesssorZilla: sadge
[2:10:01] trevisto: that was a clean smite tbh
[2:10:37] ItsInksy: Champions being untargetable sure is a fun mechanic Kappa
[2:10:54] trevisto: yeah, smiting while stunned is bullshit as well :/
[2:11:18] ProfesssorZilla: Gwen Kappa @toymoth
[2:11:35] ItsInksy: Gwen single-handedly made me stop playing Illaoi
[2:11:54] ProfesssorZilla: I hate Gwen
[2:12:04] TDesius: Unbench the Kench
[2:12:13] ProfesssorZilla: she made me change from top to jungler
[2:13:35] TDesius: "Gwen is immune"
[2:13:51] ItsInksy: @TDesius STOP! You're giving me flashbacks!
[2:14:06] TDesius: But Gwen is immune
[2:14:20] ItsInksy: NotLikeThis
[2:14:21] Witch_Shaelyn: I dislike Gwen as Vel'koz kaifW

[2:17:29] TDesius: Nia is genuinely new
[2:17:30] TDesius: LUL
[2:17:56] thehighborn: well Nia is playing the most noob friendly role imo then
[2:18:25] Metrobiggie: wombo combo
[2:19:08] thehighborn: malphit yasuo moakai is a combo of my nightmares
[2:19:35] iwicsyG: @thehighborn dont forget orianna :)
[2:19:38] Witch_Shaelyn: I miss Twisted Treeline

[2:22:38] thehighborn: i have had Yone support and Yas carry in botlane and stomped hard as Ashe support with Ez carry
[2:23:34] ProfesssorZilla: Gwen can become immune to most of your attacks if that’s your duo
[2:23:38] ItsInksy: Uhm, ackshually, he's a catfish, not a frog Nerdge
[2:23:52] thehighborn: @ProfesssorZilla i dont duo i solo queue
[2:24:01] ProfesssorZilla: ah ok
[2:24:24] thehighborn: most people i know in league are either not bothered with playing ranked or i dont trust in a ranked setup :D
[2:24:48] ProfesssorZilla: ok pick your misery
[2:24:53] iwicsyG: @thehighborn facts
[2:25:00] ProfesssorZilla: enemy kha six or enemy rengar
[2:25:40] thehighborn: out of like 10 people i know that plays league quite regularly i trust 2 of them
[2:25:47] ItsInksy: Is Kha'Zix still busted?  I know he's been strong for like, 7 seasons now but he never gets nerfs
[2:26:00] TDesius: That Kench is doing his job perfectly
[2:26:06] thehighborn: nice
[2:26:11] thehighborn: well done guys
[2:26:27] ProfesssorZilla: idk for others, but every time he’s on the enemy team against me, he always one shot our adc and sup
[2:26:39] Witch_Shaelyn: Mr. Tahmas Kench is fed af kaifW
[2:26:49] ItsInksy: Tahmathy Kenchington III
[2:26:55] thehighborn: a fed Tahm on a good player is a disaster
[2:27:27] ItsInksy: I'm genuinely surprised Riot hasn't removed Kench's on-hit magic damage yet
[2:27:52] thehighborn: making a kench player on your team fed game generally jsut over

[2:34:52] TDesius: Bard is such a fun character
[2:35:01] Kusahri: with the passive it could be fun
[2:35:08] TDesius: I got yelled at so much for playing him support during the "Non roaming" support era of league
[2:35:12] xFoxicity: xFoxicity subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:35:30] thehighborn: @ToyMoth Leona jungle you need 1-2 succesfull ganks in the frst 6-8 minuts otherwise you are screwed but if you succed you become a menance... i have a rune setup for it
[2:35:42] iwicsyG: 2 flashes from them, cait and sera

[2:38:08] SweetEnchi: @TDesius what about neeko?
[2:38:11] Ninosai: LUL I'm saying you never heard of her cause she ignored you, bad joke
[2:38:16] thehighborn: hmm i have had a standard wolf since i s tarted in league in 2018
[2:38:26] TDesius: Neeko is a heathenous swine that needs to be removed from the game LUL

[3:34:32] Ninosai: Not as useful
[3:34:49] nearquaad: my bf has like 3 ahri statues he has a problem
[3:35:13] Ninosai: @nearquaad Indeed. Clearly his problem is finding more space to get more kaifW

[3:45:46] sattiex3: playing bard with sound on is  a sign someone is a maniac
[3:46:48] Witch_Shaelyn: I dont see the issue with sound on bard
[3:46:59] Kanjin04: @rhymegirlsatan Or a conosseur
[3:47:24] TDesius: That the true maniac for sounds is playing URF as Sona and Seraphine LUL
[3:47:48] Witch_Shaelyn: I play sound on DJ Sona Urf

[3:50:08] ItsInksy: Does Nia not know that fighting is in his blood?  Well, goo.
[3:50:13] Kusahri: no Kaif, you do not need Baron. You need more Meeps
[3:50:13] Witch_Shaelyn: Whew it is definitely spenny though
[3:50:15] TDesius: LUL
[3:50:37] Daffen_Prime: its very spenny but its still only on preorder after 8months
[3:50:43] Forgedofsouls: got 1 too many meeps, you ended with 70
[3:50:48] Witch_Shaelyn: Damn

[3:56:37] ItsMwindo: LUL Nia
[3:57:19] Witch_Shaelyn: Ngl I doubt I could even play well enough to be able to randomly queue against you Desius KEKW
[3:57:43] TDesius: My issue is I fuck around too much LUL
[3:57:52] Witch_Shaelyn: Same kaifW
[3:58:15] TDesius: Kaif

[3:58:39] TDesius: LUL
[3:59:05] Witch_Shaelyn: Desius. The hell did you suggest this time KEKW
[3:59:11] TDesius: Wait wait wait
[3:59:30] TDesius: You get AS from the first item, and nocturne has passive increase :P
[4:00:05] ItsMwindo: catJAM
[4:00:19] ItsMwindo: Spy X Family
[4:00:56] TDesius: Besides the dumb builds are more fun LUL
[4:01:21] KuruTurtle: @tdesius Is the first item Hexplate?
[4:01:53] TDesius: Hexplate > Axiom > Cyclonic
[4:01:55] Forgedofsouls: morgana jungle
[4:02:32] Kanjin04: If anything gets shredded by the jungle its gotta be a badly played nid or elise
[4:02:52] KuruTurtle: Zyra just got buffed for jungle, her plants deal more dmg to monsters
[4:03:12] TDesius: 420 gold
[4:03:20] hotswitchexe: I'm back from Rob's stream, what's the score for team SR so far?
[4:03:24] Kanjin04: @KuruTurtle As if they didn't do enough to champs already :p
[4:03:28] Kusahri: 18mins later: 19vs3
[4:03:38] Mattingly1998: That's triumph
[4:04:17] KuruTurtle: @kanjin04 Though they did need the dmg of plants normally so they deal less dmg to champs, but it honestly don’t feel that way :v
[4:04:27] KuruTurtle: need=nerf
[4:04:31] hotswitchexe: I just realised Kaif's playing Tryndamere, going that bad huh? Kappa LUL
[4:05:01] TDesius: They're on a 3W - 2L rate atm I believe
[4:05:12] TDesius: Wait no
[4:05:17] TDesius: 4W - 2L
[4:05:19] Kanjin04: @KuruTurtle It's still so much tho, I seriously get almost one shot every time there's a zyra in game
[4:05:34] fabulousemperor: 4W, 1L and 1 warm up game NODDERS
[4:05:35] hotswitchexe: Bard Jungle? LUL I mean if it works then it ain't stupid
[4:05:42] Kanjin04: Like a second Heimer
[4:05:42] hotswitchexe: @TDesius hell yeah
[4:06:00] Mattingly1998: max q
[4:06:04] Mattingly1998: gives more damage
[4:07:01] Witch_Shaelyn: @fabulousemperor Yeah we dont count warm up games NODDERS
[4:07:42] hotswitchexe: we escaping from Iron bois
[4:08:00] Kusahri: oh my Kaif, why is your right arm so big and your left isn't~?
[4:08:19] fabulousemperor: kaifW
[4:08:19] hotswitchexe: LUL
[4:08:42] Kusahri: well hey..if it's in irl like that..you might wanna get help
[4:09:03] Mattingly1998: the fact you were able to do those grubs so fast looks really good
[4:09:28] Kusahri: also Mr. Kaif, when another choccy teapot?
[4:10:07] hotswitchexe: Tryndamere's early game is based on how luck you are
[4:10:08] Mattingly1998: *gets first blood*
[4:10:11] Mattingly1998: hehe
[4:10:20] hotswitchexe: I'm not even joking
[4:10:43] TDesius: Tower shot followed your spin
[4:10:52] Mattingly1998: oh the turret shot hit after the distance of the e went through big yikes
[4:11:55] Exray303: Hows Trindamere as a champ?Not seen him once when playing
[4:12:19] Kusahri: well with IE he should one tap
[4:12:32] TDesius: @Exray303 Trynd is the true definition of go all in and don't stop going in
[4:12:32] hotswitchexe: @Exray303 if you haven't seen him at all when playing, it might tell something about the state of that champ LUL
[4:12:53] Exray303: I do like a champ that commits to a fight without consequences
[4:13:19] Exray303: Every fight is a good fight
[4:13:36] TDesius: If you play him well enough you can always guarantee that even in a 2v1 you will take someone down with you, and sometimes you'll destroy both instantly and walk out breathing
[4:14:00] TDesius: And if you hyper scale you can 1v5
[4:14:08] Exray303: @TDesius Holy moly
[4:14:24] hotswitchexe: unless you get CC'd for your ults entire duration in a teamfight
[4:15:08] TDesius: His Q heals and increases his damage, his W slows and reduces their damage if their back is shown, if they have a higher CC team you grab mercs and wits end, his E is a spin that does a lot of damage and is lowered per crit and his ult is a fuck you I can't go below 1hp
[4:15:39] Exray303: Tactical recall
[4:16:13] TDesius: I miss the days of AP Tryndamere LUL
[4:16:39] R_Fuji: R_Fuji subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! when in doubt blame the jung- ohhhhhhh
[4:16:43] hotswitchexe: Trynd should have a ult duration bar in his healthbar UI like other ults like it such as Swain and Aatrox
[4:17:06] TDesius: Nah I think that would defeat his only strength and niche as a character
[4:18:47] hotswitchexe: if your strength is defined by a lack of visual clarity and knowledge then I wouldn't exactly call that healthy game design, as it punishes especially new players for the audacity of not knowing how long his ult lasts
[4:19:48] TDesius: Yeah but I don't think making things easier to visually see for the sake of it is exactly good game design either. League has 160+ Champions now. Part of the experience as a new player is learning them all.
[4:20:01] Mattingly1998: Navori --> BORK would be suggested
[4:20:09] AdexBE: hey kaif did you know that you can smite champs? kaifHmm
[4:20:30] Ninosai: @TDesius also part of the reason not many new players stay kaifW
[4:20:57] TDesius: @Ninosai I've been apart of the MOBA seen way too much, it's just a natural thing, not just for LoL but all of them. Apart from say HOTS
[4:21:14] ItsMwindo: The true league new player experience is getting yelled at and berated while you desperately try to learn 160+ champions kaifW
[4:21:14] TDesius: DOTA 2 is far worse
[4:21:15] TDesius: LUL
[4:21:20] hotswitchexe: honestly speaking Trynd needs a rework, his ability to win lane is based purely on luck and his need to splitpush doesn't really work in soloQ where communication doesn't exist, and he's shutdown by a well coordinated team
[4:21:40] TItanAuthorized: is this actually Iron?
[4:21:41] TDesius: Trynd is a character that needs a rework aye
[4:21:49] TDesius: But they did say, that if they ever rework him, his ult is staying
[4:21:52] TItanAuthorized: @TDesius big agree
[4:22:00] Mattingly1998: Trynd is a split pusher same area as firoa for masters up
[4:22:28] aeronero: i just realized the undertale music is from stream and not myself playing it i got confused
[4:22:34] TItanAuthorized: No she didn't fuck up. She is Janna
[4:22:54] hotswitchexe: @TDesius yeah, I agree on that, but I think the power budget from the lack of visual clarity on his ult should be moved to other parts of his kit so he feels better to also play against
[4:23:16] TItanAuthorized: don't take inhib
[4:23:23] TItanAuthorized: noooo
[4:23:40] Mattingly1998: Little early you usually leave inhibs so you don't give the enemy more gold with supers
[4:24:01] hotswitchexe: imagine if they stole that LUL
[4:24:05] TDesius: I mean his ult only makes him invulnerable. When fighting him you generally just gotta save some form of CC for him. The rest of his kit is what makes the ult stronger
[4:24:46] TDesius: It's like Yi, his entire kit is annoying but simple. And if he gets CC'd it's basically just saying "No You" to him
[4:25:38] hotswitchexe: exactly, which is I'm not a fan of the new Runaan's interaction with Yi, as it removes the counterplay against him. Kinda hard to CC a champ that's 99% of the time untargteable
[4:26:36] hotswitchexe: Yi also needs a rework, and there's so much potential with especially him, the last user of a godly martial art, they could go real wacky with his rework and it'd be fully justified in lore
[4:26:38] Mattingly1998: the fact that no one is stopping kaif is so broken
[4:26:46] trevisto: based LUL
[4:26:51] TDesius: Besides i'd ratherdeal with and handle a simple champion than one of those 1000 year champions like K'Sante or Aphelios
[4:27:03] Witch_Shaelyn: I hate K'Sante xD
[4:27:21] hotswitchexe: @TDesius remember when Akali could ignore turrets while in her W? LUL
[4:27:29] Mattingly1998: When you take an inhib you need to focus down another lane executed perfectly on macro all in all
[4:27:46] TDesius: Inhibs and Supers apply pressure early on, cause Magic Dealers are generally the only one who can focus/deal with it. Since they have massive defence against AD
[4:27:49] dragoblue666: Yeah 5 turrets after that is pretty good
[4:27:54] hotswitchexe: @Witch_Shaelyn oh I so want to post the K'Sante copypasta but it'd get tagged as spam KEKW
[4:28:48] Mattingly1998: rengar without a bush is just a cat with a ball of string haha
[4:28:57] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[4:29:06] hotswitchexe: when the champ who's whole kit is "don't die" doesn't die LUL
[4:29:27] Mattingly1998: gg 4 game win streak inc
[4:30:34] Mattingly1998: fun fact leveling up trynd ult does nothing
[4:31:22] hotswitchexe: @Mattingly1998 this is technically true, as the bonus you get from leveling Trynd R is non-existant compared to what you get out of other abilities
[4:31:31] TDesius: @Mattingly1998 Cooldown lowered, Minimum health threshold and fury provided on use.
[4:31:47] kirinyeager: kaifPika
[4:31:50] hotswitchexe: @TDesius yeah, the cdr is the only thing that matters out of those
[4:32:03] kirinyeager: kaifGurn
[4:32:06] Mattingly1998: Yeah fundamentally you get more out of another point in q w or e than ult haha
[4:32:40] TDesius: Minimum health threshold can sometimes make the difference between living and not living, the cooldown is amazing to have always, and fury generated means when you ult you can guarantee you'd be at full damage say if you just got CC locked before using it.
[4:32:49] TDesius: It's still decent to level
[4:33:39] fabulousemperor: kaifRemi peepoHappy
[4:33:40] hotswitchexe: the minimum health threshold goes from 30 to 50 and then 70, not really a big difference late game LUL
[4:34:07] TDesius: But it can be enough to let you survive say a burn tick long enough to react with Q
[4:34:11] fabulousemperor: kaifShocked kaif ranking up
[4:34:18] hotswitchexe: if it was 100/250/400 then it'd be a huge difference
[4:34:27] hotswitchexe: or something like that
[4:34:32] TDesius: If it was 100/250/400 then he would infact be broken beyond believe
[4:34:35] TDesius: belief*

[4:37:36] TDesius: My favourite game in LoL is how much can I get under their skin as Yasuo
[4:37:38] nearquaad: league is too much of a coin flip game to ff
[4:37:47] nearquaad: all it takes is one good fight
[4:37:56] Dawholybirch: @TDesius Same for me with Artmeis in Smite
[4:37:57] Mattingly1998: ff'ing was made for 4v5s
[4:37:57] hotswitchexe: @TDesius How would you rework Trynd? I'd start with changing the fury bonus from crit chance to an AD bonus so it's no longer luck, then I'd make it so using your abilities well gives a lot bigger fury bonus compared to just auto-attacking, though I'd keep the abilities simplish
[4:38:34] TDesius: @hotswitchexe Honestly I'm not sure how I would, but I like the Crit / RNG Interaction. I am a fan of RNG.
[4:38:42] nearquaad: i always try to play out the game even when getting stomped and just try and learn why i'm getting stomped
[4:38:57] lordasriel2: rng doesn't really have a place in a moba imo
[4:39:10] Kusahri: some Teemo jgl~?
[4:39:27] TDesius: Isn't the idea of a Crit chance always RNG though? if it aint 100% there's a chance it won't be there
[4:39:33] TDesius: 6 Haunting Guise Teemo?
[4:39:34] hotswitchexe: @TDesius RNG goes heavily against Riot's competitive design principles, so I would bet money that the RNG goes out the window when Trynd gets his rework
[4:40:00] TDesius: But Hotswitch, to effectively remove RNG from the game, they would have to remove Crit.
[4:40:45] hotswitchexe: yeah, but it's better if he has to build it, it feels really bad to lose lane at level 2 against Trynd by him getting some lucky crits
[4:41:04] Kusahri: Tichus tail is so cute :3
[4:41:10] TDesius: But that's part of his kit, he might get those crits, and he might not. So he gambles and could lose
[4:42:09] hotswitchexe: it's kinda toxic that the interaction favors Trynd so heavily, since he scales late anyways so it doesn't matter if he loses lane
[4:42:24] tyr_vidar: kaifTichus
[4:42:28] Ninosai: LUL
[4:42:36] fabulousemperor: pinkni10Niaclown

[6:21:04] Ramps5: darius funny haha
[6:21:05] Witch_Shaelyn: ew infernal Vel. Loser Vel not being a Bee
[6:21:09] BelKiyra: Darius once he gets 5 stacks just pumps out so much true damage specially when they're that fed
[6:21:37] Witch_Shaelyn: Bee'Koz is the only acceptable Vel skin
[6:21:40] Mattingly1998: gets 150 ad just for right clicking 5 times *smile*
[6:21:53] Ramps5: "Team diff" - Player with least impact
[6:22:38] Kusahri: Now Skarner~?
[6:22:44] Witch_Shaelyn: Darius and Vel had too much True damage between the two xD
[6:23:04] BelKiyra: It was mostly Darius tho Velkoz was going support utility and was pretty much useless.
[6:23:31] TDesius: It's the Iron bitch talking shit LUL
[6:24:15] SturmGeist08: I forgot it was Thursday, I thought it was Wednesday. Heya Kaif and chat

[6:24:34] Kusahri: Skar-Skar-Skarner~
[6:24:43] zepidreus: I didnt see, too busy liberating planets for Democracy
[6:24:51] TDesius: Unless you were in the game with him you can't report him. It was done to prevent mass reporting LUL
[6:25:31] BelKiyra: Big oofs
[6:26:04] TDesius: I think it was 9k Damage. Cause I wanted to say What 9000? LUL
[6:26:11] hotswitchexe: fun fact: Teemo Q blocks Viego R
[6:26:16] TDesius: And y'all were like 30-60K
[6:26:25] hotswitchexe: since it's considered an enhanced auto-attack
[6:26:36] Mattingly1998: Fun fact casseopia damage amp on her e works with teemo's e
[6:26:47] Witch_Shaelyn: It was 8.9k just checked
[6:26:58] TDesius: Shae you coulda just said 9K
[6:26:59] TDesius: LUL

[6:27:27] BelKiyra: Less then 9k we're not gonna sugar coat it for her Desius
[6:27:37] hotswitchexe: wait no, apparently Viego R can be dodged or blocked, but not missed
[6:27:39] hotswitchexe: wat
[6:28:06] lego_PRO: 3k or 9k, there is no difference
[6:28:20] zepidreus: especially not after 45 mins
[6:28:25] hotswitchexe: so Viego R is blocked by Jax E or Shen W, but not Teemo Q
[6:28:31] TDesius: 3K wouldn't kill a fully stacked Cho'gath, but 9k would. So there is a difference LUL
[6:28:42] Witch_Shaelyn: kaifW
[6:28:45] TDesius: And it's rare cho'gath hits 10K
[6:28:53] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[6:28:54] BelKiyra: @TDesius But not much when Cho'gaths fed and has 10k Hp
[6:28:56] Witch_Shaelyn: If he's at 10k thats a long ass game
[6:29:04] SturmGeist08: Heya Desius, heya Shaelyn, heya fab and Nino that probably are lurking peepoHey
[6:29:11] TDesius: @BelKiyra I did say and it's rare that Cho'gath hits 10k
[6:29:14] Witch_Shaelyn: Heya Sturm peepoHey
[6:29:17] zepidreus: If you havent done enough damage to kill 3 cho'gaths after 45 mins, youre bad
[6:29:18] hotswitchexe: uh oh

[6:58:37] TDesius: Nia was on 35 LUL
[6:58:58] BelKiyra: poor Nia
[6:59:05] zepidreus: Vision score probably is what denied you the S
[6:59:14] TDesius: Genuinely Control Wards are the thing I always forget about
[6:59:17] Witch_Shaelyn: I dont use enough control wards as a support cuz im dumb and stingey xD
[6:59:31] TDesius: 4
[6:59:50] BelKiyra: 450 isnt that bad really
[6:59:56] Mattingly1998: CS is also apart of that
[6:59:58] Witch_Shaelyn: My income as support is reduced already as is. Im stingey kaifW
[7:00:03] BelKiyra: Specially since yours laster for a good deal too
[7:00:41] TDesius: Fun fact : When Sazar gets ahead or hold a positive KDA he wards less LUL
[7:00:44] Witch_Shaelyn: Beemo Pog
[7:00:52] zepidreus: I'd fight Twitch over Vayne any day
[7:00:59] Witch_Shaelyn: I love all the Bee skins

[7:03:41] Witch_Shaelyn: ayyyyyy
[7:03:49] TDesius: Nia has Red buff LUL
[7:03:57] BelKiyra: Nia is now prime
[7:03:58] xxsargexx: all part of the plan
[7:04:06] zepidreus: Support with Red buff, so useful kaifW
[7:04:22] BelKiyra: THROW THEM BANANA'S
[7:04:29] zepidreus: BANAN
[7:04:38] zepidreus: ROTATA
[7:04:56] TDesius: Low key not gonna lie
[7:04:59] TDesius: Red Buff on Soraka
[7:05:00] TDesius: not bad
[7:05:02] TDesius: it heals her
[7:05:03] TDesius: LUL
[7:05:06] Mattingly1998: the amount of burn kills on this stream are way too damn high
[7:05:07] Witch_Shaelyn: That amount of Dot's is toxic kaifW
[7:05:15] BelKiyra: She has one of the longer ranges for support so she can bully hard
[7:05:48] Witch_Shaelyn: All with Liandries kaifW
[7:05:49] TDesius: Brand, Teemo, Twitch, Singed Cassiopiea
[7:05:53] BelKiyra: Cassi for support
[7:06:04] Felishio: so what ur saying kaif is, singed top, teemo jg, cass mid, twitch brand bot lane
[7:06:14] Witch_Shaelyn: That sounds so toxic but so fun xD
[7:06:27] BelKiyra: Its mostly magic damage but for twitch but ya
[7:07:08] TDesius: But from my Understanding, Cassiopeia gets her E Bonus from Singed, Teemo and Twitch's poisons aswell LUL
[7:07:14] Witch_Shaelyn: Twitch is one of my favorite ADC's
[7:07:47] BelKiyra: Teemo and Singed sadly Twitch has a diffferent poison since it does true damage rather then  Magic damage
[7:07:55] nearquaad: we take those?
[7:07:56] Witch_Shaelyn: Double for Dragon kaifW
[7:08:01] BelKiyra: So Cassie cant use her E on it
[7:08:20] TDesius: Ahh yeah it's no longer a poison like it used to be
[7:08:42] Witch_Shaelyn: I find it Ironic how the rat that places invisible traps has the most amount of control wards kaifW
[7:08:46] BelKiyra: @TDesius ya when they switched it to true damage it lost Cassi Synergy
[7:08:57] TDesius: But Singed and Teemo is enough
[7:09:06] TDesius: Since I believe shrooms are still "poison"
[7:09:13] Witch_Shaelyn: NODDERS
[7:09:25] TDesius: Actually not gonna lie
[7:09:29] TDesius: that's fucking vile
[7:09:36] Witch_Shaelyn: Man with that 5 come 2 can go invis as well kaifW
[7:09:40] Witch_Shaelyn: comp*
[7:09:44] TDesius: Singed and Teemo just literally Empower Cass to the max
[7:09:50] TDesius: Cass never has to land a single poison
[7:10:20] Witch_Shaelyn: Just gotta throw her slow to make sure they dont get away Desius kaifW
[7:10:28] TDesius: That's why singed exists
[7:10:29] TDesius: LUL
[7:10:49] BelKiyra: if Cassi or Singed gets Rylia's they can never run from her

[7:14:33] Ninosai: you been resting?
[7:14:37] TDesius: I wonder if the shaco bug still exists where if you ping him just before he ults it keeps his real self revealed
[7:14:38] TDesius: LUL
[7:14:54] Witch_Shaelyn: Sturm better be resting Smadge

[7:16:30] BelKiyra: @TDesius You can still ignite him and have that be the way to know but ya for the most part either from seeing one take more then the other most ways of knowing are harder to see
[7:16:39] zepidreus: I always believed, Ben is the boi
[7:16:44] fabulousemperor: hiya geist peepoHey
