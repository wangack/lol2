[2:20:49] Shunpaw: Picture this: Gordon Ramsay steps into Solarbacca's gaming setup, watches him effortlessly dominate with Gangplank in League of Legends, and goes, "Bloody hell, mate, your gameplay is more seasoned than my best dishes. Ever thought about earning a Michelin star in the League?" Solarbacca smirks and says, "Gordon, my Gangplank is so legendary, Riot Games is considering a new tier just for me."
[2:20:52] Shunpaw: Suddenly, MrBeast challenges Solarbacca to a League of Legends duel. It's Gangplank vs... well, no one else matters because Solarbacca's barrels are on another level.  Gordon Ramsay, thoroughly entertained, throws in a casual, "This is better than my last kitchen nightmare."  And that's the legend of Solarbacca, the Gangplank master whose gameplay is so epic, even the Michelin star wishes it could be as legendary. 🏴‍☠️🎮🌟
