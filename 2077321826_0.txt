[0:44:43] Fengojo: typical league experience
[0:46:23] SeonjuSinhe: Have you ever tried tankblanc? These new tank items sound fun, specially this Eternal Agony thingie
[0:46:30] Ahrinay: looks like this ahri gots boosted from a karma booster
[0:46:33] Ahrinay: or not ?
[0:47:19] beeG3: sounds about right

[0:49:18] Nightbot: bob please stop moaning on stream, my gf is already suspecting I'm fucking other guys... she can't figure out she's actually right, please dude - ScieCode 8-16-2023
[0:49:37] beeG3: yeah its why i uninstalled last night... ill be back Pepega
[0:50:02] beeG3: HAHA
[0:50:03] SeonjuSinhe: Man i reached semi-pro in starcraft 2, a game way harder mechanically (But 1v1), but i can't get out of plat on league because of the teammates, its so sad that you can be great and keep getting gatekeeped, that or either having no fun because having a team feels more like a chore
[0:51:44] n1nguava: ur item
[0:51:51] SeonjuSinhe: Item
[0:51:52] SeonjuSinhe: supp item
[0:51:54] SeonjuSinhe: please
[0:52:17] truckstopsw: wishing the league ranked was based on both personal performance in game and win/loss rather just win/lost
[0:52:55] SeonjuSinhe: He'll realize in the worst possible moment
[0:53:08] truckstopsw: like you gain lp based on how you perform in game if you win
[0:54:00] SeonjuSinhe: @truckstopsw That or having better mitigations for good performance in case of losing
[0:54:08] truckstopsw: exactly that
[0:54:25] ftUncleDrew: there’s no way to gauge that that would apply fairly to each role
[0:54:34] truckstopsw: tbh, that would incentivize people to try harder and int less
[0:54:36] SeonjuSinhe: Like if i went S+ on every single aspect of the game i won't lose 30 LP
[0:54:55] ChampionshipLeBlanc: destroy her harder than lucian
[0:55:30] SeonjuSinhe: @ftUncleDrew There is absolutely a way to make that, its not really that hard
[0:55:34] SeonjuSinhe: Other games already do it
[0:55:50] ftUncleDrew: @seonjusinhe except there isn’t
[0:55:58] Rykati: @SeonjuSinhe asgreeed. ive had games where we had an afk and it says (loss mitigated) -18 lp. Like wtf LOL thats alot riot
[0:56:14] SeonjuSinhe: @ftUncleDrew Albion online does it lmao
[0:56:16] Buzz_Lait_Clair: BIG
[0:56:24] Buzz_Lait_Clair: supp GAP
[0:56:24] SeonjuSinhe: And they aint a multi billion company
[0:56:29] Astrozlol: why r u lvl 2
[0:56:39] SeonjuSinhe: no supp item and no laning, just roaming
[0:56:55] ftUncleDrew: Albion is completely different lil bro
[0:57:03] ftUncleDrew: it doesn’t work for league
[0:57:08] Buzz_Lait_Clair: lvl 2 xD
[0:57:09] ftUncleDrew: deva have already talked about this
[0:57:14] SeonjuSinhe: @ftUncleDrew Albion has a moba PVP mode
[0:57:17] Buzz_Lait_Clair: 3 Pog
[0:57:29] SeonjuSinhe: And they have mits for performance both for healers and DPS
[0:57:33] SeonjuSinhe: Your point?
[0:57:55] ftUncleDrew: my point is league is a complete different game, you are comparing apples to oranges
[0:58:12] SeonjuSinhe: No, not at all, Arena MOBA pvp with roles
[0:58:16] SeonjuSinhe: Both of them
[0:58:21] Buzz_Lait_Clair: botlane LUL
[0:58:23] SeonjuSinhe: For Crystal arena or summoners rift
[0:58:38] Buzz_Lait_Clair: Gap
[0:58:40] ftUncleDrew: please, go ahead and send an email to riot with all your amazing ideas, I’m sure it’s very easy to implement them
[0:58:48] ftUncleDrew: Kappa
[0:58:54] Trevvdawg_: tuning into the famous lb supp Pog
[0:59:21] truckstopsw: people can't have a healthy dicussion without someone being a complete douche
[0:59:21] SeonjuSinhe: @ftUncleDrew Its so easy to have actual balance on the game too and look at them, keeping the loses non mitigated keeps people engaged and make them play more, its business, they absolutely can do it
[0:59:27] NotASkiller: PepoG Try.. supp on in silver PepoG
