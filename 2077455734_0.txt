[0:25:07] Oglino: Sadge
[0:25:16] ChibiYordle: I hate ISP-Kun now. Smadge
[0:25:22] AQUAMOO: it has Realistic bullet trajectory, but the AIMing is another thing.
[0:25:26] ToutedDjinn: Smadge WhyWontYouJoms ISP!
[0:25:35] IceDispensingSystem: Why does dropping frames cause delay though I don‚Äôt understand
[0:25:39] AQUAMOO: smoke nades make EVERYTHING just miss 90% of the time
[0:25:41] AQUAMOO: even ATGMs
[0:26:00] AQUAMOO: people just start shooting sky wards when smoke is dropped
[0:26:08] AQUAMOO: and atgms are just drunk skunks
[0:26:26] ChibiYordle: @AQUAMOO *shoots at the particles inside the smoke* One of these surely be enemy PepegaGun
[0:28:37] Drainora: Chat, im an AI enjoyer FeelsBadMan
[0:29:14] evilronald44: you can attack it from the back by running over the fence behind that building with a vehicle by the vehicle depot

[0:37:23] evilronald44: this game is the definition of ‚Äúit gets worse‚Äù in terms of what‚Äôs thrown at you
[0:38:27] thatoneguy7119: could of clipped a wall and blown itself up with a mortar shell?
[0:38:28] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.

[0:40:34] Pr4ise_: Its been good for me, just nice chill vibes with that boss
[0:40:47] AQUAMOO: sall good boss!
[0:40:54] ToutedDjinn: Shruge So far it seems better then yesterday? Small delay but not stopping as much
[0:40:54] thatluckyloser: Sorry to draw attention. I was worried it was on my end
[0:41:02] shifty_ai: gather ur forces together and ammo up b4 taking dorm

[0:45:52] ToutedDjinn: hiii
[0:46:06] shifty_ai: hiii
[0:46:20] SuzuyaKai: This game seems extremly challenging
[0:46:39] thatluckyloser: Building op
[0:46:48] thatluckyloser: Nerf with arty
[0:46:52] Dan_Nukem: noaml RTS OP buildings
[0:46:56] thatoneguy7119: buildings seem a bit too strong defensively
[0:47:05] AQUAMOO: strong buildings are OP  almost nothing can break them
[0:47:39] AQUAMOO: and i think the plasma just does reduced dmg to structures as their downside
[0:47:44] shifty_ai: if u can breach everybody inside a building will stop shooting outside
[0:47:48] thatoneguy7119: i mean they are mercenaries lol
[0:49:05] AQUAMOO: that pisses me off the most in this game
[0:49:05] Moobot: Merch is live! Check out all the cool stuff at https://lawlman.com/
[0:49:10] evilronald44: they shot the guy on top of the gun
[0:49:12] thatoneguy7119: do mercenaries have AP rounds?
[0:49:25] AQUAMOO: tho a barret 50 is supposed to pop light armor
[0:49:30] AQUAMOO: still makes me mad
[0:49:37] shifty_ai: turn off the rockets on the heli so it wont do fly bys the miniguns shred infantry in the open
[0:49:48] Darchon_: war is such a headache
[0:52:59] shifty_ai: omg u took the hill i avoided it like the plague at this stage
[0:54:02] AQUAMOO: there should be a bradly
[0:54:42] shifty_ai: he lines up for fly by with rockets
[0:55:06] thatluckyloser: Infantry are so hard to use
[0:55:23] thatoneguy7119: clear out of big bobs way!!
[0:55:23] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[0:55:59] thatoneguy7119: can you imagine a playthrough where big bob dies? the bad timeline
[0:56:12] shifty_ai: putting infantry in defensive and run only instead of shoot and move helps
[0:57:09] Albromyle: Bob donkWalk
[0:57:19] shifty_ai: defensive also gives stealth bonus so u can see and move b4 they see u
[0:58:17] Legate_Aurelius: the helicopters are made of paper but they really shred infantry
[0:58:42] Legate_Aurelius: I think since they fire from above shots register as hitting more frequently than land units
[0:58:52] barbadosblackbelly: Looking
[0:59:59] thatoneguy7119: big bob is your ONLY reliable unit
[1:00:06] thatoneguy7119: Hes never failed us
[1:00:50] JamesXLR8: Susge I don't trust this game when it is going great
[1:00:53] shifty_ai: shot density is huge in this game
[1:00:53] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq
[1:01:05] shifty_ai: causes stagger or suppression
[1:02:02] Oglino: big bob GIGACHAD
[1:02:18] Legate_Aurelius: calderon can drive the bradley
[1:02:30] evilronald44: she can drive the Bradley
[1:03:07] Legate_Aurelius: fuel is important for the helicopter, it burns through it fast
[1:03:55] thatoneguy7119: this lets you replace your humvee fleet
[1:04:05] shifty_ai: they left
[1:04:06] AQUAMOO: they fled
[1:04:11] Legate_Aurelius: NOPERS they were just slaves
[1:04:50] Legate_Aurelius: ye
[1:04:50] Moobot: Pythe has been authorized to set phasers to kill.
[1:05:31] thatoneguy7119: man I just want to see terminators, hope this is the last cartel mission
[1:05:32] Moobot: Don't forget to drink water, especially you @lawlman! >:(
[1:08:40] shifty_ai: armor is always useful
[1:08:40] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[1:10:59] Devious_gastropod: peppoArrive boss is sick again??
[1:11:58] thatoneguy7119: kinda wish this game gave you more evil options, the LT. is a bit too lawlful good.
[1:12:58] evilronald44: @thatoneguy7119 kind of? I‚Äôd say there are some hidden ‚Äúbad‚Äù options like befriending the integrators
[1:14:09] thatoneguy7119: I ultimately understand why there aren‚Äôt more options, like siding with the cartel would require an entirely new set of missions
[1:15:14] ChibiYordle: What ya wanna join the terminators? Susge
