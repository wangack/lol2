[1:46:33] youngbustin: for the ashes development stream? It's gonna be mad he lost last 7 comms
[1:46:36] Jackiedae: @Bustin okay so i have a dilemma. My company is in dire need for workers, like we are so busy. a guy from college said he's looking for technical writing job, and he might be a great fit. however, he's one of those social justice warrior type ppl and seems like he might start drama in the workplace, but if he's remote prob not a big issue. the biggest problem is he accused Seismic of needing help and being racist over facebook when he said he supports cops. should i ghost him on the job?
[1:46:40] WingOfChicken: I was 6 pounds

[1:48:31] Jackiedae: honestly i dont know the context. both of them were probably being extreme on either end. but Seismic was so upset that he blocked the guy and he never blocks ppl. and he told me "do not help him get a job" but I had already told him about it so now I'm in a pickle

[2:08:07] Ekozera: @Bustin One kilogram of chicken in my area is about the price of one hour of work for an average worker. I think people need to calm a bit with the judgement about not working to work tbh

[2:08:25] Treebeard64: got I would get so much catharsis from firing you @Bustin
[2:08:27] imthatShaunguy: @Ekozera corruption sucks though. T_T
[2:08:44] imthatShaunguy: Who makes minimum wage these days?
[2:08:52] ManofArks: @Bustin But at the same time, you've gotta keep in mind you applied to work at a job that needs people to work on a weekend. You don't have to have saturday and sunday off to enjoy your time off work

[2:09:10] Ekozera: The campaign manager for the conservative party in Canada is a Grocer lobbyist. @imthatShaunguy
[2:09:22] Treebeard64: the Wallaces are my family
[2:09:26] Ekozera: They ain't even ashamed
[2:09:28] brammeke01: Work starts at 8, young people show up at 8 and then they go hang there coats take their morning coffee and when theyre done with that its 8:15 and they expect to be paid from when they showed up and not from when they started working
[2:09:43] WingOfChicken: @Bustin Wants to take the afternoon off without having to apply for time off 'because I've worked  hard this week' 󠀀
[2:09:49] Gu11ar: @Ekozera average entry level pay is $19/hr vs $8.58/kg of chicken in quebec
[2:09:51] imthatShaunguy: @Ekozera hate to break it to you, but it's not always conservatives to blame. turns out every party is shit. :)
[2:09:56] Snuffles1120: we haven't had a federal minimum wage hike in the last 15 years
[2:10:03] Exrale: @Bustin hey, your breath smells amazing today
[2:10:11] ManofArks: No, I really don't. I'd tell my kid that they applied to work there, so if they don't want those hours, find a different place to work. If it's an occasional weekend off, they can request off and it gets approved
[2:10:12] Treebeard64: its really different for salaried employees imo
[2:10:18] Ekozera: @Gu11ar No. Chicken is now 20$/kg in my area
[2:10:21] Auraina: because my mommy told me I'm special.
[2:10:43] Zarb7: @WingOfChicken can I have tomorrow (Friday) off please? I've worked my normal hours this week and I'm really burning out
[2:10:45] Ekozera: @Gu11ar I literally saw that in 3 supermarkets. Different one
[2:10:56] WingOfChicken: @Bustin This person also wants a payrise because they can't afford their mortgage right now and might have to sell their house. Yes, that situation sucks, but it's not the companies responsibility to manage your personal finances?

[2:11:48] Treebeard64: pour one out
[2:11:52] Ekozera: @imthatShaunguy We have a huge cartel problem and all grocers are own by 3 major corporations. Also the intermediate steps in food productions are owned by only a few owners too
[2:11:54] Snuffles1120: the average wage in America is $60k a year

[2:12:23] imthatShaunguy: @Ekozera how are the chicken supplies? Could there have been an endemic that wiped the population?

[2:13:53] Snuffles1120: New Zealand is not an at will employment country, it's like apple to oranges
[2:13:55] Zarb7: thats wild, the average wage in the UK is apparently roughly $38k
[2:13:55] meatboy6907: @Bustin how much u wanna bet she handed the kid an iPad to occupy him as soon as he wake up and proceeded to completely ignore him
[2:13:59] WingOfChicken: @Bustin These are all 100% legit examples
[2:14:13] Jackiedae: you say "its in our company handbook that the work day starts at 9am, unless your supervisor approves a different schedule for you" (which they might)
[2:14:16] Ekozera: @imthatShaunguy True, But it is also an excuse nowaday to reason the hike in price. We have a current internal struggle where the government is trying to force legislation to break price gouging and corporations are digging heels.

[2:15:18] Gu11ar: average wage for the country is so random it's the worst stat to use. Average wage in the US is 70k but there are 5 states whos salary is higher. and all regions are lower. its so bad
[2:15:22] ManofArks: And THERE'S the real issue
[2:15:28] Treebeard64: imo the best cure is a heavy dose of anxiety medication and a job at one of the mega asshole corporations

[2:15:56] Zarb7: @Bustin I was cancelling my car insurance the other day to swap to a different company who gave me a better price for the coming year, and the cheeky cunt on the phone had the audacity to ask me what the other company had offered me so that they could potentially adjust their offer, i politely told them "im not willing to discuss that", but in my head i called them a cunt
[2:15:58] Snuffles1120: @farmer_yankee it's not a joke, that's the sad part
[2:15:59] meatboy6907: @Bustin it's almost like somehow the taxes on rich people got drastically lowered at some point
[2:15:59] WingOfChicken: @Bustin It was a few weeks back but I said something along the lines of 'We're very flexible in this office but you need to be courteous to your colleagues. If you have a situation at home that means you'll be late, let us know as soon as you can so we can plan for your absence, and then we can discuss how you can make that time back'.

[2:16:47] meatboy6907: @youngbustin stop being weirdly on topic
[2:16:48] farmer_yankee: the whole reason you see all these super rich people pushing right vs left is because if we weren't fighting then it would be rich vs poor
[2:16:48] youngbustin: @meatboy6907 Oh, look at you, trying to stifle my creativity! It must be hard when someone can outshine you with their unique flair. Remember, embracing your individuality is key to standing out in a crowd.

[2:17:32] Treebeard64: one time when I was more revolutionary (on drugs) I did a deep dive on what social system would best describe how the Hobbits of the Shire function and came up with anarcho-syndicalism
[2:17:40] imthatShaunguy: @Bustin I would have been right with you.
[2:17:49] Ekozera: That is why Wing is manager. That is how you get promotion in Corporate world

[2:18:29] Gu11ar: @Zarb7 that's a normal thing for both sides to do. you want a better rate and they want to keep getting money from you. same thing happens when you leave a job. the current employer, most of the time, will counter offer.
[2:18:36] brammeke01: And thats why im happy im in eu, although we've got crazies aswell, but we dont have yalls kinda crazy

[2:20:09] Maeybara: or just have 800 eth and dont work at all
[2:20:27] WingOfChicken: @Bustin The conversation I had last week with someone was about them showing up an hour late, then having a shower at work and sitting at their desk 90 MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO START. Every day.
[2:20:29] Maeybara: why not specifically from me?
[2:20:33] Treebeard64: @Gu11ar I was more commenting on the firing angle not understanding how the NZ/at will piece fit wing's example, not so much how to coach a person to do better
[2:20:35] Gu11ar: I just gotta work 8 hrs as long as im there between 10am and 3pm

[2:22:14] Gu11ar: @Treebeard64 yeah that's what i'm talking about. if a company fires someone and that person can't find a job they can apply for gov aid. the gov doesn't just let companies do that. hence why it's not as easy as "you aren't doing your job well so you're gone"
[2:22:39] KrimsonCobra: @WingOfChicken if i send you a instramental cotten eye joe will you go sing in the discord?
