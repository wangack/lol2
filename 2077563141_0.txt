[0:49:52] B_as_in_Bacon: pffft... dm trying to throw people off the scent
[0:49:53] DancingCorpse: So you were drinking for two?
[0:49:53] bluedude153: I really need to do a convergence mod playthrough

[0:50:12] Expremental: @girl_dm_ have you ever played randomizer Elden Ring?
[0:50:12] DancingCorpse: You never explained WHY you had to explain the copy pasta
[0:50:14] rex_draconum_: I saw the theory that Messmer is a sort of demonic figure that Mogh was trying to summon to possess Miquella
[0:50:20] scumbagpossum: Bless the lucky individual whgo is married to dm, bless their soul
[0:50:25] kinglordemperorpresident: YOU GOT DRUNK FOR HER! THAT'S SO SWEET!

[0:50:42] CaverMH: i hate it when the animals have no bones
[0:50:45] bluedude153: The convergence mod for Dark Souls 3 let me summon a giant crab ally at will so I have high hopes for the Elden Ring version
[0:50:46] lukenoeliii: Ah, good good
[0:50:48] rex_draconum_: Miquella being a Christ figure, therefore making Messme the antichrist.
[0:50:51] Sir_Khris: ALL ANIMALS MUST DIE
[0:50:55] Skritty: ye, the later half of the video is all about messmer
[0:51:04] bluedude153: go punch dragon
[0:51:06] B_as_in_Bacon: good way to find out if he does: watch the youtube video
[0:51:07] jackjumbo: i dont understand how i mistook ff14 for ff7 remake
[0:51:10] TheRealDEFOX: I got a new Xbox controller yesterday because I messed up the left trigger of my old one spamming Corpse Piler
[0:51:15] Sir_Khris: kill them, then skin them, then cook them. just like in delicious in dungeon girldmSnack
[0:51:16] TheRATifier1: All I remember from that announcement is a vtuber replying to a spam bot saying "Elizabeth now is not the time for schmex, elden ring shadow of the erdtree finally has a release date!" in all caps. and it was the funniest thing ever.
[0:51:26] blu_jay22: Ohhhhh
[0:51:27] LordBlackstar: @rex_draconum_ That theory is stupid and objectively wrong. Messmer is a son of Marika. that's not even speculative, we have an official statement on it.
[0:51:29] jackjumbo: maybe its cause i was trouble shooting hell diver2 errors

[0:52:59] Tinchade: bird too quick
[0:53:00] DancingCorpse: but you said you could explain
[0:53:03] your_kouhai0: Bleed scarlet rot and poison*
[0:53:08] Skritty: YOU DIDNT PRAISE
[0:53:14] Layzay73: so when are we getting the live react thing here ?
[0:53:21] RvLeshrac: She said *tomorrow*
[0:53:21] tarkxt: that poor dog

[0:53:37] LordBlackstar: @LeotoBrilloVT She's gonna be using perfumes as a central part of the build. that's all though.
[0:53:40] DancingCorpse: oh, so just leaving it at that, huh?
[0:53:44] TheRealDEFOX: I stopped using Rivers of Blood though so I won't have that issue again
[0:53:46] Layzay73: that shindigs worked on
[0:53:50] LeotoBrilloVT: @LordBlackstar Oooooh. Perfumes.
[0:53:51] Tinchade: More 5 minute crafts? girldmHuh

[0:54:02] Layzay73: https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1762695200772915666
[0:54:09] LeotoBrilloVT: But hey this is ER, anything works
[0:54:14] electrode13_5: Only thing we react to in this kingdom is 5 minute crafts, and the reaction is disgust
[0:54:15] kinglordemperorpresident: THE BACON FOGHT BACK
[0:54:30] bluedude153: The buffs are powerful people just....dont use items in these games
[0:54:31] LeotoBrilloVT: I mean: This being elden Ring, I assume you can make anyhthing work under the right condition.
[0:54:32] FeliciaIsMaiWaifu: @electrode13_5 That is the truth.
[0:54:33] rex_draconum_: Oh you know Shindigs? That
[0:54:40] Sir_Khris: the only thing I know about perfumes is that they stink when too much is used at once.
[0:54:42] your_kouhai0: I seen people beat this game with nothing but fists, and... thats a fun sight
[0:54:48] BravelilTailor: It's E;den Ring, you can make anything work with enough preparation
[0:54:50] rex_draconum_: That's awesome, I keep seeing the really cool integration stuff he does come up on my Twitte.r
[0:54:53] LeotoBrilloVT: @bluedude153 Buffs in this game also come with a LOT Of caveats between un-buffable somber weapons, limitations on a per-type buff, etc.
[0:54:56] LordBlackstar: @LeotoBrilloVT They're lowkey pretty nuts. They definitely aren't the biggest standout because of the farming involved, though.
[0:54:56] Layzay73: @BravelilTailor E;den

[0:56:07] RubenSargasm: yo yo yo how ya guys doin guuSit
[0:56:11] LeotoBrilloVT: Most ER Builds either devolve into just: Untactical megaton bombs, or stacking up as much power into your weapon as possible.
[0:56:16] your_kouhai0: The antspur rapier! I love that weapon

[1:05:32] LVL1gecko: I mean I spammed through the quests and then watched a 4 hour vid about ARR
[1:05:34] SussySeraph: I had a friend who harassed me to play ff14, he was the same one who wanted me to watch one piece... I feel like there's a connection there
[1:05:36] electrode13_5: Thank ou for stream DM, hope you get good drops for your stinky bottle build
[1:05:49] mecha_ouroboros: ultra motives
[1:05:50] Brennanahaha: I kinda feel that, when I was first introduced to the game I was abandoned in the golden saucer at level 11 and given no real idea on what to do from there
[1:05:50] Jrunnah: KaniFE ICANT
[1:05:51] DancingCorpse: ALL of your motives?  Oh my...
[1:05:54] your_kouhai0: I just got told "Oh you arent playing Elden Ring, your playing Skyrim because you dont parry" Like... Im sorry? Im playing my way you play yours? carina34Huh
[1:05:56] Skritty: kudos to @jaxmaru for helping me through the dungeons

[1:05:59] Mana_Sora: Don't like that you have to login within 45 days or you lose your in game house. I understand it but dislike it and hope they remove it
[1:05:59] LeotoBrilloVT: When you play through the entirety of Persona 5 out of Spite, after knowingly not liking the first place.....Yera.
[1:06:05] pascals_rager: Couldn't get into 14. I think I'm just tired of MMOs.
[1:06:24] lamashdeux: I never really got past the bad impression it left on everyone back in 2010.

[1:06:42] pepthread: girldmHiF fillyFlexR
[1:06:44] TheMilkman187: MTQ im sorry
[1:06:46] bluedude153: Honestly the car isnt that useful anymore, there are a lot more mounts that hold multiple people
[1:06:48] SirZetch: GirlDM go vroom vroom in 14
[1:06:51] Sir_Khris: maybe Ashes of Creation could be that MMO
[1:06:54] Kawahira: I just roll into him instead of attack lol
[1:06:57] B_as_in_Bacon: I am not sure that "the car" fixes fundamental issues with my high fantasy mmorpg

[1:07:00] mecha_ouroboros: boc
[1:07:02] LordBlackstar: @Sir_Khris But classic WoW is also a trash fire
[1:07:04] LeotoBrilloVT: @bluedude153 Yea, but it's also swaggy.

[1:07:36] rex_draconum_: Isn't 14 the one where they literally rebuilt it from the ground up with a new developer because it was so bad?
[1:07:45] LeotoBrilloVT: @rex_draconum_ Yes
[1:07:52] cruisec0ntrol: @LordBlackstar WOW's communbity is a miss due to the so called, " social contract along with other implementations

[1:08:35] mecha_ouroboros: boc is nice but warrior pot alexander is better
[1:08:44] TheTempestCleric: I just finished ARR and loved the ending but it was quite slow
[1:08:47] TheRealDEFOX: Speaking of MMOs I quit Elsword because it was too much grind and too much money. It's the type of game EA wishes they could have
[1:08:49] LeotoBrilloVT: @rex_draconum_ it's also currently the only thing keeping Square Enix from being considered being the biggest trashfire in gaming.

[1:33:16] IykI: wait, you don't have a gold fowl foot?
[1:33:17] LeotoBrilloVT: I'm not trying to backseat you DM, I'm just giving some general advice for the game, saying as a general statement, Super-charging your attack stat in the early game is kind of a bad idea because most endgame damage comes from Maxed out weapon scaling.

[1:34:54] SyrobeNA: aether131MYAAAAAA aether131Wave
[1:34:55] Oroboro: super underrated
[1:34:58] OzuPazu: I dont want to back seat but you should play the game sidways so that gravity helps makes the health bars go down faster

[1:36:15] LeotoBrilloVT: Good choice.
[1:36:16] Nemurenai_Kai: I am backseating you in FFXIV. As a when you evolve from poogylist to Munk, generally you want the Lunar Solar opener to ensure the most uses of Phantom Rush per encounter. Except when you use the Double Solar opener to line up Phantom Rush with the team's 2 minute buff window.
