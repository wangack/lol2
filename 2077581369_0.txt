[0:38:20] Dethrey: This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure because the Earth does not orbit the Sun in precisely 365 days. Since about the 15th century, this extra day has been 29 February, but when the Julian calendar was introduced, the leap day was handled differently in two respects.

[0:38:42] edm3sh: @Pobelter to balance out the earth around the sun rotation. if not you would have summer weather during winter
[0:38:42] MalahPls: The worse design is that Feb has 28 days normally when they could just take two of the 31 months and even it out.
