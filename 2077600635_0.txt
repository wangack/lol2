[0:32:20] itsanthony1115: she got 7 kills in a row and was close to useless
[0:32:40] itsanthony1115: like shes strong but its just hard to close out games with her
[0:32:49] Pawskal: Thats the point in soloq
[0:33:03] Piemaster_7: you have to really stay ahead as kalista
[0:33:18] Piemaster_7: also she functions a lot better when your team does stuff with your early power
[0:33:25] notanjiin: this is true
[0:33:35] Hunting907: i just lost the most frustrating game ever. I do not know how to climb out of bronze as a Jhin main
[0:34:04] notanjiin: they didnt peel for her that well either just because she's allowed to jump its so confusing how soloq players play with a kalista
[0:34:13] Piemaster_7: gm is like 400
[0:34:37] notanjiin: @hunting907 work on your decision making during the game i'd say
[0:34:50] s_logan_s: What rank are u rn
[0:34:52] Amaco__: i started league at the final half of last season and its really hard to climb out of bronze for me
[0:35:03] notanjiin: like always question why you're making a decision and realize the rationale of your decisions to make better decisions
[0:35:07] Piemaster_7: i think im gonna be 1 or 2 lp under the cutoff today
[0:35:12] Piemaster_7: but too tired to play more
[0:35:24] Hunting907: Hunting907 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! hope your games are going better than mine just did. I think it is impossible to climb out of bronze. these people do not want to win

[0:42:11] notanjiin: ill hop on my pc and help u out
[0:42:38] kenzokami: itâ€™s also the fact that most companies sign 20-30 year leases and so have already paid or are paying for that real estate so they see it as a waste of money if the offices arenâ€™t being used
[0:42:55] nyxionite: the last few years have shown that WFH does work pretty well
