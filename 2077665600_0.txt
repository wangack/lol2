[3:39:48] Gnatboy1177: -1
[3:39:51] FartDiddler: with conq/ludens
[3:39:51] RyanCRobert: -1
[3:39:53] Rose06012: @FartDiddler bluesns is going to see it this weekend too tell him
[3:39:56] ChadingoYitten: -1
[3:40:14] blarggy: are we being degen today? catAsk
[3:40:24] BrothulhuPhtagn: @obamaspawner  you can never fit it all in film. I think they were true to it and led well into messiah.
[3:40:24] psyizaroppi: so bright
[3:40:25] ChadingoYitten: catAsk
[3:40:35] FartDiddler: heim is super strong rn
[3:40:36] FartDiddler: in solo lanes
[3:40:50] xatjc: scary good support 😱😱😱

[3:41:33] ChadingoYitten: SWAG
[3:41:36] ChadingoYitten: !zwag
[3:41:36] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[3:41:36] FartDiddler: POG
[3:41:36] 1TheRedFox: A little hairy though
[3:41:37] FartDiddler: ZWAG!!!

[3:42:03] ienjoyoatmilk: pekin i long for the sweet embrace of a full ap jax mid game. I think if you did that for me I would fall in love with you. Our hearts would entertwine and our souls would link as we spiraled through our life together
[3:42:05] 1TheRedFox: @ChadingoYitten nothing wrong with hairy legs
[3:42:13] BrothulhuPhtagn: @obamaspawner  I think they are saving what’s missing for film 3. keep that in mind. strategically withheld.

[4:45:35] 6midgets: For the boiz
[4:45:35] FartDiddler: !zwag
[4:45:36] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[4:45:38] ienjoyoatmilk: i will kiss pekin on the lips if he can get even one kill on rakan mid
[4:45:38] hyp3rballad: Bitch imma top cuz ain't nobody fuckin me
