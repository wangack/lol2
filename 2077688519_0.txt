[3:32:24] hotmot: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[3:32:29] DarkEvilDIE: They nerfed mundo to hell and now he is a useless champion that does nothing
[3:32:34] friendlycrackdealer: Our healthcare is actually pretty damn good.  There are dozens of countries where their citizens come to America to get certain ops.
[3:32:37] LtAvalanche: healthcare is usually terrible when free = >> wait times
[3:32:56] Kudosa: ITs not free but its worth :D
[3:33:03] Mikeykeaz: right.
[3:33:10] LtAvalanche: i needed an x ray last week and got the x ray 1 hour after making an appointment on my app. Can you do that in EU?
[3:33:13] Durmindoo: In UK and Canada its basically this. Wait forever
[3:33:13] LtAvalanche: no you can't lmao
[3:33:21] mehits: Merica has the best healthcare it’s just expensive af
[3:33:31] majistimus2000: Canada’s health care sucks
[3:33:33] Jumpymelons3: @LtAvalanche yes, xray is kinda urgent thing
[3:33:45] friendlycrackdealer: We don't need free, just affordable.
[3:33:53] Durmindoo: Here in Brazil as well. But the health insurance you get basically uses the public ones to subsidize the cost
[3:34:04] rawrqq: is hubris ashe a thing monkaS
[3:34:10] LtAvalanche: the problem is it's easy to afford when you're employed; when you're struggling it gets complicated

[3:34:14] ghost2523: there are exceptions like Switzerland
[3:34:20] definitely_not_ken: what is really interesting is the history around healthcare being tied to work
[3:34:28] fatalityphase: Only somewhat long wait times if it's non crucial conditions lol
[3:34:28] kurotora666: Free here in Finland and got the Help immediately Last time. But we pay a lot of taxes.
[3:34:28] dblerb: don’t we pay more per capita with worse outcomes?
[3:34:32] Durmindoo: And being free, the quality ovaries greatly by region
[3:34:32] definitely_not_ken: goes back to the new deal
[3:34:35] dreadd39: @definitely_not_ken its to reduce striking
[3:34:49] dreadd39: & quitting
[3:34:53] Mertakhan: It was a joke about "for profit" healthcare. The motive of which incentivizes focus on chronic diseases. Whether the system is better or worse is difficult to say. Both have some benefits
[3:34:55] LtAvalanche: when a country has a lot of "Free" stuff usually it's just tied to high taxation, they get you either way chat
[3:34:57] dblerb: being dependent on a job for health insurance sucks
[3:35:07] saphlan: free healthcare isn't a thing, the question is whether you pay insurance companies or the government through taxes
[3:35:27] Durmindoo: But is true, no such thing as free healthcare. You're paying one way or another
[3:35:28] dblerb: they already do
[3:35:31] TheCozmicOne: wins with the based takes .. healthcare is a you can only pick two of 3 .. cost .... efficency ... quality
[3:35:33] Thruppy: sundered sky healing is ridiculous no ?
[3:35:33] Blackhuf: if they need it, yeah
[3:35:40] br00tswaymb: yes I want people to have healthcare whether they are employed or not
[3:35:46] dblerb: let them die?
[3:35:51] fatalityphase: Paying for insurance is just taxed healthcare with extra headaches
[3:36:02] jesuslove7777777: @br00tswaymb  Come to Germany xd
[3:36:11] likimba: thats some real NA stuff
[3:36:21] LtAvalanche: @dblerb nobody is letting anyone die, if it's urgent they get immediate care. that's a myth brother
[3:36:25] Durmindoo: And some doctors wont want to go to remote areas
[3:36:28] PillarofFlesh: its already 6 months to get a pcp FeelsBadMan
[3:36:35] olafplayer: Children should be covered
[3:36:36] Shut_ItDown_: other countries do it

[3:36:42] Fisurator: In europe works bro
[3:36:53] dreadd39: @Fisurator yeah how are them taxes LUL
[3:36:54] saphlan: insurance is the reason the cost is so high to begin with
[3:37:03] definitely_not_ken: what  stupid statement…you have to pay for any service, doesn’t mean it is a tax
[3:37:03] squallphin: The USA Healthcare system is amazing... not
[3:37:19] dreadd39: @Fisurator and wait times
[3:37:24] Mertakhan: Oh god, what have I done.... I shouldn't have started this.... BibleThump
[3:37:29] saphlan: it's a profiting middleman, of course it's going to make costs go up
[3:37:31] LtAvalanche: the quality of the healthcare is actually the best in the world, you're all arguing about affordability
[3:37:35] Mikeykeaz: what did you do!
[3:37:40] definitely_not_ken: US healthcare system underwrites the global healthcare system
[3:37:40] friendlycrackdealer: A lot of the costs in healthcare are because of administrative.
[3:37:48] Francois_Fapperino: even sex? Sadge
[3:37:55] TheCozmicOne: saame with "free college" its not free lool
[3:38:01] br00tswaymb: once you retire no healthcare, make sure you die young
[3:38:02] Durmindoo: Comparing to the US x Brazil. US has less taxes and here we pay like 12% more in taxes with shit quality
[3:38:15] LtAvalanche: the quality = the cost guys

[3:39:28] definitely_not_ken: the effort is the cost so it isn’t free

[3:40:29] Pesiek: i think game is over :(
[3:40:52] odmaster117: @tieoh actually facts , one of my buds try to off himself and he said he was better off offing himself cause the bill was crazy
[3:40:53] Midgeton: the reason its so shit in the US is due to the corruption. The majority of health care providers are owned by insurance companies, allowing them to collude for higher prices and profit.   the wait time argument is mostly irrelevant because wait times are already absurd.
[3:41:07] olafplayer: Canyon
[3:41:49] Chr0nicConsumer: Here in North Korea no problem!

[3:42:01] sladeadc: i live in canada
[3:42:04] sladeadc: and there are mad wait times
[3:42:16] Chr0nicConsumer: Germany here, never experienced a wait time
[3:42:19] sladeadc: 5 hour wait time at ER minimum
[3:42:23] definitely_not_ken: I think you are arguing with 13 yo kids
[3:42:28] friendlycrackdealer: There's a balance that we need to strike. Yesyes
[3:42:31] friendlycrackdealer: YesYes
[3:42:33] rory_fking1: we have free health care but it's getting overloaded from all of the immigration
[3:42:34] Fyrok: Germany high taxes no?
[3:42:40] fatalityphase: There is high wait times as well with doctors in the US. Took me almost 3 months to see mine, just last year.
[3:42:48] Kudosa: yes we have high taxes here
[3:42:49] Gator1013: Canada is awfull......My friend has a terrible mean doctor and your not allowed to change. You have to go to him.
[3:42:49] fonchiniman: the will to not be fat?
[3:42:50] xHei_57: same with México, the wait times are months sometimes
[3:42:55] rosivagyok: problem: im paying taxes for the lung cancer treatment of chain smokers
[3:42:57] fonchiniman: i eat whatever i want
[3:42:59] definitely_not_ken: not sure elasticity of demand is a concept has been shared with them
[3:43:03] Mertakhan: @Chr0nicConsumer Then you've never had to go to a radiologist. For public insurance 6 months wait time (for non-emergency) is common
[3:43:08] LightPulse21: There is also evidence wait times in the US are about the same
[3:43:11] fonchiniman: besides super expensive food
[3:43:19] mdincer: Belgium has crazy taxes😂😂
[3:43:27] PillarofFlesh: in my area its 6 months out to just get a normal apt
[3:43:35] rory_fking1: states health care is pretty good if your rich
[3:43:35] Durmindoo: There are cases in Brazil that the hospital calls the person for the exam but they died 2 years prior
[3:43:59] friendlycrackdealer: Non-life threatening I think?
[3:44:04] fatalityphase: Dermatology, that isn't skin cancer related.

[3:44:24] Mertakhan: @Wingsofdeath That was an answer to a guy who meant there were no wait times in germany
[3:44:36] Kudosa: They are probably talking about CTs or MRTs
[3:44:43] Francois_Fapperino: i mean yeah that would also happen in a free healthcare country
[3:44:49] Kudosa: We have wait times if you need a specialist
[3:44:49] BabTomorri1: called my doc on Tuesday had an appointment Wednesday morning
[3:45:07] barren_wuffet: South korea has the best health care imo
[3:45:07] definitely_not_ken: not with kaiser
[3:45:14] Chr0nicConsumer: The thing is there are private clinics in countries like Germany, so you can skip the wait if you wanna pay
[3:45:16] definitely_not_ken: that can be same day
[3:45:29] fatalityphase: So I guess wait times just depend on where you live, regardless of country.
[3:45:33] Kudosa: Yep
[3:45:35] Kudosa: True
[3:45:55] definitely_not_ken: what do you do for insurance? you work a day job?
[3:46:08] friendlycrackdealer: @definitely_not_ken probably out of pocket
[3:46:11] 6x5x1x18: That is called being a woman.
[3:46:14] Chr0nicConsumer: D: why not
[3:46:15] Kudosa: LUL
[3:46:19] friendlycrackdealer: @definitely_not_ken unless he has a family plan
[3:46:19] fatalityphase: @definitely_not_ken You can buy insurance yourself
[3:46:21] Mikeykeaz: robots and pancakes.
[3:46:28] MissMountainGoat: EMS worker here 🖐️  a fracture isn't necessarily non-emergent. There are patients waiting for cancer and other life-threatening conditions diagnostics for 3+ months, it is very common
[3:46:42] sladeadc: DRAMA
[3:47:09] yourafghandaddy: It's much cheaper to have a national healthcare
[3:47:22] Chr0nicConsumer: Depends on the cancer
[3:47:28] kleyton_cl: no, not really
[3:47:33] MissMountainGoat: Exactly, yet many clinics/hospitals/insurances will not schedule them for months.
[3:47:36] ScarletRainMk1: if its the point thats its an emergency you're already pretty far gone
[3:47:41] HaxHai: emergency really just refers to how immediately someone needs medical attention or risk dying
[3:47:41] definitely_not_ken: not according to the carrier, dealing with that now with my FIL
[3:47:42] Mikeykeaz: taxes.
[3:47:42] Starsha21: and nobody wants tax increase
[3:47:43] zain_________: depends on the stage as well
[3:47:44] yourafghandaddy: It's cheaper
[3:47:46] legendz411: water check!
[3:47:49] rory_fking1: ppl dont realize Canada has like 45% taxes KEKW
[3:47:52] yourafghandaddy: Google it much cheaper
[3:47:59] definitely_not_ken: 3 months in California, but it is a niche cancer specialist
[3:48:02] HaxHai: even with that standard it's sometimes subject to how the dispatcher interpret the situation
[3:48:04] Mikeykeaz: I haven’t seen a water check in a long ass time. lmao.
[3:48:06] sladeadc: @rory_fking1 my brother in christ. Carbon tax is nuts
[3:48:07] fatalityphase: Insurance is kinda the same way. You're paying for everyone else essentially under the same company.
[3:48:13] legendz411: Respect for taking a sip bro
[3:48:17] yourafghandaddy: It's still s lot cheaper
[3:48:26] MissMountainGoat: I am originally from a country with free healthcare now living in the us, free healthcare is usually oversaturated by lower income population, but employers offer private insurance just like in the US so you always have that option. However, the care at public hospitals is usually much better.
[3:48:32] Kudosa: It might be Hmm
[3:48:33] LightPulse21: You pay for everyone using your same insurance is just a club vs everyone thing
[3:48:34] definitely_not_ken: yeah
[3:48:36] Hide_on_Fishbones: zed top Kappa
[3:48:46] Yukizako0_0: alot of this situational depending on where you live what doctors are available in the area etc. It was the same when I was deployed to a small island yeah we still had the same qualility doctors but if there was a need for a specefic surgery of course that takes longer.
[3:48:50] rory_fking1: @sladeadc  yeah i disliek what the little potato has done with canada carbon tax is nuts
[3:48:57] fonchiniman: privatized health care is good if middle men greedy pharma people and other leaches get in the way
[3:48:59] Kudosa: Why though. Is she Op currently or smth? News to me

[3:49:20] Mikeykeaz: lessss go wangs.
[3:49:21] legendz411: the only real solid position i have on the healthcare thing is that it should NOT be tied to employment
[3:49:37] moodymaddy: Im off to play last epoch, gonna leave the phone open on ur stream though SeemsGood
[3:49:40] Midgeton: thats why its referred to as 'universal health care' not 'free' health care.  it IS cheaper because its government provided, meaning there are regulations on how much health care providers are able to charge over their costs.   Fun Fact, of the day, government agencies, by law, are protected from price gouging.
[3:49:43] legendz411: employee/employer is already inherently imbalanced power relationship
[3:49:55] legendz411: tieing health care to employment is just making it worse
[3:50:03] Kudosa: Disagree. That can't be true xin isn't fun Kappa
[3:50:15] Kazull_: Higher taxes don't matter. there has been multiple reports that show we in the U.S pay way more on health insurance and doctor visits than if we had universal healthcare taxes. You pay high taxes but you get it back.
[3:50:19] MissMountainGoat: @legendz411 it's not tied to employment, you just get better options for "cheaper"
[3:50:29] hashinshin_dont_ban_me: Wings kinda looks like Jin kazama today
[3:50:34] Advesperate: its 100% cheaper
[3:50:35] fonchiniman: we dont spend pur money wizely
[3:50:35] legendz411: @MissMountainGoat Thats actually a good point
[3:50:38] Advesperate: i worked in healthcare,
[3:50:39] fatalityphase: It's paying for taxes vs paying for health insurance.
[3:50:41] yourafghandaddy: It's a lot cheaper overall
[3:50:46] legendz411: I forget the ACA is a thing now
[3:50:48] saphlan: it's a lot cheaper
[3:50:49] Advesperate: the insurance companies are for profit businesses
[3:50:54] mdincer: Its cheaper for sure
[3:50:55] yourafghandaddy: That's why the US will soon have it as well
[3:50:56] Covasertv: you think american's pay less taxes?
[3:50:59] kleyton_cl: it is a lot cheaper. also it is a worst service, but it is an exchange
[3:51:01] legendz411: @MissMountainGoat fair play
[3:51:16] legendz411: Nah but they are right though
[3:51:16] MissMountainGoat: @Covasertv bruh I live in cali, I pay taxes on my taxes lmao
[3:51:31] legendz411: That is a good counterpoint to my arguement
[3:51:33] Midgeton: your taxes are higher for any number of reasons. giving an example like sweden they have extensive support for maternity leave that costs much more than the healthcare tax.
[3:51:45] JohnneMANN: I pref low ranked doctors Kappa
[3:51:46] lphspiky: Based wings
[3:51:48] Mertakhan: No more mundo, can we stop with the healthcare discussion BibleThump  That is a neverending discussion (Mainly because both systems are fairly ok at what they do)
[3:51:53] Kudosa: FeelsOkayMan good flash
[3:51:59] Covasertv: @MissMountainGoat sound like universal care is cheper then :P
[3:52:01] Rankansen: cmon man try ravenous hydra on jax
[3:52:06] legendz411: I like the discussion as long as we keep it rational and civil
[3:52:08] legendz411: modcheck
[3:52:16] MissMountainGoat: @Covasertv there are pros and cons to both
[3:52:18] Thicc_Fil_A: im a nurse practitioner and i stopped there....shit is definitely not easy
[3:52:19] legendz411: its all gucci if wings is good with it anyways

[3:52:35] legendz411: holy shit
[3:52:45] Hide_on_Fishbones: xin jerking on a bush KEKL
[3:52:46] mdincer: Lol
[3:52:48] saphlan: the US system with very limited residency spots for doctor's specialization also raises prices by artificially limiting number of specialists
[3:52:54] Hide_on_Fishbones: nunu already got 2 ganks
[3:52:54] Mikeykeaz: lol it’s crazy. damn near every game.
[3:52:59] direpants2: xin's jerkin it
[3:53:08] Mikeykeaz: we want good junglers for our boy wangs.
[3:53:39] skyree1: I'm from Australia, we have universal (public) health care and private. Our taxes are higher and our doctors/nurses are paid less. Wait times can be long, but you have the option of using the private system which is quicker. The public system is designed to catch people that cannot afford healthcare.

[3:55:27] barren_wuffet: Hes COOKING
[3:55:32] direpants2: how is xin getting outfarmed and outganked?
[3:55:33] Midgeton: the TLDR on healthcare for anyone not willing to go do their own research... universal healthcare is SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive than the private sector insurances we currently have. There have also been a multitude of studies refuting the claim that healthcare provided takes longer in universal healthcare countries. Anyone using canada as an example is stuck in an echo-chamber because canada literally has the longest wait times period.
[3:56:14] Kudosa: Akali is aids to play against
[3:56:16] MissMountainGoat: @Midgeton at the end of the day, they're not exclusive, you will still have both and you choose if you want to pay a premium for private or not.
[3:56:59] Kudosa: probably
[3:57:31] Midgeton: @MissMountainGoat absolutely, and you're right I shouldn't generalize that universal healthcare is better in all instances. Its just embarassing to talk about the US's health care system with arbitrary prices and a predatory repayment structure.
[3:57:42] barren_wuffet: Getting potshotted by akali while shes being a rat in her shroud is a very noose worthy experience
