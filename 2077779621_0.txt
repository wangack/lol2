[5:49:35] Balldropper: maybe cuz vs orn
[5:49:37] BaneBladeV: Scared smolder
[5:49:38] AkshanSama: stacking is easy against ornn
[5:49:57] Raktagino: If you had to chose between getting 3.5 hrs sleep now and not being able to nap later, or stay up all night and do what you need to do early AM, and napping for 5 hrs, like the latter has to be the better option right?
[5:50:07] AkshanSama: wurf
[5:50:48] vlone098: @raktagino is this the situation ur in
[5:51:07] Raktagino: @vlone098 you could say yes haha
[5:51:09] vlone098: Do the latter tbh
[5:51:17] AkshanSama: @Raktagino if you split the sleep into 2hrs now and 1 hr later that would be more optimal, you can look up biphasic/polyphasic sleep schedules
[5:51:21] Kiraff: yone offpick for azir  ig

[5:51:54] Raktagino: @AkshanSama ill look into it
[5:52:26] Kiraff: was the ward the problem or smolder E revealing area
[5:52:28] AkshanSama: i used to do smthn similar to davinci, but less extreme, just did 3x 2h naps a day and it was really good for production
[5:52:36] Kiraff: cuz i think smolder was the one to reveal you
[5:53:01] vlone098: nah it was warded @kiraff
[5:53:03] kaiserwroth: thresh baiting to see how desperate you are monkaHmm
[5:53:07] vlone098: smolder e doesn‚Äôt reveal if no vision
[5:53:10] Raktagino: that reminds me of a specific polyphasic sleep schedule some guy came up with where he would sleep for an hour then stay up 2 hrs and just do it all day every day
[5:53:12] AkshanSama: @Raktagino most interesting is davinci's sleep schedule
[5:53:33] Raktagino: kk ill check that
[5:53:40] AFKfae: i had the stream muted and i didn‚Äôt even realize for a bit because my brain started to make up the game sounds

[6:28:06] archimedes_9: @alucardsanlol for riven?
[6:28:17] Keesofer: i like your tft because even though you dont play it alot you are very good at learning and not blaming the game
[6:28:24] Keesofer: alot of streamers i watch in tft just blame game
[6:28:28] BaneBladeV: Prayge positive player
[6:28:41] archimedes_9: i feel this set got boring kinda quick idk why
[6:28:47] archimedes_9: it was fun at the start
[6:28:58] BaneBladeV: yeah for me it was fun for a month
[6:29:05] Keesofer: its nice to see when people are humble and focused on themselves
[6:29:10] archimedes_9: Learning
[6:29:19] AFKfae: the lack of the .5 update with the set going on for months just bored a lot of people
[6:29:21] AkshanSama: i firmly believe riven's kit has been overloaded for too long, tho she also counters my pool so im a bit biased
[6:29:38] viiic2: viper noooo
[6:30:07] archimedes_9: yeah i feel the units and traits are kinda boring
[6:30:11] Keesofer: i liked the set but i just barely missed snapshots then quit
