[2:22:25] Ertu: @lifeisastd were you playing a tank ?
[2:22:30] lifeisastd: sylas
[2:22:46] Ertu: oh ok thats not exactly fair dmg then lol
[2:22:55] Chronoscape: u probably were underleveld and low mr
[2:22:59] lifeisastd: i was not
[2:23:00] lifeisastd: i was 18
[2:23:12] Ertu: no amount of underleveled should allow a champ to do 4k+ in 1 second lol
[2:23:12] Riddleham: I think Infernal Nasus came out in like 2015, so it's been about 10 years
[2:23:34] Ertu: Unless Ekko legit hit E+Q+Passive + Ekko ult all in 1 second
[2:23:53] lifeisastd: even then, he crit me for 2.6k lol
[2:23:57] lifeisastd: like wtf
[2:24:04] Halokazooie: I mean Ult may do up to 2k at some point very very far into the game
[2:24:19] Brackker: d cane
[2:24:26] ALLN1GHT: gg
[2:24:44] Chronoscape: @lifeisastd how much u wanna bet if u stole ekko ult and hit all ur skills with ekko ult on sylas fuill build lvl 18
[2:24:50] Ertu: @Halokazooie yea for 4k it has to be a very specific setup . Now that I think about it might be possible

[2:26:04] Chronoscape: he cant hit his ult like that llol
[2:26:07] sake_94: Ult, e,q, auto lichbane and passive prock, that can easy be that dmg
