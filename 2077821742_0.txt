[0:28:08] YowdhPaLM: This rengo is more focused on kills rather than the actual fights.. which is why they are losing.
[0:28:56] knowndepth: teemo cant play vs that comp
[0:29:00] knowndepth: doesnt matter runes
[0:33:58] Sarnyroth: Pog Electrocute stream? PauseChamp
[0:36:56] ipav999: !title Back to grinding with Teemo.
[0:36:56] Nightbot: @ipav999 -> The stream title has been updated to: Back to grinding with Teemo.
[0:42:56] BanekBBX: @ipav999 what do you think about 5 mask build?
[0:43:56] BleedinGum: !mastery
[0:44:07] BleedinGum: eh:p was hoping it would show mastery points:p
[0:45:19] BleedinGum: You ever start with Doran's?
[0:45:23] LtChezo: ipav has a ton of accounts, it would be too hard to gauge how much mastery he has
[0:45:31] teemolingus: pta its always the answer uwu
[0:47:33] LtChezo: teemo with a team
[0:48:43] teemolingus: @ipav999 and the drake? force tp
[0:51:55] LtChezo: liandrie kata is interesting
[0:54:06] mazinourek23: !speak Can Taimo carry this one ?
[0:55:27] wsanwsan: lol right before ipav killed kat, advertisement!
[0:55:43] BanekBBX: nice game, 2 kills every minute Kappa that is why league sucks
[0:55:58] LtChezo: viego?
[0:59:00] franko420_: KEKW
[0:59:09] LtChezo: they grouping hard this game
[1:02:53] LtChezo: you also dont have flash
[1:05:02] BanekBBX: @ipav999 is attack speed still a thing?
[1:07:50] teemolingus: start it
[1:08:36] BanekBBX: Vayne: Guys plays with me please
[1:08:52] BanekBBX: also Vayne rushes and dies
[1:10:11] Rici1983: socabergGg
[1:10:24] teemolingus: its ipav still a thing? Kappa
[1:10:31] BanekBBX: but there was build on teemo with kraken, rift, nashors etc.
[1:10:42] LtChezo: they removed attack speed in season 10 dont you remember ipav?
[1:11:37] LtChezo: ipavLick
[1:11:58] Sarnyroth: I think he's asking if the onhit build is still strong.
[1:12:09] BanekBBX: Does teemo still build attack speed build kappa
[1:12:12] matheusgusmao00: Id like to see some tankmo, would u do it in the future?
[1:12:31] Sarnyroth: @matheusgusmao00 Heartsteel being bad means no more tankmo Sadge
[1:12:32] chimpchange_: Kappa
[1:13:02] LtChezo: like a full on hit build
[1:13:18] BanekBBX: hahahah Kappa
[1:13:26] teemolingus: @ipav999 cuando sera el dia que escuche tu intro en español?
[1:13:37] kurufeemo: Ive not been building nashors this season. And its been fine, but im only at 7.5 cs / mknute on average
[1:13:45] Sarnyroth: KEKW
[1:14:04] fartnitesux619: when do u build malignance
[1:14:31] kurufeemo: @teemolingus i know a bit of latin, so let me guess. Does it mean "how many days have you been studying Spanish?"
[1:15:19] teemolingus: @kurufeemo ahhh... nope its when will be the day i will listen your intro in spanish Kappa
[1:15:25] antroz92: Thats spanglish for u LUL he wants to hear u in spanish when startin stream. Like greeting everyone LUL

[1:17:23] Sarnyroth: Malignance gets worse with smarter enemies, and gets better as they get more dumb YEP Smart players will buy sweepers and more control wards.
[1:18:42] BanekBBX: On-Hit Teemo is the best, no one can proove me wrong gg
[1:19:09] Sarnyroth: PepeLaugh
[1:19:24] kurufeemo: @banekbbx the scaling are still ap and not attack speed
[1:19:25] ankur10: ankur10 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:20:07] BanekBBX: @kurufeemo there is no scaling if game ends in 20 minutes
[1:21:20] Suicidallangel: gwen mid
[1:21:34] antroz92: When u find out surrender@20 is outdated monkaS
[1:21:41] kurufeemo: @banekbbx this way you are gonna sit at 50% wr
[1:21:42] matheusgusmao00: Is PTA good against Gwen?
[1:22:03] teemolingus: @ipav999 what about to say: bienvenidos al stream del main taimo no toxico? Kappa
[1:22:18] LtChezo: oh janna top
[1:22:41] kurufeemo: Teemo is often impactful enough to win at 20 minutes consistently @banekbbx thats what i mean
[1:22:57] kurufeemo: Later on though, teemo has a lot of potential
[1:23:17] pandasquadron69: do you play grasp at all this season
[1:23:54] 派教授博士先生: dingdi216
[1:24:01] BanekBBX: Aatrox so rude
[1:24:30] kurufeemo: I play ghost. But i do believe phase rush is a bit too much. With phase rush you could also play no flash if you already have ghost
[1:24:54] BanekBBX: @ipav999 how do you decide to choose phase rush over fleetfoot?
[1:28:51] BanekBBX: So is there any list of champs which you would consider going fleetfoot?
[1:29:50] BanekBBX: if you commit and dont kill, you are screwed for some time\
[1:30:08] LtChezo: i think you cant give up the 2% shard coz lots of the other toplaners take it then outrun teemo
[1:31:35] antroz92: Why not upgrade the pot?
[1:31:46] matheusgusmao00: I remember when u used smite to Never Miss A Cannon Minion ipavHappy
[1:31:52] antroz92: Nooo got an ad
[1:32:07] BanekBBX: he walked
[1:32:27] BanekBBX: maybe ulted to get there
[1:32:29] antroz92: Po. Upgrade. U dont like it?
[1:32:35] antroz92: Pot
[1:34:17] matheusgusmao00: Shen could ult aatrox now
[1:36:12] antroz92: Lol
[1:38:51] antroz92: 7/1 kindred
[1:43:45] StayMiIked: ap malphite is so unfun to play against. i would dodge if not for another 24 hr lockout

[1:53:48] RekoXXIII: Asol
[1:53:53] RekoXXIII: Too
[1:54:38] Suicidallangel: when unstopable olaf can get blinded?
[1:55:08] Sarnyroth: @suicidallangel nope, have to wait out his ult
[1:57:00] Sarnyroth: 3/0 Ashe pog
[1:57:07] Sarnyroth: Maybe winning bot lane
[1:59:48] akteemo: GJ Teemo
[1:59:59] Suicidallangel: hahahah
[2:00:22] Aldurfus: yeah seen pw do it a million times KEKW
[2:01:32] Sarnyroth: Should be ez win
[2:01:38] Suicidallangel: ashe is what remained of frozen mallet
[2:01:59] Sarnyroth: Ashe so fed she can just gun down Olaf when he runs to her
[2:02:52] Infinity_Angles: the graves said ff

[2:05:33] Sarnyroth: Or like, Brand
[2:06:06] Infinity_Angles: if the support is enchanter,yeah
[2:09:25] Suicidallangel: opinion about promos been removed?
[2:09:43] Infinity_Angles: his name only riven
[2:09:54] Infinity_Angles: or only knows riven
[2:10:07] Sarnyroth: Good name apparently
[2:10:16] Sarnyroth: Judging from his Olaf gameplay
[2:10:25] Suicidallangel: none covers me thanks
[2:11:55] akteemo: Are you Back to Gm yet on your Main?

[2:17:30] akteemo: It used to be 95
[2:17:36] akteemo: :P
[2:17:53] maligant123: i Watch your stream for almost 10 years now, and I also watch mancos stream sometimes. first of all - thanks for that - I made it to d2 as otp teemo, because of just watching you and learning. when I’m trying to compare your playstyles, you have the better dodge skills, single outplay 1v2, and manco groups more and makes plays with his team
[2:17:59] Sarnyroth: Most ppl seem to like this season but its the first one thats made me stop playing in a while. I think I just got tired of champion bias.
[2:18:05] maligant123: maybe it’s also because he’s a jungler
[2:20:36] Tsundokus: Tsundokus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 66 months! 
[2:22:59] LtChezo: i feel like its hard to solo carry on teemo, no matter how fed you are, you may as well roam and get you team fed instead
[2:23:09] maligant123: tp would make sense then, but teemo with tp sucks kinda
[2:25:22] maligant123: it’s risky, roaming, like it could work out or not, can’t rely on your teammates,
[2:25:41] maligant123: going for farm and turrets - you know it’s 100 %
[2:26:00] LtChezo: yeah i get it teemo has bad roaming, but even if you are 10/0 on teemo its gonna be hard to carry when your the rest of your team is losing
[2:27:17] Varelico: 4 marksman comp
[2:27:19] Varelico: So close
[2:27:28] Varelico: just needed ashe support and akshan mid
[2:28:04] Aldurfus: tf or zac
[2:28:05] Sleepwalking94: Zac top
[2:28:06] Varelico: not xin zhao or zax top?
[2:28:06] droxxerino: ye tf top nasty
[2:29:35] Sarnyroth: I remember a few rare iPav Quinn games
[2:30:05] Infinity_Angles: tf just want to w stun kite you after he bought rapid firecannon
[2:30:49] Sleepwalking94: Karma top?
[2:32:19] Varelico: Over time they gradually pushed a lot of champs away from unorthadox builds
[2:32:29] Varelico: See AP tristana for example
[2:33:00] Sarnyroth: Sadge i miss playing Belveth Support
[2:33:10] Varelico: @Sarnyroth Camille support is the new hot thing
[2:33:40] Sarnyroth: Yea it almost makes me want to play again. I like playing Camille outside of top
[2:33:58] Varelico: Better enjoy it while supplies last
[2:34:08] Varelico: probably will get nerfed out of it
[2:35:12] StayMiIked: ap yi
[2:35:15] StayMiIked: ap ez
[2:35:24] StayMiIked: ap trist
[2:35:27] StayMiIked: rip
[2:35:45] StayMiIked: they cant be fun like dota
[2:35:53] Sarnyroth: Meanwhile Katarina can still build whatever she wants and 1v5 games kek
[2:35:58] Aldurfus: heroes of the storm KEKW
[2:36:10] BanekBBX: AP Tryndamere
[2:36:14] Varelico: Funny enough AD/AP sion got turned into a tank during his rework. AP pantheon. They always say "we dont want to kill these alternate builds" and then they just outright gut them
[2:36:28] Varelico: AP ezreal
[2:36:48] Varelico: Magic pen darius Kappa
[2:37:02] Sarnyroth: Magic pen Mundo was funny
[2:37:32] Varelico: I complained about it too mainly because I had been following your teemo builds and mythics kinda strangled variety
[2:39:05] Sarnyroth: Lots of champs should have variety if build options, or nobody should have any. I hate the champion bias that Riot has. Kaisa and Kata can build almost anything they want and still win.
[2:39:08] Varelico: OK stridebreaker was broken but counterpoint, adcs kept galeforce
[2:39:17] ZinedineZamdane: imagine riot saying mythics are gonna bring more diversity to builds in the game ended up being the most strict meta in terms of build
[2:39:19] nucularspider: that was broken af
[2:40:51] Varelico: @ZinedineZamdane I can't believe they didn't see it when they suggested the system. I immediately thought "this will just funnel people into the best mythic for their champ"
[2:40:57] ZinedineZamdane: yeah no more divine sunderer
[2:41:04] Sarnyroth: I wish I shared iPavs optimism Sadge
[2:41:17] Varelico: Sundered sky exists and the divine sunderer champs dont build it
[2:41:22] Varelico: Hilarious
[2:42:35] ZinedineZamdane: @Varelico that just show that they don't pay attention to the game and just read a bunch of stats to balance the game wich is pure nonsense and it shows that they don't really play the game
[2:42:54] StayMiIked: holy shit
[2:43:14] Sarnyroth: Like seeing Irelia do that makes me not want to play lmao
[2:43:19] Sarnyroth: So gross
[2:43:21] Varelico: Who do you perma ban now instead of irelia?
[2:43:33] Aldurfus: no ban
[2:43:36] Sarnyroth: @varelico he hasn't been banning anyone recently
[2:44:18] Varelico: Well thats interesting
[2:44:21] Sarnyroth: And she lives again. Very cool champion.
[2:44:48] ZinedineZamdane: wukong is a toplane main no jungler ganks top that often
[2:45:18] StayMiIked: beemo auto atks are satisfying to listen to.
[2:45:19] Sarnyroth: I smell dead Taimo soon
[2:45:52] Sarnyroth: So so close
[2:47:18] Sarnyroth: Very talented player
[2:47:24] StayMiIked: man im so jelous. i never beat irellia
[2:47:24] Sarnyroth: Irelia brain
[2:48:14] Infinity_Angles: irelia dunno play,she can use ulti to slow u and insta q and taking the advantage of her ult slow to make her e hit easier so she can q twice
[2:48:42] Sarnyroth: She let herself get poked down so much too
[2:48:49] Veszta: yeah he already ulted
[2:48:50] Veszta: dw
[2:48:51] StayMiIked: bush warded
[2:48:52] DigitalKaizer: yes karthus ulted at the start of that fight

[2:50:00] StayMiIked: that ire is flaming her jg right now in chat hahaha
[2:50:02] Infinity_Angles: YEP
[2:50:13] Sarnyroth: Irelia isn't hard to play, she's just dumb.
[2:50:20] Varelico: It started with level 1 E
[2:50:34] Sarnyroth: Well you are very good true. But Irelia is still not hard.
[2:50:46] Trombomb20: i mean she is playing dumb tho
[2:51:03] Sarnyroth: We might get to see wholesome Irelia Botrk oneshot powerspike tho
[2:51:18] Varelico: Earlier in your lead it was still workable for her to get a kill. Now its more of a canyon and how she plays matters less
[2:51:26] Sarnyroth: ^
[2:52:09] Varelico: If you count the R presses as ganks its 3 times
[2:52:15] Infinity_Angles: karthus focus farm and ult to ks KEKW
[2:52:46] Sarnyroth: So balanced
[2:52:49] winace95: Ouf

[3:09:56] StayMiIked: NA pros are worthless dogwater. tyler 1 told me so.
[3:10:09] Asheetomalph: maybe riot desnt allow the item set files
[3:10:10] StayMiIked: oh
[3:10:40] KarmicKnight: might just be because they don't want to be reliant on them
[3:11:00] lifeisastd: @StayMiIked he was mad tongiht lol
[3:11:16] StayMiIked: @lifeisastd was actually funny
[3:11:19] Infinity_Angles: @lifeisastd every stream KEKW
[3:11:20] whuazgoodnjaggah: Numbering items only works when you'^re using items sets @ipav999
[3:11:23] KarmicKnight: I could see it being a way to build bad muscle memory
[3:11:56] whuazgoodnjaggah: Using item sets as a one trick is very good but if oyu play many different ones it's not as convenient
[3:12:14] StayMiIked: pro gamers are inherently lazy, this is the most likely explanation
[3:12:29] Sniper_High: Is it not a preference?
[3:12:33] whuazgoodnjaggah: Of course you can have different item sets, but that's a lot of work to maintain, hence why I said it's not as convenient
[3:13:02] luckyduckyplucky: @whuazgoodnjaggah lazy Kappa
[3:13:06] whuazgoodnjaggah: Convenience in life ;-)
[3:13:17] StayMiIked: do item sets work on riot accounts? maybe they dont sync for some reason
[3:13:18] Infinity_Angles: garen monkaS
[3:13:39] whuazgoodnjaggah: For example I use the "show all items" and then I have a "muscle memory" for it
[3:13:48] LtChezo: are they allowed to use the competition computers before they get on the stage? and even then id assume there are more important things to change like some keybinds and settings
