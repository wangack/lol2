[0:17:52] harmlessdonut: yes. lets time a 4 second cooldown
[0:17:54] PrayWMe: !thinking
[0:17:55] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.

[3:08:39] katmosk: reallyy u cant brute force trynda?
[3:08:42] Adrealiine: @VTVtheNousagi Being a main trynda (E1/D4) I think he's countering really well Trundle imo
[3:08:48] hoebac1: @VTVtheNousagi he will be fine, but the odds given to rest of the team - not in favor
[3:08:54] PluviaAeternum: @katmosk it's a flip, if he crits it's over
[3:08:55] Faulenzer130823: @Issa_Skoobs you win against jax basically always, as soon as he starts with his E just run around, and if the E stops, just start attacking him, take extra tenacity against him
[3:09:18] katmosk: @PluviaAeternum ohh
[3:09:23] Issa_Skoobs: @Faulenzer130823 I think the actual hardest match up for trundle is tf top
