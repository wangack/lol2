[2:51:12] GettingStickae: @Glgforlifebro TRUEEE
[2:51:21] tchiper950: @WilliGOAT He pinged many times about helping for contesting Blue already. And it was a bait against both Belveth and  Yasuo, tho. But Aatrox just refused to join the fight. That's the reason why Dantes died in here. So, Aatrox is not right.
[2:51:25] Rigadoons: @1v9magick this game a good example lol, laner will ask you to play it slow and then cry about how you were useless and powerfarmed all game xd
[2:51:26] i_love_composure13: DinoDance is no longer fat LETSGOOO
