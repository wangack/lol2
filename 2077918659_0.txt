[3:41:31] georgejasons: that xerath is clean on his stuns
[3:41:34] zgalucard: dude Xerath actually crazy champ
[3:42:06] Chrisssan: that sylkas let adc face tank  enemy team instead of engaging.
[3:42:08] lolkotek: eboyxerath?
[3:42:17] TeddyTheRipper: why is the hud 1/3 of the screen?
[3:42:29] Chrisssan: sylas is kda griefing player. he can one shot enemy jg, but nooo lets kalista die first then runs away
[3:47:40] im_perrito: !uptime
[3:47:40] Nightbot: Viper has been live for:  3 hours 47 minutes 46 seconds

[3:48:03] McMorms: lmao
[3:48:18] Chrisssan: is that xerath ghosting?
[3:48:35] Chrisssan: i dont think its scripting but that perfect ult EVERY TIME is suspicious
[3:48:48] yutipa: perfect? in what sense
[3:48:50] Gershua: any riven games today boss
[3:49:02] VtheVictim: @Chrisssan The only place they can be is baron
[3:49:06] Chrisssan: @Gershua hes abusing vayne before nerf. i like it tbh
[3:49:17] loltimal: hows new terminus
[3:49:17] eziboi1: terminus
[3:49:18] yutipa: are they nerfing vayne?
[3:49:27] McMorms: why nerf vayne she like the worst adc
[3:49:42] VtheVictim: @McMorms Vayne is OP top and ADC rn
[3:49:42] yutipa: @McMorms check top winrates
[3:49:42] Chrisssan: jaksho?
[3:49:45] Gershua: i assume the nerf for top lane not adc
[3:49:49] Unreal_fps: shes 52% wr s tier in 2 roles
[3:49:58] Unreal_fps: with broken scaling
[3:50:07] Unreal_fps: shes broken bot lane also
[3:50:30] McMorms: brah she suck bot so easy to abuse early
[3:50:51] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[3:51:28] Unreal_fps: @McMorms yet her bot wr is almost the same as her top wr
[3:52:21] 1_Qss: kalista no guinso its ok?
[3:52:28] Chrisssan: @Unreal_fps thats because of engage support like maokai or nautilus, not because vayne is strong
[3:52:42] Unreal_fps: no its because vayne is strong
[3:53:00] Chrisssan: @Unreal_fps pple think stats show everything individually, you ever heard of correlation with cascading effect? you're wrong
[3:53:02] Unreal_fps: stats dont lie every other adc has these supports also and arent s tier
[3:53:09] aysannn17: using what over what
[3:53:35] Unreal_fps: I dont think stats show every thing but you havent given me a good reason why the stats are wrong
[3:54:19] VtheVictim: @Chrisssan If this were true, every ADC would be 52%+ wr then tho?
[3:54:30] yutipa: @Chrisssan yeah i like how u mention correlation yet u forget other adcs also have exact same correlation with other supp winrates and that means that vayne is better with supports that are currently meta. and solo. so. ur point is what

[4:00:23] AkshanSama: @Viper at 20:00 the redbuff wouldn't have upgraded into voidborn because it was already draconic, only after it respawns (I read the wiki)

[6:20:23] moosE3knucklE: yes what pyke did was stupid. but the game wasn't completely over. bot side is sad yeah but top was winning. but people just give up on 1 bad lil play.

[6:21:20] AntcliffLIVE: did u see the riven S key stuff omran
[6:21:23] aphye: its bc of top lane
[6:21:27] DLabyGmr: and the nerf does not even solves top vayune issue, it just makes vayne bot worse
[6:21:36] dhaboutnetenpremium: they didn't nerf damage its only Ms and cd on Q
[6:21:43] xiaoxiaobby: she just depends on cc support
[6:21:46] ZephyrWings: Best decision this season to nerf her top lane. Thumbs up to riot for that. Long overdue
[6:21:56] yaBrad: why is that
[6:22:05] mital25: what can riot do to made vayne a botlaner again ?
[6:22:13] srtty_lol: they need to nerf toplane
[6:22:26] srtty_lol: they have to do anything they can to stop me from getting rank 1 from quad
[6:22:34] komtilbakke: they are nerfing vayne in general imo
[6:23:15] aphye: i just hope they keep ezreal broken
[6:23:16] spatdbo: wtf u want to give scailing champ a good early game? @Viper
[6:23:18] TokiL: vayne s tier 52% win rate nerf pls LUL
[6:23:20] dhaboutnetenpremium: she have low hp but too much movespeed and invisiblity wdyym
[6:23:21] aphye: i am enjoying my ezreal games

[6:25:03] Chrisssan: riot addressed vayne W and runnan long ago. they are never making W multi target
[6:25:28] k_legendar: hi Viper! <3
[6:25:40] n0miie: who are you watching?
[6:25:43] ZephyrWings: I'll ask you this. Do you like playing vs vayne top
[6:26:14] sexinuggets99: they didnt need to nerf vayne just nerf ghost
[6:26:15] k_legendar: all good, how is gameplay going today?
[6:26:20] AntcliffLIVE: just pick akshan into vayne its unloseable
[6:26:31] lifeisastd: vayne top is a perfect example of why league is self-inflicted torture.
[6:26:43] Moddeex: I like that the solution to vayne top is other adc champs
[6:26:45] AntcliffLIVE: fleet needs a nerf tbh
[6:26:48] sexinuggets99: remove ghost
[6:26:56] Dav3Schneider: just make it where you have to choose between flash OR ghost
[6:27:07] aphye: its hard to rework vi and vayne bc of their w's
[6:27:07] SushisRolling: NOO THE PENTA
[6:27:18] k_legendar: Yesterday I played against a Caitlyn top with Vayne
[6:27:26] DLabyGmr: just remove ghost and tp from the game, and increase death timers by 10s. I am asking for too much? xD
[6:27:29] k_legendar: Kinda unplayable early game
[6:27:33] ZephyrWings: Oh OK then because I play riven and in my elo d4 I have no junglers so I can't do shit. But when I jungle and am vs vayne top I do not let her breathe without my approval
[6:27:56] jaxinsux: we cant hear vid btw
