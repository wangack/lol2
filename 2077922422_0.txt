[0:06:21] Nightbot: 5upL
[0:06:25] lil__soupy: is there a smolder debuff?
[0:06:46] celerykelery: i miss ezreal league of legends </3
[0:07:15] lil__soupy: also 5up did you watch the pokemon presents? they announced a new legends-like game for 2025
[0:07:25] pureiinsanity: eyymer
[0:07:38] Fr4gp4rty: @namesbond_007 yeah, sometimes lectures like that are hard. Had one last semester in civil procedure law and it was just so much material to learn. 360 min of lectures per week
[0:07:45] CoyoteTina: I hate when you get good at a legend an then they nerf the shit out of them
[0:08:15] lil__soupy: it's based on the kalos region, so a lot of people are excited because mega evolution might be back, which might be contributing for the exciting
[0:08:27] lavfully: it’s severely disappointing
[0:08:31] NamesBond_007: @Fr4gp4rty oh yay sounds like imposible to get full points
[0:08:34] lil__soupy: Legends Z-A
[0:08:49] lavfully: i mean how little effort pokemon puts into their games
[0:09:02] lil__soupy: no, it's like how legends arceus was ancient sinnoh
[0:09:12] lavfully: just a trailer, no gameplay footage
[0:09:36] NamesBond_007: i think its the nostalgia
[0:10:02] The_Moep: I mean it's a switch game, they can't do much on that lol
[0:10:10] lil__soupy: i mean they are also giving themselves more time, its rare for pokemon to go a year without releasing anything
[0:10:14] Elley00: Hello <3
[0:10:38] CoyoteTina: My favs were Pokemon Lets go Pikachu, and Sword.
[0:10:42] Fr4gp4rty: @namesbond_007 yeah, at the exam i read one question and just thought: im not gonna get this one so i might aswell collect more points on the other essay questions
[0:10:44] lil__soupy: also its speculated that it will also be released with the new switch console since it says it will be coming to all switch consoles
[0:10:49] lavfully: i think most people like legends arceus for the lore and gameplay, not so much the visuals
[0:10:57] lil__soupy: ^^
[0:11:20] The_Moep: heard a good chunk of streamers share that sentiment tbh
[0:11:27] Nightbot: 5upL
[0:11:30] lil__soupy: i'm betting on europe
[0:12:02] lavfully: something’s gonna keep you in america

[0:15:01] cakebird: wait lav did you change your user?:o
[0:15:02] 9fierce9: Letsgo, I can see 5up tilt off the face of the earth on league from the comfort of my home
[0:15:03] CoyoteTina: @lil__soupy have fun with that.
[0:15:16] lavfully: i think you’re good at storytelling
[0:15:20] olavi14: Basically the same artist
[0:15:25] Evuszka: you should start journaling
[0:15:25] Sol_Bebe: hi 5up hi chat!! slpyWave

[0:17:10] lavfully: i’m trying to gratitude journal more
[0:17:51] lavfully: anyone tried training themselves to lucid dream? i failed xD
[0:18:31] CoyoteTina: @lavfully its an interesting experience when it happens
[0:18:31] NamesBond_007: my dreams are either just being in total dakness the whole time or druget up nightamers games-cos i only have lucid dreams
[0:18:33] The_Moep: I did for a while but it got too exhausting
[0:18:44] CoyoteTina: Can’t make it happen but it does sometimes
[0:19:03] Fr4gp4rty: I sometimes do lucid dream but not on purpose
[0:19:25] lavfully: the moment i realize the time/day in a dream i wake up
[0:20:31] NamesBond_007: its not fun for me, cos it more like desicion game, or roleplay, fuly lucid dream are sop tyriing

[0:33:38] NamesBond_007: i dont care that much cos i dont watch it, are there any problems?
[0:33:55] cari141: Oh yeah, plz get to GM :)
[0:34:08] Sol_Bebe: gta rp can definitely be fun for the viewers and the streamer.  but the community as a whole for rp can be be really prone to back seating, toxicity, chat hopping, etc
[0:34:12] Halofan642: eve isnt gonna buy a sweeper
[0:34:44] NamesBond_007: @Sol_Bebe oh, thaats unfortuned
[0:34:49] pureiinsanity: orb
[0:35:08] Sol_Bebe: I’m a fan of watching gta rp, but the chat stays fully closed regardless of the stream I’m on because the chat can get loaded with stupid people
[0:36:04] Sol_Bebe: mods in gta rp streams have a whole ass workout timing people out for going after a streamer for what their character in a game is doing as rp
[0:36:22] Nightbot: 5upL
[0:36:58] Sol_Bebe: lots of rp viewers forget everyone is acting and playing a character at the end of the day in gta rp
[0:37:05] NamesBond_007: @Sol_Bebe oh no, this chat would be suffering a bit
[0:37:18] dorboria: sad
[0:37:28] CoyoteTina: @sol_bebe Thats why I’m glad Jonas doesn’t do that kitdyKEK We’re chillin when he plays Palworld, on Val we get some.. interesting chatters but its chill usually
[0:38:00] NamesBond_007: im glad
[0:38:17] NamesBond_007: i wish to nobody bad chaters
[0:38:29] pureiinsanity: i like that script level Q you did
[0:38:46] pureiinsanity: it looked like you predicted ahri R
[0:39:03] Sol_Bebe: your whole team seemed to take turns messing up with their plays
[0:39:16] 9fierce9: just simply be better smile
[0:39:23] CoyoteTina: Warm up game. Next one you got for sure stormrngWiggle
[0:39:41] kurseppp: this reminds me why i quit league
[0:39:48] Halofan642: brands pretty broken yeah
[0:39:56] Halofan642: zyra jg is also sleeper imo
[0:40:12] Halofan642: oh no, i know, he probbaly had rylaids liandryrs
[0:40:14] Halofan642: rylais*
[0:40:27] Halofan642: oh, when he gets rylais it also slows too its so annoying
[0:40:29] NamesBond_007: would you be interest in dnd on stream 5up? just curious
[0:41:08] Halofan642: brand first couple clears were pretty difficult when he first got made a jungler, but other than that its pretty easy
[0:41:16] Nightbot: 5upL
[0:41:17] kurseppp: pool party caitlyn !!!
[0:41:56] Fishpaste1: well they made brand jg one of the fastest clears just because they felt like it
[0:42:54] Halofan642: i liked brand jg when he wasnt blatantly overtuned
[0:42:56] Fishpaste1: yes
[0:42:59] Halofan642: its plyaed in lpl
[0:43:04] pureiinsanity: i personally think Zyra is even worse
[0:43:29] Halofan642: it was played in lec a bit too
[0:43:35] nemartoh: zyra jg is op rn
[0:43:39] Fishpaste1: zyra jg is also being played
[0:43:39] pureiinsanity: no they aren't different roles
[0:43:40] Halofan642: zyra can jungle now too PepeLaugh
[0:43:54] pureiinsanity: she has fastest clear in the game
[0:44:05] Halofan642: they buffed her damage to monsters, i havent tried it yet but she is probably pretty strong
[0:44:16] 9fierce9: wat
[0:44:19] Fishpaste1: they changed the jg pet so basically everyone can jg decently
[0:44:22] Halofan642: her clear is like somewhat hard tho compared to other junglers (its still not hard, just harder)
[0:45:00] Halofan642: yeah but they also buffed zyra for her plants to do extra damage to mobs
[0:45:03] pureiinsanity: you should learn her
[0:45:12] Fishpaste1: the reason is because not enough of the playerbase plays jungle
[0:45:22] Fishpaste1: so they are trying to fix queue times by making jg easier to play
[0:45:22] NamesBond_007: isnt it cos not that many people play jungle
[0:45:27] Halofan642: i dont think you played when they buffed non junglers to jungle a season or two ago, it was like darius/morgana/etc and they said it was so non-junglers could feel comfortable learning to play jungle
[0:45:38] pureiinsanity: @5up you can flex her in like 5 roles whats the problem xd
[0:46:06] 9fierce9: Is Tristana the biggest counterpick to Malzahar?

[0:46:35] Halofan642: you have the ability to influence every lane, so your laners always assume you shuold be ganking *their* lane
[0:46:58] nemartoh: junglers think they're grandmaster chess players that have to control 5 people at once like its an rts when they're usually epstein cosplayers on evelynn or kayn
[0:47:54] 9fierce9: That is indeed a message that is sent in an online chat room holy christ
[0:48:35] NamesBond_007: it is true but for min i thouth im having a stroke
[0:48:45] 9fierce9: Im going to send that message to my league friend and see what he thinks bout it KEKW

[1:35:32] Whyin_: FH is just strong I think vs AD
[1:35:34] wisla1: probably not happening as much anymore after nerfs, but it was just insane op in terms of gold value for a bit
[1:35:36] Whyin_: so matchup dependant I imagine
[1:36:14] wisla1: it also gave mana which always feels good when he doesnt build lost chapter items
[1:36:26] Nightbot: 5upL
[1:37:23] Halofan642: showmaker went PoM when he went grasp liandrys

[3:09:30] Pyronorm: Darn. It actually showed 3 months, then when that notification left showed 4 months. Was hoping to "notify" twice in a row that I subbed.
[3:09:37] PoteetLee: I did have turbo and then they raised the price.
[3:09:49] sharffffff: i literally only watch 5up or some game announcements on twitch
