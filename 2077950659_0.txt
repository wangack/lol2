[1:06:57] bmccrabb: that’s like 1/3 of a small drink
[1:07:00] f1r3st4rt3r: f1r3st4rt3r subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Us old men don't fuck with convenience fees, no sir

[1:16:34] LunaVelika: the botlane experience
[1:21:08] TitusGroen: omg
[1:21:23] TitusGroen: I can't believe janna survived
[1:22:32] Shreiner: thank you for your service, saint
[1:22:45] MaverickMan909: ok
[1:24:07] perfectbalance198: i dont know but ashe supp is troll pick
[1:25:16] MaverickMan909: plus if ur adc is trash then you become the adc Kappa
[1:26:09] Shreiner: blue kayn is kinda disgusting
[1:26:31] tastycales: recently been having fun with ashe sup but her build path is a bit boring
[1:26:34] LeiteroMasta: jungle plays for top and top loses anyway classic
[1:28:21] LeiteroMasta: i think this one might be over
[1:28:49] MaverickMan909: modCheck carry?
[1:30:18] MaverickMan909: winnable Pog
[1:30:25] MaverickMan909: KEKW

[1:34:05] LunaVelika: LUL
[1:34:40] TitusGroen: What are some match ups you don't want to play Ashe support? I don't play it enough to know
[1:36:13] TitusGroen: NOTED
[1:36:21] MaverickMan909: indeed ok
[1:36:39] TitusGroen: Yeah that makes sense. I gave it a try and we were rocking them but then their jungle came and ours didn't and RIP
[1:36:56] MaverickMan909: catJAM
[1:37:15] forsake23: catJAM
[1:37:33] TitusGroen: True, I'm just bad LUL
[1:38:20] FalcoMajor: I always struggle with how to balance being aggressive in botlane with playing safe and not dying to a gank
[1:40:01] TitusGroen: Have you played against the aggro Janna? The build with hail of blades and all the movement speed items to max the on-hit autoattack damage?
[1:41:05] TitusGroen: It goes for swifties, imperial mandate into shurelia's
[1:41:56] Shreiner: do you still play jungle or mostly just support now?
[1:43:21] MaverickMan909: its not the same k6 is it?
[1:46:13] Quapamooch: These are some tasty jams, where can I find these excellent tunes?
[1:47:28] MaverickMan909: worth
[1:47:37] tastycales: how nice of this j4
[1:47:50] Shreiner: j4 doing what he can to balance out the loser's queue
[1:47:52] Shreiner: xD
[1:47:56] tastycales: shows up to give some extra 300 to go base
[1:48:14] Quapamooch: !music
[1:48:17] That1locoo: senna re roll just took the game against kayle re roll
[1:48:17] ConcussiveBlast: The classic? I thought that was 0-7 RIP Brazil. Keepo
[1:50:56] Shreiner: ashe is now the support Kappa
[1:51:12] delavor1: good shit
[1:52:39] bypster: What's your rank rn?
[1:52:49] delavor1: went through like 2 summoner spells thats huge
[1:55:23] Shreiner: isn't that blossom item pretty disgusting on her too?
[1:58:03] casiebot: the classic throw to give them hope
[1:58:25] corneusx: bro was stuck
[1:58:28] MaverickMan909: turret MVP this game
[1:59:15] Shreiner: has j4 died to anyone else?
[1:59:22] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:00:16] casiebot: ksante is massive
[2:00:49] That1locoo: !gamble all
[2:00:50] StreamElements: PogChamp That1locoo went all in and won 610 Saints PogChamp they now have 1220 Saints FeelsGoodMan
[2:00:55] casiebot: shutdown onto asol would be huge
[2:01:20] osprey6: hey santa
[2:01:23] That1locoo: lvl 11 a sol now, hes gonna scale... hopefully
[2:02:40] Shreiner: she needs 5 more deaths until she hits her power spike
[2:03:14] That1locoo: I think Gwen is a very underwhelming champion, she is only good in arena now.
[2:08:50] FalcoMajor: Every time I see a ksante he is unkillable after 20 minutes
[2:08:59] HedgehogOfHermes: saint did you ever do programming?
[2:10:03] nomadic_hobo: Saint can I hire you as my PT
[2:11:00] TitusGroen: LUL
[2:11:30] TitusGroen: I just like cross map Ws with Swain
[2:12:12] LeiteroMasta: is hwei support doable?
[2:13:30] itsDoppel: I feel like support APs need Liandrys
[2:14:04] TitusGroen: He's got some OK cc but he has so many abilities that it feels like balancing him must be a nightmare.
[2:15:08] TitusGroen: yeah friday
[2:15:22] wilsonao: Let's blast some Rebecca Black
[2:15:48] wilsonao: Chat wasn't even born yet then Sadge
[2:15:53] nomadic_hobo: Your chat is fulla old timers
[2:15:57] itsDoppel: Need lyrics to this song.
[2:16:16] Shreiner: makes sense because %health true dmg
[2:16:34] Shreiner: LOL
[2:17:19] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:18:48] TitusGroen: Not the Liss NotLikeThis
[2:19:04] Surpriseigloo: Liss has the built-in Zed R cancel... but I don't love that matchup other than that.
[2:19:13] KyleKyleArgyle: I don't think Liss can ever kill Zed
[2:19:26] Surpriseigloo: she needs a gank early to make it happen.
[2:21:00] TitusGroen: Weak side Swain specialists
[2:22:18] Surpriseigloo: tough lane to actually gank... Janna the forever peel. And smolder... if he saves his flight shit, has an easy out. Maybe if you guys can trade well enough early, it's a good gank
[2:23:02] Surpriseigloo: nice, going on yone,
[2:23:37] TitusGroen: The janna loves taking Es
[2:23:56] Surpriseigloo: that wave was brutal.
[2:24:01] Surpriseigloo: He took so much minion dmg
[2:24:31] TitusGroen: yeah Jhin decided sitting in that massive was a great idea Sadge
[2:25:13] TitusGroen: jesus that's LEVEL 1 W??
[2:25:21] TitusGroen: I thought you needed a few points in it
[2:25:56] TitusGroen: damn you're hitting all the Es this game
[2:27:49] Surpriseigloo: good roam from janna
[2:32:12] Surpriseigloo: 6 grubs pretty solid
[2:33:16] TitusGroen: this janna loves throwing out useless tornadoes
[2:34:19] TitusGroen: get a good scrap, everyone collapses RIP Madge
[2:34:27] Surpriseigloo: and she still dies
[2:37:04] Szain3: DinoDance
[2:37:15] Surpriseigloo: Myabe it's just play around yone now
[2:38:05] TitusGroen: the bush cheese, you had to see it
[2:38:26] Surpriseigloo: is liss filled?
[2:38:34] ArthGrimalkin: One of these days, mang CurseLit  follow up on our team was a bit slow
[2:39:42] Surpriseigloo: you mid is a supp main
[2:40:06] Gelnarx: Is it time for you to decide which side is weak *wink*
[2:41:31] chairmannetero420: janna strong ofc ppl will pick it
[2:41:37] Surpriseigloo: playing janna is boring af
[2:41:46] chairmannetero420: i disagree
[2:41:46] TitusGroen: Yeah both those janna games were the movement speed janna build I've been seeing. But without the hail of blades.
[2:42:13] chairmannetero420: janna just a fast champion
[2:43:20] Surpriseigloo: You had 2 stand out decisions... leaving the big wave to crash into your turret, and then playing to smolder on drake fight... but other than that it was pretty solid.
[2:43:43] Surpriseigloo: the slow lvl6 really hurt.
[2:44:14] Surpriseigloo: he positioned really poorly in a few trades, which is magnified playing jhin
[2:44:25] NeviaCh: i miss yee olden days of saint hard random jungle
[2:44:28] fatescha: what rank?
[2:44:41] Surpriseigloo: he's master 80;ish LP I believe
[2:44:51] TitusGroen: Aight let's see if run into the same janna again
[2:44:54] Surpriseigloo: @NeviaCh he's gotten some jg games last few days
[2:45:16] NeviaCh: @Surpriseigloo  i mean the hard random jungle says
[2:45:23] TitusGroen: wtf does that even mean
[2:45:26] NeviaCh: days*
[2:45:29] NeviaCh: god were old
[2:45:38] Surpriseigloo: @TitusGroen right LaundryBasket
[2:45:57] corneusx: bring rene nida back
[2:46:16] NeviaCh: how is jayce vs attrox MU
[2:47:31] forsake23: pugPls
[2:48:35] Gelnarx: nid can lvl 3 gank you no?
[2:50:39] wilsonao: 1 game closer to Against the Storm
[2:50:58] LeiteroMasta: it's a doomed angle
[2:52:20] wilsonao: yeah but think of the PERMANENT ULT
[2:55:42] TitusGroen: that sucks lol. "I'm out! Oh no a bear!"
[2:56:04] wilsonao: League players really have no macro sense anymore
[2:56:45] wilsonao: when it 6/3 we take those

[3:05:45] DM_MonkeyMan: DM_MonkeyMan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! An interesting choice they have made
[3:06:13] TitusGroen: Fighting Nid in jungle where she can just chuck spears down corridors is just an oof.
[3:06:18] TitusGroen: You zoned them off her so hard
[3:07:14] Johie: Do you remember Shushei?

[3:15:28] aaoxtreme: gg
[3:15:44] SwazilandPrince: with malig and swain, does it trigger just on the activation of the ult or just first time it deals dmg to a champ? doesn't proc with the activation and the burse does it?
[3:15:58] d3afhead: tft FeelsWeirdMan
[3:16:21] trentogorgon: a ringing endorsement
[3:18:01] wilsonao: heartsteel in tft became heartsteel in aram Sadge

[3:18:23] TheZim: gold*
[3:19:10] GildedTuna: I felt like this set the carries were also hard set, there was barely any weird shit, try winning with carry gragas, wont happen
[3:20:17] McShnizle: Which set was a 10 out of 10
[3:20:23] LucasRulzZ: ur jungler is KIMCHI Pog

[3:30:38] raptora87: broken somehow
[3:35:11] FangHighwind: you underestimate the throw capability players have
[3:35:14] d3afhead: unless she over extends and gets hooked
