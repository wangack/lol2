[0:43:49] demon1_lol: @Jackspektra Do you think if azzap was on enemy team he would still keep trying his best even if 2 inhibs are open ?
[0:43:49] Marekseuw: oh u mean that tonic
[0:44:01] TauschungTCG: @maxozabojca99 I know why, i'm wondering why he didn't take it
[0:44:02] n_sstam: is it your build that u have almost 100% win rate with kai sa or u are just so good? @Jackspektra
[0:44:05] Xyh_lol: imagine u had tonic and point in W at 11 tho
[0:44:06] Dekharen: Do you like the idea of going just full AP ? Cryptbloom/Zhonya + Rabadon makes you so insanely strong but not having E evolve can be annoying against lockdown CC
[0:44:13] lolmalice: this has been the same game quality as my last 5 games
[0:44:17] lolmalice: really enjoying soloq, good practice lately
[0:44:32] Chipez: Im not sure if Kaisas build variety is a positive thing. Seems like a jack of all trades master of none situation. Could be wrong.
[0:44:42] Tonirel: ggs bro, I wish we had a normal game
[0:44:45] TauschungTCG: I wanna learn either Kalista, Draven, or Aphelios, any recommendations on which one?

[1:06:51] Faramir1993: @RukiHyena because it`s bad on smolder?
[1:06:55] Filthy_Ningen: @n7konstantine The most important thing is the Q upgrade you get on lvl 9
[1:08:04] RukiHyena: @Faramir1993 is it tho? if you play the scaling game and still build reletivly tanky i feel its still a great item, and if you dont take double manna rune it can replace your reaver

[1:32:37] Nelumbs: I hope tyler's child is a Sona/Seraphine main that runs barrier
[1:33:08] noc077: you can skip a few sec
[1:33:16] 420stupidloud420: that excuse makes them feel better that they lost
[1:33:25] Sanfuunz: tarzaned thinks he is a victim everytime first blood is drawn against him
[1:33:28] confuzzled_z: yea but if i played as much as him i would prob develop this amount of cope too
[1:33:41] 420stupidloud420: true lmao. its how he stays sane i guess
[1:33:47] purpsizzurp: at the level he's at he garners a greater proportion of trolls though
[1:34:11] 420stupidloud420: the aatrox has 550g bounty so idk if hes a troll. just a bad play
[1:34:13] JuiceePlug: bro got 3 shot

[1:36:37] Durmanush: LUL
[1:36:40] Dekharen: ngl at 40 min into the game that's a bit painful to watch
[1:36:43] confuzzled_z: bro lost his mind
[1:36:52] xai1: Im with Tyler on this one

[1:37:19] toms_tomato: dayum thats mean
[1:37:19] confuzzled_z: @xai1 what does that even mean tho? that u should be allowed to say those things
[1:37:25] purpsizzurp: jack rant incoming
[1:37:37] Durmanush: Jack would have the nicest rant
[1:37:46] 420stupidloud420: tyler1 and taking it too far? who would have thought
[1:37:50] Moodkindred: wish lb luck at mcdonalds when game ends
[1:37:56] Satsmo: you know the tiktok sound "brother eww" :D you had that kinda face
[1:38:01] Durmanush: true
[1:38:01] JamieLyubenov: LB is a god dw
[1:38:03] confuzzled_z: its true
[1:38:04] hiimkiri: D:
[1:38:06] xai1: @confuzzled_z he said he inted 7 kills fighting fiora for ego and lost tyler's game
[1:38:29] sharpstud: sadly true, but tyler is the last one to even talk shit about people griefing
[1:38:48] JuiceePlug: oh it happens in the nba
[1:38:53] 420stupidloud420: to call someone who made it to the LCS a failure is crazy
[1:38:53] confuzzled_z: @xai1 doesnt make what tyler says okay? feel like this is a concept league community just doesnt care abt
[1:38:53] theblasphemer666: people flame professional athletes all the time as well
[1:39:00] Halfalfa: what about people who are skilled enough to go pro but dont ?
[1:39:10] JuiceePlug: teammates gets toxic in the nba when they actually do dumb shit
[1:39:37] confuzzled_z: its like when ppl flame mad lions players in the context of eu based on internationals
[1:39:45] lolmirai: but dont a lot of them just choose to stream for more money and less stress
[1:40:02] Halfalfa: @lolmirai exactly what im thinking, i agree theres very few people though
[1:40:04] sengo_b: think tfblade has lcs offers and diclined them
[1:40:09] sengo_b: had
[1:40:11] HouseElf7: dopa
[1:40:17] 420stupidloud420: tfblade Pepega
[1:40:21] Durmanush: didn't you do this before
[1:40:28] Beeecker: skain Pepega
[1:40:30] Dekharen: Kinda Ratirl, but yea it's giga small
[1:40:33] Halfalfa: ratirl had LCS offers a few years ago if i remember correctly
[1:40:36] calin2110: i mean nemesis couldn't find a good team could he
[1:40:36] BigCeda: Caedrel

[1:41:00] Sanfuunz: lets go
[1:41:06] Durmanush: 8 bot 4 mins lets go
[1:41:09] Dekharen: @BigCeda he cancelled his career PepeLaugh
[1:41:12] theblasphemer666: @solstario finally a real answer
[1:41:16] Nelumbs: normal playerbase are allowed to criticize but I think it has to be valid criticism. not whatever t1 was doing there
[1:41:16] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[1:41:19] sengo_b: @420stupidloud420 he legit had an offer from golden duardians 4 years ago but chose streaming
[1:41:31] gulle1337: Whats the diff between lec and lcs
[1:41:33] calin2110: what's the context? what did T1 say/
[1:41:36] noc077: @sengo_b no
[1:41:51] confuzzled_z: @gulle1337 one is one team region thats very washed and the other is lc
[1:41:51] Halfalfa: what do u think of the manamune ap build vs the eclipse one ?
[1:41:52] confuzzled_z: lcs
[1:42:12] calin2110: @confuzzled_z better a one team region than a no team region no?
[1:42:18] Halfalfa: yh T1 went way too far
[1:42:28] confuzzled_z: @calin2110 just let me cope man
[1:42:40] gulle1337: G2 is lec or lcs?
[1:42:41] mono_brown: nothjing that happens in a league game makes you a "failure at life"
[1:42:46] xai1: @Jackspektra oh thats twohoyrz he is a good player tho
[1:42:53] Nelumbs: the niles thing is t1 lashing out
[1:42:54] sengo_b: yeah thats harsh to say to someone that hasnt made it
[1:43:18] calin2110: can someone fill me in with what tyler said?
[1:43:30] Dekharen: He was just being rude as usual
[1:43:36] scanderlout: But he always does this what's different in this case?
[1:43:38] confuzzled_z: he knows what hes doing when he says those things in front of his audience
[1:44:01] LapisLazulies: im d2 peak is it fair for me to feel like i have a shot beating low masta players
[1:44:10] LapisLazulies: if i tag them in a ranked game
[1:44:20] confuzzled_z: when it comes to low masta
[1:44:21] lolmirai: i remember seeing a plat player shitting on a master 200 player she met irl and calling him cringe for calling himself decent at the game
[1:44:22] AGENTAU123: taliyah using sprint LUL
[1:44:23] confuzzled_z: anythings fair game
[1:44:23] Anyealator: vod review

[1:45:04] HylightShow: dont eclipse kaisa need cull for evolve or are you going another ad item?
[1:45:05] xai1: @Jackspektra ok chill out now jackspektra we are getting offended right here
[1:45:08] 420stupidloud420: its like streamers calling pro players bad lmao
[1:45:31] sandrooo_ar: i was diamond last season and this season im stuck emerald 4 i swear this elo is way harder than diamond
[1:45:36] themerki98: Thatâ€™s just people without personality that repeat mindlessly what challenger streamers say
[1:45:43] ToneDoLOL: hii ratJAM

[1:46:14] mono_brown: I just think everyone is making tons of mistakes all the time, and it is so much easier to see them outside of the pressure of the game
[1:46:15] Dekharen: Kaisa really wants lockdown cc :(
[1:46:24] AMBIENCE00: @420stupidloud420 A pro player isnt deemed to be a better soloq player than a streamer though
[1:46:52] Dekharen: Yeah I mean so many streamers just dont care at all about what they say or do and don't realize the effect it has on the community
[1:47:02] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!
[1:47:40] Dekharen: An easy one, that isn't really of his own doing, but is Baus inspiring a plethora of gold players to legitimately run it down because they have no idea how he gets his gold leads LUL
[1:47:42] confuzzled_z: what is the build u are going?
[1:47:42] mono_brown: 100x easier to detect errors while spectating
[1:48:15] confuzzled_z: @Dekharen yea its too late now tho
[1:48:44] confuzzled_z: the community will be fked until the end of the game
[1:49:18] Dekharen: not really. I think the vocal part of the community is, but the vast majority of league players don't even play ranked
[1:50:03] petersen_lol: is your ult an aa reset?
[1:50:07] confuzzled_z: ye
[1:50:27] confuzzled_z: @Dekharen true i forgot abt the non ranked ppl
[1:50:34] Dekharen: I like the R + W while you R combo but it's tough to pull out correctly
[1:50:37] baum13_: eclipse kraken is quite good
[1:51:06] baum13_: usually after that you go rageblade since kraken rageblade combo is bonkers but wits end works
[1:51:13] confuzzled_z: @Dekharen how do u aim it? might be dumb question
[1:51:24] eqdiu1451: hahahaha
[1:51:30] Dekharen: Soraka stuff LUL
[1:52:41] Dekharen: @confuzzled_z basically your animation starts while you're r-ing so it's the direction your cursor is in while ulting; with proper timing you can do it so the w comes out right at the end of your R
[1:53:00] live_jamie: hello guys
[1:53:22] confuzzled_z: @Dekharen so u aim it as u would if u w'ed right after ur ult?
[1:54:06] confuzzled_z: o wait nvm i get it
[1:54:36] its_rekky: best senna build right now?
[1:54:38] Dekharen: @confuzzled_z yeah but if you hit W too early it won't have exactly the same angle. You can go try it out in practice tool, it's a funny mechanic, but it's hard to do properly in game
[1:55:04] confuzzled_z: bomba
[1:55:08] live_jamie: that lee is on crack
[1:55:41] Dekharen: CANWIN
[1:56:34] AMBIENCE00: Ad...

[1:57:01] giannismay: is kaisa playable ?
[1:57:02] live_jamie: btw idk if someone said it already but ive seen a tweet from this NA LB otp Bobqin who  said just play LB bot its broken so maybe thats why your support picked LB this game
[1:57:21] Dekharen: he shun like the lightning, and for about just as long LUL
[1:57:49] AMBIENCE00: Low chance euw players copying NA
[1:58:14] stinkyfone: is twitch a good kaisa counter?
[1:58:14] live_jamie: yeah looks like the build

[2:20:51] ADCPurple: they just cycle the cc as well its crazy
[2:20:58] bolqvinio7: is it good to get extra long sword for q evolve?
[2:21:02] ADCPurple: Cleanse is needed but feels useless anyway
[2:21:19] TheFlamingTiger357: is it a banshee angle?
[2:21:26] svezz1: cc --> cleansed --> ccd insantly
[2:21:26] erland199: @bolqvinio7 not since he is going into Nashor and he gets q evolve next lvl
[2:21:33] RukiHyena: maybe there's a reason tf adc wasnt meant to be a thing
[2:21:36] Nikushaa: they should lowkey reduce kaisa evolve thresholds but only make stats from items count
[2:21:57] ADCPurple: They wont do that because 100 is good number
[2:21:58] MykEEL1: top 3 adc de este parche jack?

[2:24:12] erland199: what am i watching xdd
[2:24:25] MarZen8: xdd
[2:24:30] RukiHyena: serpents fang would do allot this game, with the lifeline items too
[2:24:31] paafegal: not their best games
[2:24:43] erland199: talented individuals
[2:24:51] Nikushaa: tell ali to drop the ego and buy serpents xdd

[2:29:54] borog785: Fang doesnt work against maw

[2:33:15] xcalebur: are ye winning son
[2:33:15] TheFlamingTiger357: yone sej and Ali are brain ded they can build the anti heal
[2:33:22] Nikushaa: kaisa fifth auto having a different animation is the biggest cancer no?
[2:33:37] erland199: @Nikushaa its satisfying
[2:33:44] MikuChan1998: MikuChan1998 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Jackspektra LEC 2025
[2:33:50] xcalebur: why does jacks team need antiheal so badly?
[2:33:51] SingularFish: Hey Jack I'm on the verge of swapping to ADC, getting bored of suppo in Em. Should I just spam Jinx to learn how to position and farm?
[2:33:54] Nikushaa: it is but it's not worth the clunkiness, it has different timing
[2:33:56] xcalebur: it looks like antishielding is needed
[2:34:01] xcalebur: but i only just got here
[2:34:06] Dekharen: @SingularFish just don't play the role OMEGALUL
[2:34:22] SingularFish: Dekharen Despairge
[2:34:24] Dekharen: @xcalebur he's building serpents fang rn
[2:34:36] xcalebur: ya but someone said its disgusting 3 of his team dont have antiheal
[2:34:40] exist999_: @SingularFish why wouldn't u try mf first? o.O
[2:34:50] xcalebur: i dont see the antiheal requirement
[2:35:23] erland199: yeah this yone is allowed to talk after losing lane to Karma
[2:35:24] RukiHyena: shields are still massive LUL
[2:35:32] SingularFish: This was a game
[2:35:35] Nikushaa: insane ur mid is typing 24/7 when he's just as dogshit as sej
[2:35:35] MikuChan1998: @SingularFish not worth it
[2:35:46] paafegal: tragic, also enemy champs seemed like fun to play vs
[2:35:51] Dekharen: @SingularFish to answer your question, pick up one laner that likes to scrap in lane (kaisa, draven, that kinda thing) and one hypercarry like jinx or aphelios, botlane is a lot about knowledge matchup anyway
