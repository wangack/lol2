[2:16:56] matheusgusmao00: as a former mono adc, do you recommend play normals to main teemo/toplane until I master it so I can switch to rankeds?
[2:17:25] YouAreCuteXD: norms are useless
[2:18:08] Breathe234: they are great for learning a new champ though :)
[2:18:18] matheusgusmao00: It's because 1 little mistake costs the entire top lane, I feel bad when team mates flame me  cause I know I screwed up
[2:18:25] Bea_ts: Cómo vas con el español?

[2:19:29] matheusgusmao00: I have m7 with teemo, but I lack toplane experience
[2:19:32] Kashyy: and they do that in ranked anyway lmao
[2:20:07] Breathe234: @matheusgusmao00 i'd try one normal at least and then ranked, depends how much time you have I guess, and your objective
[2:20:07] Bea_ts: Why not LATAM spanish?
[2:20:44] YolkBun: if you want to troll then it is better to troll the ranked players ipavClown
[2:20:54] Bea_ts: @YolkBun Agree
[2:20:56] YouAreCuteXD: is all latin american spanish the same? is it not different between countries?
[2:20:57] pikapika_666_: :)
[2:21:23] Bea_ts: @YouAreCuteXD When it comes to dub, it's generalized
[2:21:40] Breathe234: @YouAreCuteXD each country / region has their own dialects and accents, and even other languages
[2:21:44] Bea_ts: But still different from Spain Spanish
[2:21:59] YouAreCuteXD: so which country is the league one most similar to?
[2:22:08] ElArieloEnTwitch: @youarecutexd there’s a difference from spanish from spain than from latin america
[2:22:20] CookieJarPink: DR spanish #1
[2:22:21] Breathe234: @YouAreCuteXD I think this one is the Spanish from Spain version
[2:22:26] YolkBun: people are more angry in the ranked ipavAngry
[2:22:27] pikapika_666_: I think Brazilian derived from Portuguese.

[2:22:46] Breathe234: @YouAreCuteXD there's a LATAM version too but iPav preferred the female announcer of the Spanish from Spain version
[2:22:51] YouAreCuteXD: yes but i mean which is the latam one most similar to? which country?
[2:23:01] Bea_ts: Mexico
[2:23:12] YouAreCuteXD: i guess that's not surprising
[2:23:17] ElArieloEnTwitch: xD
[2:23:18] Breathe234: @YouAreCuteXD ahh. i can't remember, and he only did it for one game, sorry
[2:23:19] Bea_ts: No haha
[2:23:25] 514484: in normal you are at the mercy of first timers and 3-4 premades
[2:23:34] 514484: it's not small
[2:23:44] YouAreCuteXD: being paired with a 4 man premade is the epitome of suffering
[2:24:20] pikapika_666_: goku has
[2:24:30] Bea_ts: @pikapika_666_ Are you talking about the population or the language?
[2:24:38] pikapika_666_: language
[2:24:40] YouAreCuteXD: my neighborhood mostly speaks spanish. i wonder which dialects are the most common. colombian, probably
[2:24:55] YolkBun: ipav only has one mode -> ipavBoomer
[2:24:57] yungmoneyhashregister: maybe you meatbags dont but i, a superior artificial intelligence do
[2:25:37] YouAreCuteXD: they do the same in aram too. it's just aram
[2:25:59] pikapika_666_: someone needs a massage
[2:26:25] Bea_ts: I enjoy playing ARAM only
[2:26:26] Bea_ts: And TFT
[2:26:36] YouAreCuteXD: i just don't like norms cause being with 3 and 4 man premades sucks
[2:26:36] 514484: i won't first time shit in ranked, that's a major difference
[2:27:48] YouAreCuteXD: as a former aram main, i don't understand what this first timing is
[2:28:49] Bea_ts: @YouAreCuteXD x2
[2:30:40] YouAreCuteXD: gragussy
[2:31:01] 514484: 4 premades cannot be trusted, they have major ego issues and they don't listen to calls
[2:31:44] YouAreCuteXD: didn't they just change him a lot to try to finally kill him for pro?
[2:31:47] 514484: DansGame

[4:26:51] matheusgusmao00: he had mental lag
[4:35:05] cisnerosebastian: @ipav999 I got a question about Teemo R. Lets say you dont have any items on inventory, and you put down a shrrom. Then go back to base and buy. Does that shroom you've placed before scales with the new ap you just bought?
[4:35:16] sorrobou: yes
[4:35:23] sorrobou: it's current char ap
[4:36:34] Sak0w: yes , if you buy morelo or liandry after someone walked on the shroom it apply too
[4:36:40] 514484: that zhonya, why :(
[4:36:57] cisnerosebastian: what about the DOT? you apply DOT (basic attack) die, and buy? does that DOT scales with the item you bought dead?
[4:37:07] Sak0w: yes
[4:37:19] cisnerosebastian: lol, that is like cheating
[4:37:19] Lazynameross: and stops you from refunding
[4:37:29] 514484: no it's not
[4:37:34] 514484: it's extremely minor
[4:38:21] Lazynameross: and homeguards peepoSad
[4:38:22] manbrasucks: 2 more deaths, perfect teemo score
[4:38:35] cisnerosebastian: you just killed axir (EZ healed him). If you bought quick enough maybe azir was dead, right?
[4:38:51] Sak0w: if you buy shadow flame or storms when you die it does extra dmgs and gives you kills sometimes
[4:38:52] sorrobou: that was so well played by the two of you... wow
[4:39:40] twitchsuckstoday: when to buy shadowflame is my dilemna
[4:39:58] Sak0w: sry, I do in aram
[4:40:15] maligant123: maybe hail of blades against jayce?
