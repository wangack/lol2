[0:48:10] Floral_Sloth: reminds me of old nitrome games
[0:48:29] kuaren_windcatcher: what I meant that I hope they are going to use the minesweeper mechanics better instead of adding too many  other gameplay mechanics
[0:48:30] tsunami11_cr7: @Floral_Sloth now that's a name i haven't heard in a long time
[0:48:33] isanh: @HibuHibu you can take multiple hits and there  are healing items, so you probably have to take some hits

[1:14:31] NIKOvbn: ayo?
[1:14:34] Hoompter: This looks to me like one of the most creative games I've seen lately. The idea of taking something as simple as the minesweeper and making a more complicated and story driven game out of it is brilliant
