[3:53:35] ackihuru: turret should hit
[3:53:35] Amaresu_: he s just him
[3:53:36] ackihuru: 100% of time
[3:53:37] rhati1: tower shot was hitting minuion already
[3:53:39] Umbracious: AA as soon as tower autos a minion
[3:53:41] heaven_Chuu: Probably because he hits when tower is already shooting minion
[3:53:41] T1Tesko: Hes just him
[3:53:42] entergehenna: turret shot just came out'
[3:53:43] Amaresu_: he delayed it
[3:53:43] adnanmyname: rigged
[3:53:45] Amaresu_: and got fleed proc
[3:53:48] Umbracious: you see tower aggro him
[3:53:49] painfulfap: He got lucky with tower time

[3:53:49] Amaresu_: fleet *
[3:53:53] Umbracious: he just gets out of the way in time
[3:53:53] Amaresu_: yup

[3:55:52] Amaresu_: @ackihuru now you just practice and apply it
[3:55:52] painfulfap: Wait this build is strong as fuck
[3:55:59] Amaresu_: this build is the most snowball build i swear
[3:56:04] Amaresu_: its not highest dps but its giga burst
[3:56:06] brandnschafftu: smoulder is in it
[3:56:08] heaven_Chuu: That damage is not okay wtf
[3:56:08] Massi_: i think i like the build xD
[3:56:12] Lunarmorii: why is his screenlock so weird
[3:56:13] Amaresu_: and snowball potential with Q auto sheen proc and move speed to chase
[3:56:15] Umbracious: its a good build if youre going fleet into squishy comps
[3:56:23] Umbracious: might be before nerf idk
[3:56:25] Amaresu_: if you go fleet
[3:56:26] jaxinsux: does anyone know the aatrox guy who viper usually watches with the same music in evvery vid
[3:56:27] Amaresu_: you go storm
[3:56:28] frog21x: its a game from 3days ago
[3:56:28] jaxinsux: korean or china
[3:56:30] Amaresu_: to synergize
[3:56:30] frog21x: u can look
[3:56:32] frog21x: his op gg
[3:56:40] T1Tesko: @viper its from 3 days ago
[3:56:41] lol_shadowofchains: There's smolder in the game it has to be recent no?
[3:56:42] lolkotek: space god
[3:56:46] Amaresu_: fleet + storm, or pta + kraken/bork vs tanks etc
[3:56:53] kceburst13: smolder there so must be new
[3:56:54] exokind: 3 days ago
[3:56:57] exokind: was that game
[3:57:03] exokind: so maybe it is broken
[3:57:05] heaven_Chuu: Time to find the match history
[3:57:10] Amaresu_: nah that channel makes videos every day
[3:57:16] T1Tesko: its the 12/3/1 vayne game from 3 days ago
[3:57:18] Amaresu_: it has to be from last 24h
[3:57:21] Amaresu_: oh
[3:57:43] heaven_Chuu: That damage was inhumane go for it
[3:57:43] Amaresu_: but you have to go fleet with stormrazor
[3:57:46] frog21x: but what u go 2last items?
[3:57:46] Umbracious: stormrazor is good if you have fleet
[3:57:48] Amaresu_: and play for spacing
[3:57:55] Amaora: @Amaresu_ this build feels so amazing
[3:58:00] Amaresu_: yeah its nuts
[3:58:02] Amaresu_: BUT
[3:58:03] KKrazy81: viper what can i do to beat ur vayne in lane
[3:58:07] Umbracious: also good vs teams you cant really auto consistently
[3:58:10] Amaresu_: you cant make any mistakes with it
[3:58:12] Amaresu_: cause its lower dmg
[3:58:16] Amaresu_: lower dps **
[3:58:19] jaxinsux: @Viper who is the aatrox player youve been watching in queue, or what YT channel
[3:58:22] Amaresu_: its more burst and going in and out with movement speed
[3:58:24] Amaresu_: and chasing
[3:58:27] KKrazy81: yeah i was the riven last game
[3:58:33] Amaresu_: but its overall less dps than kraken/bork pta into guinsoos etc
[3:58:36] Amaora: ill be honest, what that amount of MS, its not too hard to space well with it tbh
[3:58:51] Amaresu_: nothing you can do vs vayne as riven man, dont sweat it, you need jg.
[3:59:00] Amaresu_: stop blinding riven if you wanna climb xD
[3:59:13] painfulfap: its clean but not as clean as mine

[4:08:57] xamikkaze: yi we believe in you
[4:09:11] TheCoffeeCurator: yi focus on the game bb
[4:09:14] Amaresu_: @fr3efi if that doesnt happen you need to wait for lvl 3+, at lvl 4 especially if you can get on him you can 100-0 him but its dangerous, if you dont he can kill you, he does omega dmg. also depends if he has fleet or pta.
[4:09:14] Umbracious: 3 longsword start on yi this game is over
[4:09:20] Umbracious: dagger*
[4:09:45] Amaresu_: @fr3efi but the #1 thing about akshan is that you should know that you can block his E. so when you re gonna be looking for all in you have to angle yourself ahead of him towards the direction he wants to E to block it.
[4:09:52] astro___wolf: @Umbracious nah u need 2 for krake and 1 for  boots
[4:09:54] Amaresu_: if you block his E he s dead especially after 6
[4:10:34] Amaresu_: if he s really good he ll go fleet and rush tabi and makes things harder but you can always kill him. look to extend Qs always ofc and burn his boneplating before looking for all ins if he runs it - he should run it @fr3efi
