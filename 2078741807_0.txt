[3:51:18] leagueoflegoboy99: ipav teemo . i tried electrocute with lich bane first item and did good
[3:51:20] SzDredd: tbh it does not so much different
[3:51:34] leagueoflegoboy99: what ur thought lichbane first with electrocute
[3:51:38] SzDredd: if it had Diablo look they may get sued LUL
[3:51:40] moosasa: Its a smaller game studio i think
[3:51:43] TausendSonnen_: was the first release from that studio
[3:52:52] SzDredd: I wouldn't judge the look if it not max quality
[3:53:36] SzDredd: Cosmikator is not here LUL
[3:55:09] SzDredd: you played this
[3:55:29] antroz92: survivors
[3:56:53] SzDredd: if there is a negative review in the first 5 it has a flaw
[3:57:12] Proverbs_: that game is amazing'
[3:58:23] SzDredd: Currently it's the running away simulator, especially on higher difficulties. You practically never feel strong enough to kill the swarm until you at the later levels. So you spend most of the run running away.
