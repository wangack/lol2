[2:52:23] wilfrLd: dreaemSus How do we know Faker isn't scripting?
[2:52:52] ss3pervysages: faker is a script, the most advanced android ever
[2:52:56] Datous: Datous subscribed with Prime.

[2:54:33] Flarezard: @Telperion16 i-
[2:54:35] softlysupports: who said dis notveryowo
[2:54:37] vrgambit: Because if a support says anything people on social media thing they're a dumb egirl or an f word tbh
[2:54:43] Gioforkyra: tiktok is so dumb
[2:54:43] vrgambit: Think*
[2:55:20] vrgambit: Owais I said the quiet part out loud rofl

[2:55:42] Shanierd513: I've seen some in silver it's pretty easy to tell
[2:55:51] Flarezard: people cheating while they still can ICANT
[2:55:58] ThomasTheTwink: I can be a dumb f word and know the scripts are there cozimajj
[2:55:58] bladetrinity16: @milkayaa using cheats to avoid skillshots/hit skillshots
[2:56:03] ss3pervysages: are there any scriptures on wildRift? is the mobile game script free?
[2:56:05] flyingfort271: @milkayaa cheats/3rd party software that can many things like dodge ablities for u

[2:57:08] kaiserwroth: this ezreal Susge
[2:57:18] KaratelBanderivskyi: R.i.P :(
[2:57:37] Telperion16: scripting is basically using a computer program to press keys for you, it reads the info on the screen and executes a script so you avoid skillshots or you hit yours
[2:57:49] ss3pervysages: brand ? :O 2020Surprise
[2:58:23] YasuThePasu: is maokai still broken?
[2:58:30] shinyclodsire: they changed it so passive doesnt proc it

[2:59:36] Cybychen: @vrgambit And the yummi stigma of all supports are just sitting and not doing anything
[3:00:16] ss3pervysages: I do  wonder if any scripters removed fog of war yet because that would be tragic
[3:00:45] Gioforkyra: how do you know when to play brand

[3:16:53] InfernoBear: that‚Äôs the neat part, you don‚Äôt
[3:16:56] shinyclodsire: no need to take mental damage

[3:17:30] ZABARUD0: hiii
[3:17:32] shinyclodsire: WatchingStream
[3:17:44] archimedes_9: i think if you can't at least somewhat enjoy the game while losing then maybe you should rethink you're approach if you're not pro
[3:17:53] shinyclodsire: 100%
[3:17:57] archimedes_9: cause ~50% of the time you play are gonna be losses
[3:17:59] archimedes_9: no matter who you are
[3:18:08] bladetrinity16: my smolder winrate says otherwise D:
[3:18:15] GlacialEmbrace: does horizon focus 10% dmg increase affect the first ability hit? or only subsequent ones?
[3:18:35] shinyclodsire: i have a 10% wr on camille supp in masters nothehe
[3:18:39] archimedes_9: @GlacialEmbrace applies to the triggering ability per wiki
[3:18:43] bladetrinity16: i have uh 65% winrate smolder rn
[3:18:45] shinyclodsire: but i had fun while losing and thats all that matters
[3:19:04] Life_Forms: @archimedes_9 losing is only frustrating when it's to some OP bullshit, like TF for the last 2 months
[3:19:27] bladetrinity16: losing is the msot frustrating when its because of stupid shit
[3:19:53] ZABARUD0: best champ to have fun on even when losing is jhinn supp
[3:20:05] shinyclodsire: baseg
[3:20:25] majaisaway: can every champ be a supp?
[3:20:28] Life_Forms: @ZABARUD0 i like Akshan support for that reason, he's fun no matter what
[3:20:35] bladetrinity16: chat i got a penta today :D but we still lost
[3:20:44] confusedpanda7: karma doesn‚Äôt work with horizon right because you are running close to the enemy then RQ
[3:20:56] ZABARUD0: @Life_Forms jhin kog akshan
[3:21:08] ZABARUD0: i just lock them in and then mute all lmao
[3:21:09] confusedpanda7: you don‚Äôt get the damage bonus in that case ?

[3:22:11] som963: Dejj
[3:22:19] som963: dejj
[3:22:24] shinyclodsire: @confusedpanda7 but your Q slows them, so the hypershot passive stills goes off i think
[3:22:44] bladetrinity16: brand pressed R, its super effective
[3:22:44] TellerRyu: Headshot
[3:22:49] teemowo69: :O
