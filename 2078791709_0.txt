[5:34:39] westin1988: each game is its own. but they do have sequels, such as 10 has 10-2. @GZmosselman
[5:34:42] Chiyuhatsu: Asides from direct sequel like FFX and FFX-2 but I'll assume you know what a sequel would be. They don't try to Kingdom Heart the title or anything. And make it obvious.
[5:35:11] xHyunkelx: Just buy the Final Fantasy Pixel compilation
[5:35:13] xHyunkelx: And play those

[5:37:58] Chiyuhatsu: @honeyyyyyy 8
[5:38:20] honeyyyyyy: is this game a newer final fantasy?
[5:38:24] xDaddyxBearx: My favorite FF of all time was Legends of Dragoon Kappa
[5:38:26] PacifistPlayer: So far a good remake? @SirhcEz
[5:38:37] Chiyuhatsu: My favorite FF was World of FF Kappa
[5:38:42] TastefullyNamed: I liked the atmosphere/setting, and gameplay of 13. the story and character development though was.. lacking.
[5:38:52] fruit_dealer2: Squall was nice
[5:38:56] Schomberg939: I really enjoyed 8
[5:38:58] ireallydunnoanything: 8 was good at the beginning and then had lenghts
[5:39:03] xDaddyxBearx: @TastefullyNamed Was that the one that was all linear?
[5:39:07] negativedge99: ff8 is very werid, which is a plus for ff since they don't make any sense anyway
[5:39:17] AnimelsReal: ff8 is kino
[5:39:25] FearSide5: i think they decided at some point in ff8 development to focus more on ff9, they definitely ran out of time
[5:39:29] xHyunkelx: Best FF is Vagrant Story and FF Tactics anyways
[5:39:30] TastefullyNamed: @xDaddyxBearx it was linear until a later chapter then opened up a bit. Introduced Lightning
[5:39:30] honeyyyyyy: what game is he playing right now?

[5:39:37] FearSide5: and then during ff9 they decided at some point to focus more on ff10
[5:39:40] FearSide5: imo
[5:39:43] AnimelsReal: you think the ff8 plot is trippy and then youre suddenly in space
[5:39:53] negativedge99: everything after 8 is a bore
[5:40:05] westin1988: LUL disagree
[5:40:14] westin1988: 9 and 10 are good
[5:40:14] zamawamo: what game is this? ff8?
[5:40:15] StreamElements: @zamawamo, Chris is currently playing "FF7:Rebirth" while in queue, followed by "Persona 3 Reload". As always, he is streaming League of Legends.
[5:40:15] xHyunkelx: @FearSide5 Nope, not true at all : FF8, FF9 and FF10 all were developed alongside to one another at some point tho, that's how big Square was back then
[5:40:29] Chiyuhatsu: I mean FF10 wasn't that bad.
[5:40:42] Chiyuhatsu: FF15 also wasn't awful at the end. At the beginning though, it was rough.
[5:40:42] westin1988: havent really touched any of the ffs after 10.
[5:40:43] ireallydunnoanything: 12 was not bad too
[5:40:46] westin1988: getting to it LUL
[5:40:50] negativedge99: 9 10 and 11 were developed at the same time, not 8
[5:40:53] AnimelsReal: 12 is my favorite
[5:40:54] TastefullyNamed: 12 is amazing
[5:41:20] Shippidi: Chiyuhatsu ff15 suffered from having a movie tie-in that you had to watch in order to get the full scope of things Deadge
[5:41:26] Chiyuhatsu: Yeah.
[5:41:27] garden_grove: chocobo Pog
[5:41:38] Chiyuhatsu: I mean the game itself was alright at best. I don't hate 15.
[5:41:43] westin1988: I didnt care for the fighting system on 12 at first because it wasnt like the other ffs i had played at the time.
[5:41:46] garden_grove: I played 7-10
[5:42:00] westin1988: I didnt want to learn new battle system at the time LUL
[5:42:13] TastefullyNamed: back on its launch, one of the biggest complaints about 12 was the combat time system and it not being like the others, but multiple games after now mimic the system ha

[5:52:34] westin1988: you like it?
[5:52:38] xDaddyxBearx: @Chiyuhatsu I don't think it's that 16 was bad. But it wasn't traditional FF. And some people wanted more of a traditional FF
[5:52:41] iyohanx: PartyPls
[5:52:56] xDaddyxBearx: It was more of an Action RPG

[5:52:58] bentheklutz: casual voyage into tower range for no reason. what a power move.
[5:53:01] Chiyuhatsu: I personally don't mind it myself.
[5:53:04] xxxraticategrindxxx: @xDaddyxBearx i thought people liked ff16, have  heard praise on how square enix is telling an good original story in a world where propoganda is more important then story telling
[5:53:13] ALLN1GHT: pooHype pooChatsplain pooHype
[5:53:37] xerinox: @westin1988 which 3? NA 3? or Japan 3?

[5:53:45] xerinox: I'm talking about NA 3 / Japan 6
[5:54:01] xDaddyxBearx: @xxxraticategrindxxx Oh there was a ton of hate on 16. Most of the old heads that wanted old FF. But I am an old head and I really like the Action RPG feel.
[5:54:21] TastefullyNamed: i havent played a ff after 14, including these remakes
[5:54:22] xDaddyxBearx: It's like playing Final Fantasy as Witcher

[5:55:00] bentheklutz: kumaPls
[5:55:03] xxxraticategrindxxx: the only complaint i heard was that everyone was white in a european based world? Kappa
[5:55:23] xDaddyxBearx: @xxxraticategrindxxx Also the loot in the world was a bit meh. It just missed some of the things traditional FF has. But it wasn't a bad game at all
[5:55:28] xDaddyxBearx: It was fun and a good story

[5:56:05] xerinox: Was also quite a fan of lufia 2, even though one of the later puzzles stumped me as a kid
[5:56:06] xxxraticategrindxxx: @xDaddyxBearx ah fair, i must admit im not the ff buff i'd like to be, so i'm not sure, chocobo's make everything awesome imo :D

[5:56:20] ALLN1GHT: RainbowPls RainbowPls
[5:56:23] xHyunkelx: I really enjoyed FF16, but past the Bahamut Fight, the game goes down quite a bit in pacing and spectacle, it's strange
[5:56:30] ireallydunnoanything: KWEEEEK
[5:56:33] hirako_s: @m0ndosaur anxiety for playing ranked
[5:56:33] westin1988: Japan 3 I am finding boring as hell rn. I need to grind some levels to finish the game but I am not motivated to do so LUL @xerinox
[5:56:34] xHyunkelx: But I freaking love the story and the characters and their drama
[5:56:40] m0ndosaur: @hirako_s why though lol
[5:56:41] xerinox: Havent played much ff after 9, i am old fast

[5:56:56] bentheklutz: Orange whip? Orange whip? Three orange whips!
[5:56:58] hirako_s: @m0ndosaur Idk. fear of losing i guess
[5:56:58] xxxraticategrindxxx: @m0ndosaur it's when you are scared of starting a ranked match cause you're most likely in low elo and expect, "special" team mates
[5:57:19] westin1988: other than the online ones. yes @xerinox
[5:57:20] xxxraticategrindxxx: that's how i experienced it at least

[6:01:48] xxxraticategrindxxx: @bobsyfy nvm i stand corrected
[6:01:51] Sentety: xxxraticategrindxxx true i think yakuza side content in an ff game would be pretty hilarious but it might not fit well cause i dont think ff games are that wacky when it comes to comedy
[6:02:22] bobsyfy: did chris finish like a dragon?

[6:02:38] xxxraticategrindxxx: @Sentety oh yeah yakuza is really wacky from what i know, but you could alsways take out the comedy and still learn from how they do something
