[1:19:01] joklip_: Hey, how do you think, is sett strong this season?
[1:19:11] YEhanButterfingErs75: oh hell nah
[1:19:11] seigebrisbane: destroying his tower only made him stronger
[1:19:30] Lordekaiser23: @joklip_ if anything mordekaiser is better than sett
[1:19:37] Lordekaiser23: and that saying something
[1:19:45] joklip_: damn, thats sad
[1:19:51] tezi777: mord really strong this season
[1:19:56] xeon77x: i mean its hard buffing him, because he is doing pretty well in low elo i think... idk how they could manage it
[1:20:01] Lordekaiser23: that’s why I barely playing sett
[1:20:17] Lordekaiser23: I only play sett when morde gets banned
[1:20:28] xeon77x: maybe increase aa dmg, ms, but nerf w dmg even more? idk
[1:20:39] YEhanButterfingErs75: nah
[1:20:41] Lordekaiser23: and even then I have 0 fun nowadays playing sett
[1:20:45] sad_insanity: i got a idea. lethality mobility boots sett with predator runes
[1:20:49] sad_insanity: trust will work
[1:20:59] tezi777: @xeon77x universal q movement
[1:21:22] xeon77x: @tezi777 yes but they would have to change something else, since his low elo winrate would just go up even more
[1:21:38] seigebrisbane: demons living rent free in my head ruyuSog
[1:22:03] xeon77x: but maybe that isnt even a big buff so i guess its more like a quality of life change, so yeah could be good regardless for the elo
[1:22:03] tezi777: @xeon77x isnt it high even now?=
[1:22:05] Lordekaiser23: maybe buff his movement speed
[1:22:14] Lordekaiser23: since his movement speed is below average
[1:22:17] xDaBossx: Care to explain, Riot?
[1:22:40] YEhanButterfingErs75: will riot august Go live again
[1:22:52] xeon77x: @tezi777 i didnt look but i am pretty sure it is high in lower elo, hence why any straight buff would make it even better, but help higher elo players that struggle with sett rn
[1:22:54] Lordekaiser23: why not hexplate sett
[1:23:05] tezi777: @xeon77x thats why they will nerf him LOL!
[1:23:13] xeon77x: @Lordekaiser23 yeah i think that would be good
[1:23:20] xeon77x: @tezi777 :(
[1:23:52] sad_insanity: mobility boots would be good here... ngl
[1:23:59] Lordekaiser23: also frozen heart meta right now cucked sett hard like Adam22
[1:24:03] tezi777: we need a ruined sett skin would be fire
[1:24:21] YEhanButterfingErs75: crime city sett

[1:24:42] tezi777: @yehanbutterfingers75 like the darius one 🤮
[1:24:53] Lordekaiser23: I am so sick of riot giving Darius mediocre skins
[1:24:54] YEhanButterfingErs75: nah the theme fits perfectly
[1:25:02] Lordekaiser23: from lunar beast to porcelain
[1:25:08] seigebrisbane: GoldPLZ
[1:25:20] Lordekaiser23: like most of them don’t work
[1:25:22] tezi777: atleast we have god king darius
[1:25:36] seigebrisbane: coffee makes me poop
[1:25:42] Lordekaiser23: at least we have high noon
[1:25:55] Lordekaiser23: high noon Darius can compete with god king
[1:26:12] tezi777: @Lordekaiser23 old ass animations
[1:26:18] xeon77x: they could make a pit fighter sett skin, prior to his luxury outfit since he is the boss now
[1:26:38] Lordekaiser23: @tezi777 cool ass passive effects
[1:26:45] sad_insanity: when we getting up a skin headline called oiled up. then we get oiled up skins
[1:26:50] Brydza3: smolder sure looks balanced LUL
[1:27:05] YEhanButterfingErs75: smolder? nah i call him elder
[1:27:15] tezi777: @Lordekaiser23 true
[1:27:16] Lordekaiser23: ngl I play asol and I hate his early game
[1:27:28] Lordekaiser23: his early game is so ass
[1:27:32] Lordekaiser23: especially the ult
[1:27:41] tezi777: @Lordekaiser23 thats how he works xfd
[1:27:59] Lordekaiser23: the hit box of his ult is smaller than mizkif
[1:28:04] xDaBossx: He's way better than Kayle early
[1:28:27] seigebrisbane: NewRecord
[1:28:30] Lordekaiser23: what wrong with the references
[1:28:31] YEhanButterfingErs75: i lost 31 and gained 18
[1:28:34] YEhanButterfingErs75: its cooked

[1:29:41] xeon77x: gaining 7 sounds wild
[1:30:02] xeon77x: gotta win like 15 games in a row to rank up lmao
[1:30:12] Cold_Messiah: Early game lies of p is ass
