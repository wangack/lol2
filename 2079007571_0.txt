[2:31:04] koetxea: I mean of course its not virtually zero but its pretty close to 0 or 1
[2:31:18] Kintion: nvm is a competitive game, they have the servers in the stage
[2:31:19] TIBET1337: chat is Chatting

[2:33:28] Joghurt2317: hello there :3
[2:33:52] Vargas64825: @koetxea yeah but what u see there is not the real latency of the game, pros have talked abt it, in LCS it says 0ms and pros have said it feels like 10ms, 0ms to 1ms is not possible latency still exists
[2:34:11] TIBET1337: how's the cheff in team btw? do u like his how it cooks?
[2:35:15] yeandhi: it's normal the build is worse in soloq because of first 10 minutes fist fights
[2:35:19] GentleMattman: Hey Jack, does eclipse proc with just 1 missile + auto from Kai'Sa? or does more than one Q missile need to hit to proc?

[2:44:13] GentleMattman: the roams would be good
[2:44:59] GentleMattman: is jinx milio good?
[2:45:21] Vargas64825: @GentleMattman pretty weak lane
[2:45:27] 9markoo__: why dodge?
[2:45:43] 9markoo__: panth good sinergui with kaisa o not?
[2:46:06] GentleMattman: ah, I getcha. I just thought the AA range buff from Milio would be like really busted with jinx rockets
[2:46:18] visualsafety: how do you have proview:
[2:46:28] Crambit: Is the insta ignite worth there?
[2:46:31] GentleMattman: @visualsafety YT channel: LPL LCK Proviews
[2:46:37] Durmanush: :D that cup is tiny!
[2:46:37] Vargas64825: @9markoo__ panth is just a bad support, but yeah theres at least some synergy
[2:46:38] Crambit: I feel like it did nothing
[2:46:54] tillows30cm: is it a low fps view or recording issues?
[2:46:56] bash_adc: isn´t cait/milio terrible combo?
[2:47:03] sugarlad34: I say uts pretty standard...
[2:47:16] GentleMattman: nah Jack's just hitting +5 seconds, -5 seconds
[2:47:35] kennyECS: this game was interesting because they took milio away so TES ended up with luc/nami. Thoughts on giving milio and taking karma/cait
[2:48:20] Vargas64825: at that point is better to play cait lux instead of karma cait
[2:48:24] Saderako: yeah varus ashe is very hard to play AINTNOWAY
[2:48:25] GentleMattman: Is Ezreal Karma worth playing if I trust my skill on Ezreal (Diamond 2)
[2:48:30] bizcochitu: @tibet1337 Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:48:36] kennyECS: @Vargas64825 i wouldn't want lux into milio
[2:48:51] Bigslug333: are luc nami playing to kill at 6?
[2:49:23] Vargas64825: @kennyECS I mean in pro u can achieve everything u need from cait lux without kills
[2:49:50] DonaldMungchi: don't feel like Boneplating is that impactful in this matchup
[2:50:52] SingularFish: Favourite support to have with Draven?
[2:51:07] GentleMattman: I love Naut or Pyke
[2:51:17] fandolinaa: Renata!
[2:51:22] Vargas64825: Yuumi Kappa
[2:51:37] wxd_lol: @Jackspektra top 5 supps in soloq euw?
[2:51:39] GentleMattman: my duo is really good and confident on Pyke, so I tend to love Pyke's slippery-ness
[2:51:44] hentastichen: who was your support in LEC?
[2:51:53] Bigslug333: thresh is my fav i can overextend like a dog while he plays for lanturn
[2:53:06] GentleMattman: do you like playing with Whiteinn Jack?
[2:53:14] xai1: what are u eating
[2:53:15] wxd_lol: cait lux seems way better than cait milio @Jackspektra

[3:11:54] fugitivexdd: @erland199 because they're bad
[3:12:02] fugitivexdd: they just use scripts to make up for mistakes
[3:12:33] RukiHyena: bad players are the ones who usually scrip so it makes sense
[3:12:58] fugitivexdd: they normally have bad game sense, but abuse scripts so they're fine mechanically
[3:13:12] RukiHyena: when are we supposed to get vengurd? they keep pushing it back.
[3:13:21] Vargas64825: 14.5
[3:13:22] fugitivexdd: april i think they said?
[3:13:47] RukiHyena: for ap yea, full tank not so much imo
[3:13:53] Vargas64825: @Jackspektra yeah comet gives u solo kill potential but scales worse
[3:13:56] erland199: i think since u fight this much maybe grasp could have been better
[3:14:03] erland199: but in theroy it is the best yes
[3:14:26] TIBET1337: in 14.5 only philippines server will get the vanguard so they "still trying for other regions"

[3:59:52] RukiHyena: who your teamates live in a zoo
[4:00:00] Tcyy: @klaas1ck Like every game basically? You can go watch CSGO after 10 years.. It's the same as well ahah
[4:00:00] RukiHyena: apes
[4:00:28] klaas1ck: @Tcyy yeah that's a good point, however i wouldn't say other games are as miserable as league of legends
[4:00:52] Tcyy: @klaas1ck years and years ago I used to watch some OW - the meta would spin in circles the exact same way
[4:01:01] JuiceePlug: 40 sec cd
[4:01:08] Tcyy: Right now I'm following apex after 6 years or so - Meta is roughly the same as well aside from new champions
[4:01:40] Tcyy: It's just really hard to touch the foundamentals of a competitive game without risking losing everything - hence the perpetual circle of metas
[4:01:47] tiutangclan: swap to magic pen boots?
[4:01:50] klaas1ck: yeah but i would classify league of legends as the video games  equivalant of cigarettes
[4:01:52] RukiHyena: @Tcyy League def changes allot more than any other Esport
[4:02:17] Tcyy: @RukiHyena Does it? We were literally back to assassin meta not long ago.. ADCs going full lethality - assassins being pick or ban
[4:02:26] Tcyy: When was that again - S8?
[4:02:40] RukiHyena: @Tcyy i mean, look at other Esports
[4:02:47] xai1: pls permaban this camille
[4:02:48] xai1: Phreak
[4:02:51] SingularFish: Hate to lose these
[4:02:56] MarxistTurtle: its ok king you played well
[4:03:00] PachoNimi: Camille just had a bad game chat :)
[4:03:00] 2Sirious4u: i mean naut tried his best to lose
[4:03:15] Tcyy: @RukiHyena Nah I agree, league has more changes but I wouldn't say it drastically changes compared to other games though
[4:03:21] svezz1: unlucky game, cheer up and take some mentall reset
[4:03:24] RukiHyena: @RukiHyena unless you count overwatch as an esport KEKW
[4:03:45] 9BRYCE9: 9BRYCE9 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! W trauma dump
[4:03:56] Tcyy: @RukiHyena imo if you can play comp for money that's an esport - so hearthstone would go in that category too KEKW
[4:03:57] marssh1: why do so many pros come to ur stream ? @Jackspektra

[5:57:41] marssh1: @Jackspektra how are u supposed to play with senna support?
[5:58:01] Tonirel: D:
[5:58:05] TIBET1337: ingame obv
[5:58:11] confuzzled_z: i just need bros whole playlist at this point
[5:58:22] Nikushaa: you got 3 cs with E, that must be a world record
[5:58:25] yamigatsu: @marssh1 dodge the game, senna is an adc, why would a supp player pick an adc champ, they litteraly dont wanna play the role
[5:58:28] sprinklezuwu: Raining elder buff napalm upon them (sponsored by smolder)
[5:58:34] marssh1: LOl
[5:58:39] marssh1: fr dude it feels so useless
[5:58:41] el_danixd: but then maokai is open and we can ff atp
[5:58:51] zetsu_tryhard: i just played against cait adc and kallista support it was miserable
[5:58:59] confuzzled_z: me when my day is going amazing and i get senna support
[5:59:01] zetsu_tryhard: but we won so
[5:59:29] sprinklezuwu: My day be so fine then boom senna sup
[5:59:38] marssh1: @sprinklezuwu sameeeeeeee
[5:59:50] somiii_7: @sprinklezuwu 😭
[5:59:51] marssh1: its so dam usless
[5:59:55] marssh1: like i dont see the positives in playing it
[6:00:00] zetsu_tryhard: i lost
[6:00:21] LettuceDare: smolder actually makes farming fun lol
[6:00:31] zetsu_tryhard: name something more satisfying then stacking a milion creeps with smolder
[6:00:34] sprinklezuwu: @marssh1 She bullies enchanters well in lane and scales like crazy shes good senna supp players just usually suck ass
[6:00:42] kennyECS: senna support isn't bad. you just need your adc to lock good combo for fasting
[6:00:45] sprinklezuwu: its a situational pick thats it
[6:01:16] marssh1: yeah
[6:01:18] marssh1: that makes sense
[6:01:26] marssh1: i had someone pick it when i played varus
[6:01:32] marssh1: and i was like this lane feels so bad
[6:01:46] el_danixd: @kennyECS yes bro let me lock in tahm kench so my senna with gold adc mechanics can play her senna
[6:01:49] sprinklezuwu: varus is pretty good with her imo maybe bad matchup
[6:01:50] zetsu_tryhard: @marssh1 were u on hit or lethality
[6:02:03] kennyECS: @el_danixd that's not pick gap. that's player gap
[6:02:14] marssh1: @zetsu_tryhard on hit
[6:02:26] zetsu_tryhard: maybe lethal feels better with senna idk
[6:02:27] marssh1: i was vs mf karma
[6:02:27] el_danixd: i mean saying it isnt bad cuz it works only for fasting means it's indeed a shit pick @kennyECS
[6:02:31] zetsu_tryhard: its perma banned my lobbies anyways
[6:02:37] marssh1: maybe it was just cus of karma
[6:02:52] marssh1: they had perma push
[6:02:53] kennyECS: @el_danixd it works with kalista and nilah as well but you need to play it right
[6:03:11] zetsu_tryhard: can also go sera apc if u get senna
[6:03:13] el_danixd: as someone who plays kalista i guarantee u its terrible with kal. works w nilah tho i agree
[6:03:17] zetsu_tryhard: i do that often and it goes rly well
[6:03:23] marssh1: how is senna good with varus
[6:03:28] marssh1: where is the synergy there
[6:03:43] zetsu_tryhard: root into garanteed W+Q from varus
[6:03:44] Tivez: Range
[6:03:49] el_danixd: @marssh1 cuz they both poke technically, but its pretty cope. senna pretty much only works with nilah or an apc like sera
[6:03:52] Megolaj: you can play quite a few champs with senna just usually adc's arent the best imo
[6:04:12] Nikushaa: i'd trade my support's life for stacks 10/10 times
[6:04:12] marssh1: @zetsu_tryhard i can see that but i feel like senna doesnt fit varus playstyle
[6:04:31] marssh1: varus wants to poke and push and harrass under tower
[6:04:32] zetsu_tryhard: idk considering varus ashe is rly strong im assuming senna fits the same playstyle
[6:04:33] inanexyz: lel u mad?
[6:04:37] Nikushaa: the devil shivers when the nice guy loses his cool
[6:04:44] confuzzled_z: bro tilts in german or?

[6:05:07] kennyECS: if only you picked up the cannon before dying
[6:05:18] marssh1: i could see varus ashe
[6:05:23] marssh1: but ashe is a lane bully
[6:05:25] mikelce_: how's draven this patch?
[6:05:48] zetsu_tryhard: yea i think senna being slower overall makes the lane not as aggro as the ashe one but idk not very experienced on the matchups
[6:06:08] marssh1: i get u
[6:06:22] marssh1: but if jack is saying ban it so ur team dont pick im assuming its not very good LOL
[6:06:35] Nikushaa: smolder without mana is so cancer man
[6:06:46] Nikushaa: just give his Q a small amount of mana refund on kill honestly
[6:06:47] sprinklezuwu: senna is only good into enchanters basically unless you're a god at adc already
[6:06:50] Mangejesus: senna is lane bully too and very opressive if played correctly
[6:06:56] zetsu_tryhard: senna players are hmmm what the kids call elo inflated
[6:06:58] ToneDoLOL: support brains and mechanichs are not
[6:07:07] lolmirai: senna is op not in support mains hands
[6:07:11] confuzzled_z: senna is strong it just makes ur support run it down hidden pasive
[6:07:23] marssh1: so for senna u should just farm and let em scale ? @Jackspektra
[6:07:34] kennyECS: well if you need a support, then have the jungler lock that in
[6:07:34] sprinklezuwu: wait so us adcs are supposed to be useful and not get one shot by enemy poppy with iceborn gauntlet NotLikeThis
[6:08:01] ercomthf: buff vayne
[6:08:04] zetsu_tryhard: just role swap to support and become rekkles playing senna every game in T1 academy
[6:08:05] sprinklezuwu: vayne lvl 6 moment
[6:08:17] zetsu_tryhard: forcing ur korean adc to play tahm every game
[6:08:21] sprinklezuwu: wake up babe new build just dropped 5 motes
[6:08:47] el_danixd: @zetsu_tryhard i mean theres a reason senna is permabanned vs him, hes rly good at her. unlike ur pig support in soloq
[6:09:05] pental1ft: i think smolder is not playeble if you dont see our matchup.. @Jackspektra
[6:09:13] confuzzled_z: not enough ppl talk abt the second part frfr
[6:09:17] Tivez: But when the Senna is smurfing it's so chill playing kench ngl. Easiest LP of my life
[6:09:27] TIBET1337: bro thats why i pay u for playing corki bot, i am just wanting to u being in good mental health, not this
[6:09:31] zetsu_tryhard: @Tivez does that ever happen
[6:09:49] violcncc: true man can do it all
[6:10:01] Megolaj: so should senna player queue as adc or support
[6:10:03] Nikushaa: that's why you learn nilah as your pocket pick
[6:10:05] zetsu_tryhard: is the senna smurfing on our team in the room with us?
[6:10:12] Nikushaa: goes so well with dogshit soloq supps
[6:10:15] kennyECS: ooooor lock in kalista/nilah and hostage your jg into locking in ivern
[6:10:19] Megolaj: because either way its hard to get a good duo with fasting senna
[6:10:50] Nikushaa: CLEANSE DISCIPLINE Clap
[6:10:51] theblasphemer666: that was crazy
[6:11:04] theblasphemer666: smolder pheromone trace or sth
