[3:54:54] MrFaby69: @Naayil is eclipse better 1st now?
[3:55:06] Komlin111: her damage is so consistent
[3:55:07] nonsencephilosophy: did you PEEPEES
[3:55:26] StrawberryBursts: @sk1maskm yes, but you can do something, most champs just get curbstomped without any chance at all
[3:55:34] sk1maskm: ok gg
[3:55:36] SerWitchKing: Fiora just outscales Aatrox though
[3:55:40] Aarguil: she is

[3:56:02] becauseimbatmann: the reason that u builded eclipse @Naayil
[3:56:03] Komlin111: fiora W not aatrox w
[3:56:08] kira_tz13: She never was tbh
[3:56:27] kira_tz13: She always is a sidelane statcheck
[3:56:30] sk1maskm: @StrawberryBursts sure, but still, fiora is not a good champ against vayne
[3:56:30] Komlin111: no punishment for using q without hitting someone
[3:56:31] Dewalmy: @Naayil have you meet more or less strimers or "pro" players this season while climbing/playing
[3:56:54] MrFaby69: @Naayil is eclipse better 1st?
[3:56:59] EXxnightingale: did you try hydra?
[3:57:06] toplane_emma: hes getting bounties
[3:57:09] sk1maskm: bro the hydra lifestal buff was too insane in my humble opinion
[3:57:09] itSukoun: He soloed u twice man give him a lil respect atleast
[3:57:16] Shutaisei_: this champ is easy to stomp in low elo they can’t nerf it
[3:57:47] Komlin111: 6 hp RIOT
[3:57:49] sk1maskm: 2 hp
[3:57:55] sk1maskm: litterally 2
[3:58:02] z3urnwi: how she hit that lethal tho?
[3:58:02] sk1maskm: @Komlin111 2, not 6
[3:58:16] Komlin111: Nerdge
[3:58:19] kira_tz13: What respect I swear all fiora players are inflated
[3:58:20] intingkarthus: 6 hp ICANT
[3:58:40] i_am_him_frfr: is it me or farming with eclipse dmg way better
[3:58:40] Aargul: how she has so much gold wtf
[3:58:55] sk1maskm: @kira_tz13 why doe?
