[4:19:26] bladetrinity16: but ty denu :D
[4:19:53] Kinkou_Order: stunt says senna gets it better stuntNoted
[4:20:17] denunciator: mainly because 30 armor is practically more useful than range and crit dmg on thresh
[4:20:22] Atanaxe: they just get whatever eachothers soul stacks gives them isnt it
