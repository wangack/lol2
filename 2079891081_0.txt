[3:04:25] kanekii224: trundieHappy
[3:04:25] TrundleTop1: terminus better for anti tank imo
[3:04:36] PickleSnot: extra tenacity to help with the atk speed slow he puts on you, though
[3:04:41] TrundleTop1: yea true
[3:05:29] PickleSnot: I agree terminus to better get through him, but yeah. the slow on your attack speed being reduced by just a little might help. no idea if in practice it'll work, just tossing an idea out there
[3:05:34] denzcy: i dont think the value of reduing the att spd slow will do much since malph E will be perma up

[3:12:45] swiblt: !nasus
[3:12:45] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
