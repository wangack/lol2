[2:18:22] piercing_dagger: @stlnbutter ☠️☠️
[2:18:22] naberguuys: Taa
[2:18:22] spookedboii: @Dantes I think dragons should be the opposite of turrets. Turrets are harder to solo take down early because of plates, but later as they lose plate they become vulnerable.   I believe first two dragons should be able to be solo/duod pretty easily. Then the remaining dragons should stay/be tankier and be a team objective.
[2:18:30] jhadiel_vargas1: congrats on masters
[2:18:37] Storm3r: EZ
[2:18:43] zhabiy_: @killitsh if you leave him alone in lane he will still take 4 plates
[2:18:46] johnmacttavish: solid run
[2:18:47] Aten369: @spookedboii yep
[2:18:48] KebabFPS: thoughts on smolder?
[2:18:48] EdgeFNR: @WWombo Taa
[2:18:53] mangomochee67: if we are generalizing toplaners most toplaners arent able to solo kill turrets in 40 seconds
[2:18:59] naberguuys: @KebabFPS dgrawgon
[2:19:05] mose343: @spookedboii yeah I agree
[2:19:12] cute_egirl456: @spookedboii i belieave turrets should be completely deleted from the game so by winning a lane you can easily get inhib and nexus
