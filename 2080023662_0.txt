[0:27:58] lukas0515: @Jackspektra Hi. How are you today? I like adc, but atm it very demotivating to play when everyting 1 shot you. I used to play jhin but I feel like I cannot carry with him. Any suggestions?
[0:28:55] ADCPurple: @lukas0515 get better
[0:29:23] ADCPurple: is that good advice?
[0:29:43] slimakxd: @ADCPurple YEP
[0:30:45] wildriftboi1: hi jack
[0:30:54] SingularFish: Hei hei :)
[0:30:58] Notawonder: @lukas0515 Hey! this season has a huge emphasis on better positioning. As jhin your playstyle has changed a little to where you are more R heavy than you used to be.
[0:31:22] QteSurface: @lukas0515 I think something that could help, is unless you are going pro there is 0 reason to really care about your rank. Just play whatever is fun for you and have fun.
[0:31:26] SingularFish: Interesting
