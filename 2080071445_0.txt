[1:16:23] Burgerbrater1702: he plays roaming bard top
[1:16:24] nooberxdp: its a french streamer playing roaming bard top
[1:16:32] Silfel: Like the name suggests, Bard player. Plays him top a lot
[1:16:43] Iamaf33d3r: Lionl9 has 1600 accounts banned
[1:16:46] Iamaf33d3r: is that real?
[1:16:51] Iamaf33d3r: that is disgusting
[1:17:25] Iamaf33d3r: You don't even want to win

[1:17:50] nooberxdp: whats your thoughts on riot putting a service that makes u able to buy lvl 30 from the shop? (compared to botted accs)
[1:17:54] enreves: Some people just wanna see the world burn
[1:17:56] Burgerbrater1702: he receives the accounts, no?
[1:18:19] Iamaf33d3r: I hate that riot makes it too hard to unlock champs
[1:18:37] Silfel: took the shutdown rexSly
[1:18:37] Iamaf33d3r: I have 2 accounts and 1 that is silver to play with friends
[1:18:40] nooberxdp: i mean its also the fact u need lvl 30 before u can play ranked
[1:18:43] xWHITE_FOXx: i have only one account
[1:19:25] enreves: I have 2. One for top and one for support

[1:23:00] nooberxdp: black cleaver should be decent too now?
[1:23:02] Jakmo: buying accounts is an actual problem and no one wants to play in ranked with someone who doesn't even know their champ

[1:35:06] Silfel: What is the idea behind Ez support? ü§î don't see what benefit it brings besides the global ult
[1:36:50] enreves: probably either an ad main or mid main autofilled
[1:36:53] dotherightthing7: wat was the last character in the challenge run??
[1:37:05] Silfel: debugNoted
[1:37:16] looknonumbers: ez can just never walk into boxes i guess?

[1:40:05] enreves: KEKWiggle
[1:40:11] Iamaf33d3r: do you play magic the gathering @Santorin
[1:40:12] Bazeloth: So is graves ult meant to be used from close range? Does it do more damage?
[1:40:34] Jakmo: @Bazeloth just significantly easier to hit and Jax had no CDs to punish melee graves
[1:41:16] som963: Graves strong after 11?
[1:42:36] Jakmo: that Shaco appearance explains that weird looking Jhin R
[1:42:48] Jakmo: hard to remember that little guy is in the game sometimes if it's supp
[1:43:25] Falcnation: youre telling me ez sup isnt meta Kappa
[1:43:36] som963: Greatest of a

[1:46:12] Iamaf33d3r: why do i have 100 socks with no pair
[1:46:14] som963: Ldr?
[1:47:11] Jamanna: is that the same ashe?

[1:48:11] Silfel: If the LPL has that as ADC, my condolences
[1:48:22] Iamaf33d3r: @Bazeloth i am slowly going through my socks and just wearing a pair and throwing it out
[1:48:29] waynekerrishere: can you stop swearing? I thought we were the biggest christian community on twitch
[1:48:40] Iamaf33d3r: i finally realized i can afford better socks than hanes 10 dollar for 30 pair socks xD
[1:49:47] Silfel: @Iamaf33d3r ok mr money bags
[1:49:50] Donawen: @waynekerrishere Swearing? In MY christian minecraft server?
[1:50:11] Kraysys: swearing on a sunday???
[1:50:20] Falcnation: swearing at all???
[1:50:36] Silfel: Swear jar PauseChamp
[1:50:36] thomasersejere: What country do you live in nowadays?
[1:50:48] Falcnation: what the fudge, no freaking way
[1:50:54] waynekerrishere: nah time to put money in the swear jar
[1:50:54] Kraysys: thats how they do it on kids shows
[1:51:21] Silfel: this is clearly a kids show
[1:51:31] Silfel: danKEK2
[1:51:56] waynekerrishere: talking smack about the top laner fudge wow
[1:52:10] thomasersejere: What role should you play if your bad at league? (other than support)
[1:52:23] abix: what are we playing today?
[1:52:31] Iamaf33d3r: Hey! i am not bad at league
[1:52:37] TimeWizardLuL: top
[1:53:12] TimeWizardLuL: or mid
[1:53:30] minho12342: nidalee game?
[1:53:33] jsdeathbox: I believe supp is one of the hardest rolls
[1:53:34] nooberxdp: xin game PauseChamp
[1:53:46] Kraysys: you either go 0/10 or 10/0 as top lane there is no inbetween
[1:53:52] nooberxdp: PagMan
[1:53:55] Silfel: @jsdeathbox if it's a good supp, you are right
[1:53:55] waynekerrishere: looks like a zilean jungle
[1:53:57] waynekerrishere: angle
[1:54:12] Iamaf33d3r: Every game is support gap prove me wrong
[1:54:38] ChronicallyBlazed: why are support players always called bad? when my adc is useless almost every game and I have to roam to get other lanes fed
[1:54:40] kongrazzca: lillia strong atm?
[1:54:50] nooberxdp: eclipse angle in this game for sure
[1:54:51] Silfel: Santorin is sure gonna disagree after last match Kappa
[1:54:56] Donawen: If only I was actually good at support D:
[1:55:19] thekbshow4: Hello as always Santorin! hope youre doing good
[1:55:25] Iamaf33d3r: A lot of support champions have low mechanics so its "bad"
[1:56:57] Kraysys: support is just jg with passive income
[1:57:28] thekbshow4: Sup is broken. It feels so easy when i play it. You know jungle role is bad when sup has far more impact than jng right now. Or sup just that op
[1:58:27] Silfel: Why does Lee ping mid for that HUH
[1:58:55] Iamaf33d3r: @thekbshow4 support is easy until you play vs a really good support
[1:59:39] louiecheese: hello jg king lil bro hello chat lil bros
[2:00:08] ChronicallyBlazed: supp is OP but they also have one, so you need to gap another OP
[2:00:35] louiecheese: adc should be changed so they can solo lane and support just roams with jg
[2:01:01] louiecheese: adc so weak rn
[2:01:59] Kraysys: i see you're getting the 0/10 top this game
[2:02:05] waynekerrishere: I do find it funny that every lane thinks every other lane is broken, watched a midlaner stream today who complained about junglers being broken watched a top laner that complained about adc's being broken and now supports being broken lol xD
[2:02:12] minho12342: how adis how fking aids playing league of fking legends
[2:02:13] Jakmo: adc doesn't need to be changed for that, just start doing it. supp has never been force-designed to follow ad
[2:03:11] louiecheese: true
[2:03:37] Jakmo: S8??? with jungle funnel basically was that
[2:03:37] getsometalentloser: its so dumb that support can do what jungle can but  zero consquences
[2:03:52] getsometalentloser: u show top side welp all ur bot camps are gone
[2:04:04] getsometalentloser: support nothing cause they get funneld a bunch of  gold
[2:04:45] Silfel: Maokai gonna carry this PauseChamp
[2:06:49] Silfel: To be fair, Lee is being a hypocrite. Pining other people while losing this badly
[2:06:54] Silfel: pinging*
[2:06:56] LiesAndTears: he was alrdy low bruv
[2:07:04] Oblivixn1999: lee PINGING YOUR FLASH is CRAZY
[2:10:57] louiecheese: yo how do you play music on stream I thought you get in trouble?
[2:10:59] Silfel: danS dun dun dun
[2:11:15] Jakmo: that feels bad to see from their perspective
[2:11:32] getsometalentloser: will we get some  volibear today
[2:11:35] getsometalentloser: ?
[2:12:39] hazygreys: whole squad showed up for that red
[2:12:45] Ultranage: GF with more viewers than you???
[2:12:54] thekbshow4: Hydra?
[2:12:58] waynekerrishere: get lee sin fed and you win
[2:13:47] Silfel: @waynekerrishere not with that lee
[2:13:59] Kraysys: KEKW
[2:14:14] Kraysys: your expections were still too high for that lee
[2:14:58] Îã§ÎÇòÎÇò3: Lee exactly showed us what he got
[2:15:07] Jakmo: who picked first, Lee or darius?
[2:15:53] Silfel: Lee was first pick I think
[2:15:55] Silfel: :)
[2:15:57] sidequest76: @Santorin  Don't be ableist, blind people can throw too!
[2:16:25] Jakmo: thanks, that makes more sense. he can be a jg main who plays lee top off-role but Darius is a horrible matchup Prayge
[2:16:51] Silfel: But in that case make yourself carryable PepeHands
[2:17:21] Jakmo: even in jg, Lee is a MC champ
[2:17:39] Iamaf33d3r: why are you copying lee's build
[2:17:41] Iamaf33d3r: copy cat
[2:17:53] MayhemMikeyy: @Santorin Isnt liandry rylais better on ser?
[2:18:55] Kraysys: so yeah...about your team's damage
[2:20:37] Kraysys: this lee sin is my goat
