[0:15:34] Justice_for_Maokai: 4th auto extra dmg
[0:15:40] Salamanda811: She played that  so poorly though.
[0:15:43] charmythelittle: hi @KayPea have you tried ahri with lich bane? it's super fun ^^
[0:15:53] Justice_for_Maokai: yeah its her passive
[0:16:06] Salamanda811: Hopefully your jg has a brain and comes back.
[0:16:07] Darkcyter: "I think I think I think.. I don't know" - KP 2024 kaypWHAT
[0:16:12] TooSmoll: yeah, I played against diana mid the other day and I was like 0ˇ/8 even tho I was hugging my turret... fun times :)
[0:16:26] HelloOctoberly: isn't it like a double auto attack on her 4th or something?

[0:20:09] TooSmoll: Im seriously considering to start playing jungle even tho I have no idea how to play in jungle, just so I can have a bit of peace in this game :D
[0:20:21] Justice_for_Maokai: well she technically only has 1 jump but when she hits her Q first, its no cd

[0:21:04] TooSmoll: @Casyo99 thats exactly my thinking :D just mute everyone and do camps
[0:21:09] wilbert_1995: Hi Kaypea good night PopNemo <3 Kappa

[0:21:19] sabiirox: @justice_for_maokai she can get up to 3 dashes lol
[0:21:33] Casyo99: @TooSmoll jungler just needs to do objectives and your team might win alone ...
[0:21:56] Salamanda811: Shield lol
[0:22:17] TooSmoll: @Casyo99 indeed! Okay, its decided, Imma be a jungle main now andullHauko
[0:22:25] Casyo99: wtffff
[0:22:26] str0nix123: XDDD
[0:22:29] Therageranger: have you settled in CPH ?:)

[0:22:57] Salamanda811: RIOT!!
[0:23:14] theLevya: its heartsteel lux time
[0:23:19] Casyo99: @TooSmoll I kinda am a jungler main and most of the games I do nothing but camps because my lanes are winning but your lanes are losing trust me you can't do anything and will be blamed for it ...
[0:23:26] poppipopipopipo: Ye your not to far away on items too !
[0:23:30] Nexarlol: that was your fAULT
[0:23:37] Nexarlol: fault*
[0:23:43] Casyo99: @TooSmoll if your lanes don't have prio you can't do like drake herald ...

[0:25:06] TooSmoll: @Casyo99 that is actually reassuring, because I am usually muting my teammates anyway, so I just can stick to objectives and camps not caring for hate from them. I also heard that there is something like a tutorial for junglers? Like what camps to do in what order?
[0:25:11] Casyo99: kha is so good :D I love it
[0:25:19] madalinO2: Saving two people from the ads break later :)))) i wont be here then
[0:25:48] Salamanda811: Nice they killed it bot lane. Your assassin is much bigger than theirs
[0:25:49] Casyo99: @TooSmoll yes once you're jungler there are like what camps to do in order but that doesn't help much
[0:25:55] MayaShieda: hyaaaaa
[0:26:00] timothysangster: Hello
[0:26:10] Casyo99: I miss the old kha mid lane jumping around and w mid air :/
[0:26:37] sabiirox: @doctor0616 it depends on the match up, but most ppl go stormsurge first item but i go lichbane first item into a stomsurge after then i got shadowflame, and if you’re snowballing go darkseal, and after lich, storm and shadowflame it depends on what the enemy team comp if they got assassins go zhonyas, if they got a tank go magic pen, you could also throw into a rocketbelt if u feel like it, but if you want to go for more burat dmg in the start go stormsurge first item and shadowflame second<3
[0:26:38] Casyo99: was so good
[0:26:47] TooSmoll: @Casyo99 oh... thats okay, hopefully I saw enough junglers in my games to have some idea what to do :D thank you tho!

[0:27:43] Casyo99: @TooSmoll the way I see it is, if your lanes don't have prio you're useless to do objectives but most people don't understand that
[0:28:07] TaoWB: Hi KayPea taowbSelam taowbRUN
[0:28:11] Darkcyter: @oleander98 WB

[0:36:38] TooSmoll: @Casyo99 oh, I see... its kinda interesting to see how different league players are changing their main lanes because they are not happy playing them... makes me sad tbh
[0:37:01] IAmScarlett__: @TooSmoll i swapped from support to jungle bc support isnt fun
[0:37:03] Darkcyter: @Limerencez kaypHello
[0:37:18] sabiirox: @doctor0616 oh and btw those builder are for mid, in jgl u usually build different and u go either phase rush or electrocute for runes depending bout match up and tp or ignite
[0:37:34] CynicalScrub: nah, they have no baron dmg left
[0:37:49] IAmScarlett__: whats with the full enchantress senna
[0:37:59] ericaborgest: @CynicalScrub hello sir

[0:39:54] frodoswaggins12: I’ve noticed you really don’t play the ap assassins, just like the mages more?
[0:40:17] roselylia: me building frozen heart on sera almost every game lol
[0:40:21] Widdyful: I miss crown of the shattered queen.
[0:40:40] zolensia: I miss Crown so much ngl
[0:40:41] Smoothcollie: Enchanters crying in the corner with 0 MR or Armor item that would suit them
[0:41:09] sovitiaisavampire: tbh with AI voice modules and with SO much of KP's voice out there anyone can create audio of KP saying anything
[0:41:12] CynicalScrub: crown was a bait item

[0:43:05] Tonbo33: helo there
[0:43:11] zolensia: I kinda dislike that they changed the Liandrys build, because you can't really build it on Lux anymorer (vs a tanky comp) Which sucks imo
[0:43:11] fakercallsmedaddy: i know you used to main him that’s why im asking, ive seen a lot pf people playing him jungle
[0:43:12] ObsceneSanity: looks like thats game

[0:47:35] atichii: hi
[0:47:41] jeffreye5: it’s so crazy the best item is the support one that does 4% max health damage every 4 seconds or whatever. zaz’zak’s
[0:48:05] LyonAoi06: i think is more usefull cryptobloom than void
[0:48:11] Darkcyter: @atichii kaypHello
[0:48:13] HelloOctoberly: having played mid mage then switched to adc I feel like I have so many options for items, even if they aren't ideal for me. mages and enchanters dont get that.
[0:48:13] Arisutra: afternoon!
[0:48:18] som963: I feel like if u have 3 ap and enemy picks morde u might was well just dodge
[0:48:21] roselylia: i also really like the mini crown support item has, it’s useful on champs like soraka

[0:49:39] zolensia: The ego of people in "higher" elo is insane, they will legit run it down if you would pick morgana support because they dislike playing with her

[0:50:40] The_KungFro: I've seen rookern on assassins and ADCs even when we only have 1 ap champ and then that champ just can't damage them
[0:50:45] Littlex04: @Darkcyter  kaypHello

[1:31:05] S17Master: The worst part is when the meltdown person is on the enemy team, winning doesn't even feel good because it was a legit 6v4.

[2:08:42] akasaka__sad: i already knew*
[2:08:51] ericaborgest: nice
[2:08:56] Niomah: Ori kind of entirely depends on team comp @kaypeayouaregoddess
[2:09:38] kaypeayouaregoddess: She can't do much against every other mid laner, she became so squishy and easy to kill
[2:09:48] Niomah: Ori plus a tanky gap closer is the best feeling. Put the ball on them, they jump in, ult
[2:10:09] ericaborgest: Pog
[2:10:10] Niomah: BYE FELICIA
[2:10:28] Niomah: ugh akali AND Zed?
[2:10:30] catastrofia: KP! <3
[2:10:31] kaypeayouaregoddess: Can't really do much in high emerald with her, she's so useless in my opinion
[2:10:50] lilCACTUSS9: No possible way to survive that situations so at least you made him use his shit @KayPea
[2:10:51] sparkman347: pantheon
[2:10:52] notclarkyyy: we need doom bots back

[2:10:58] catastrofia: I only play urf
[2:10:58] atichii: i get tired after few games.
[2:11:01] Niomah: I played one game as Lux. It was just...too chaotic for me, even though I did well.
[2:11:04] atichii: notclarkyyy was thinking the same
[2:11:14] mastahkillah_og: i kinda love it dont have to farm as much
[2:11:21] mythicaldaddys: i like to play champ i never play in urf
[2:11:22] kendren25: Love playing control mages on urf
[2:11:24] Niomah: I'm old. I have OCD. Chaos and I are not friends
[2:11:24] atichii: i think doom bot was def more fun and challenging
[2:11:25] tronofcool: i'd rather have nexus blitz
[2:11:27] notclarkyyy: and that one time assassin game mode
[2:11:36] catastrofia: is it urf day!?
[2:11:45] mastahkillah_og: would love to see you play it lol
[2:11:54] atichii: notclarkyyy the bloodmoon one? that was fun. project mode was fun too. man urf is boring now :d
[2:12:03] Niomah: All For One was fun-ish, unless everyone else picked a champ I am crap on
[2:12:18] gigachadgodsu: Hellaur Bestie!! Your iconic hair as always eats up all of the basement's wigs, it's def the moment! purrr
[2:12:57] mythicaldaddys: akalie has mercure right?
[2:13:07] notclarkyyy: @atichii didnt really play much around the time of project mode so kinda had little memories of it
[2:13:12] kendren25: she's greedy af
[2:13:14] sparkman347: akali is broken on tft to
[2:13:16] sparkman347: its ok
[2:13:19] sparkman347: xD
[2:13:31] atichii: notclarkyyy yea it was up for a short time only
[2:13:36] kaypeayouaregoddess: We need a Lux gameeee
[2:13:49] Niomah: I think Project was during my "I hate this toxic community" sabatical

[2:30:25] Aikha: How was your weekend with family Kelsie?
[2:30:26] KinKaray: @lilCACTUSS9 Here it's not raining yet, but has been raining the past few days. I think it will rain today too, and the weather is kinda nice. Not too hot, but could be colder! :D
[2:30:37] wolterbrm2021: ggwp
[2:30:40] Niomah: @dori_f Oh good. It's so beautiful.

[2:31:38] Arisutra: weekends be interesting
[2:31:39] ericaborgest: tsc tsc so toxic man
[2:31:47] dori_f: @Niomah The eruptions are like nothing you've ever seen either. If you get a chance I highly recommend seeing them. Pictures don't do them justice :)
[2:31:56] kendren25: I take no pleasure in winning the gamba, but I didn't trust your teammates from the start
[2:31:59] Niomah: Making a nice healthy fried rice for two dinners this week. Rice, egg, zucchini, baby portabella mushrooms, and asparagus
[2:32:13] ericaborgest: @Niomah PogTasty
[2:32:29] mastahkillah_og: rapid fire!
[2:33:06] Niomah: @dori_f I have been to Volcanos National Park on Big Island in Hawai'i but Kīlauea and Mauna Loa were just smoking at the time.
[2:33:08] wolterbrm2021: arams
[2:33:19] lilCACTUSS9: @KinKaray That's good, I guess. Sometimes I miss a little rain.
[2:33:22] wolterbrm2021: ):
[2:33:23] shedfirekid1: I have been on a massive loss streak and losing 32 and 30 LP each game. I have lost motivation when teams run it down and in 2 games I lose so much
[2:33:23] kendren25: TFT?
[2:33:25] KinKaray: TFT with Lucas???
[2:33:44] soulsinger27: I agree with that KP
[2:33:46] Niomah: I love playing ARAMs, don't really want to watch one
[2:33:49] Saffy1: i love playing arams, but i would not watch it
[2:34:00] Arisutra: never watched someone play arams, probably a reason for that aha
[2:34:03] kendren25: I like watching them as much as playing them, tbh
[2:34:09] Rinniera: I climbed from Silver 4 to Plat 3 this season relatively painlessly with nice teams, then once I hit Plat I noticed I started getting a lot of flamers, afkers and people giving up after one death...since then I've dropped from 52% WR to 48% WR and demoted to  Gold 2. Nice to see someone who can relate and understand the problem instead of saying "git gud lol"
[2:34:13] ToxXikSin: Gm KP! 😊
[2:34:25] KinKaray: @lilCACTUSS9 I would like if it was a little colder, than raining. Even tho I was born in a hotter country, I love the cold! :D
[2:34:44] Niomah: I only ARAM for the past few years but that's primarily because it's nearly impossible for me to carve out more than 40 minutes of freetime to play in one stretch
[2:34:54] lilCACTUSS9: @KayPea Are you happy Riot gave us victorious Tryndamare with 4 chromas? I'm gonna use the f*ck out of that skin, as a mage main, I can feel it. Kappa
[2:34:56] kendren25: I do *shrug*
[2:35:08] KinKaray: I only play Arams, and I would love to watch people playing! :D
[2:35:09] spellbinder1989: any KP content is good content
[2:35:25] wolterbrm2021: do you have a favourite lux skin?
[2:35:41] pink_boater: HahaCat
[2:35:52] juicy_jo: elementalist lux?
[2:35:57] KinKaray: @wolterbrm2021 McDonalds Lux, best skin! :D
[2:36:05] wolterbrm2021: XD
[2:36:10] wolterbrm2021: i like both cosmic skins
[2:36:15] Rinniera: Yeah I lost one game at P4 0lp and instantly demoted I was like okay lol
[2:36:22] Niomah: I love space groove lux
[2:36:27] Niomah: and porcelain
[2:36:37] Rinniera: I'm trying to learn new champions that can snowball and carry and 1v5 easier since I usually play a lot of mages mid that are team reliant

[2:37:10] KinKaray: Yesterday I've played a 4x4 Aram. We had 1 afk in each team. It was really a great and funny game! :D
[2:37:22] bonacci_versace: this is the emerald I’ve heard so much about
[2:37:25] Niomah: I'm trying new champs lately just trying to maybe gain the confidence to even play normals again
[2:37:28] shedfirekid1: I changed from top main to jungle so I could have more of an impact but when teammates refuse to move to objectives or run it down in lane what more can I do
[2:37:49] rivenchama: hii cutieee :3
[2:37:52] bonacci_versace: good to see you not delve too deep into the toxicity :)
[2:37:56] HelloOctoberly: even if your games get better your LP gains/losses wont let you climb
[2:37:56] Niomah: I haven't played a normal in probably 6 years

[2:38:13] Rinniera: Yeah it's so easy for challenger players to say you need to get better and learn to carry your team but that's not really realistic when you're in the same skill range and are trying to climb slowly, not smurf your way to Diamond
[2:38:25] Niomah: do eeeet
[2:38:28] kendren25: always heartsteel
[2:38:30] Darkcyter: @ivystars WB
[2:38:31] georgo__: I played like 400 matches this season and like 75% of the matches I could tell at loading screen who'll win because of the rank differences
[2:38:43] soulsinger27: Heartsteel lux feels so illegal but I love it haha
[2:38:52] Niomah: I suspect a lot of the high plat, emerald players bought their accounts

[2:39:58] jimbob_ywert: does Lucas help you like with teaching you fundamentals and stuff?
[2:40:07] Hymuno: become pro in a different game and force him to play him so show him how it feels Kappa
[2:40:14] hemofeeliac: doublelift is live coaching his gf through matches and shes in gold. he just kept saying "i can't believe that this is your experience playing this game"
[2:40:16] HelloOctoberly: 'play better' ... I had a maokai support who kept q'ing a leona onto me yesterday as a jinx...
[2:40:32] mouritchou: theyhave to deal alot with wintraders
[2:40:41] Niomah: Speaking of pros, is Sneaky still breaking brains with his insane cosplays?
[2:41:07] Rinniera: The ego that some players seem to have and the main character syndrome holds a lot of people back... I can be fed mid, my bot lane can be winning, but if my top gets ganked ONCE by the enemy jg the "jg diff, ff go next" spam starts and it's impossible to win from level 3
[2:41:31] yanjii: my boyfriend is grandmaster and everytime we try to duo he is like 'im sorry but i cant stand emerald elo, i just cant'
[2:41:34] AlejandroNaru: !elo

[2:42:10] teamyyyyyyyyy: thats how they sell their skins xD
[2:42:16] KXFLAY: Heyo!
[2:42:20] teamyyyyyyyyy: people want their skins on their new account too
[2:42:22] KinKaray: @KayPea Do ARAM games influence my MMR??
[2:42:26] Hymuno: happened to me in overwatch, hardstuck silver. Made a new acc and instant high plat.
[2:42:51] Niomah: I think they do @KinKaray to some degree? I show "silver" on my account but I've never played ranked
[2:43:06] infinityarty: my main is hard stuck bronze, my smurf is high plat KEKW
[2:43:07] KinKaray: @Niomah Thanks! :D
[2:43:10] Niomah: so I think there is an overall thing and a solo/duo Q thing
[2:43:36] KinKaray: I've been playing ARAMS in my main account, and I was wondering that! Thanks for the answers
[2:43:38] S17Master: @teamyyyyyyyyy Wouldn't be surprised if this is genuinely part of why they refuse to actually address how awful the climb feels
[2:43:40] Niomah: God Zoe is super annoying to play against in ARAM
[2:43:47] korbeenoxo: what could be a solution or idea?
[2:43:57] kendren25: I could see MMR being on maybe a 24 month rotations. Anything over 2 years old shouldn't affect your account
[2:44:25] BE_OH_WHY: clean kelsie
[2:44:27] Rinniera: Eyy nice first blood!
[2:44:32] BE_OH_WHY: nice firstblood
[2:44:37] Niomah: @kendren25 That would defeat the purpose of getting people to start new accounts and reselling skins to them
[2:44:51] kendren25: Oh God, you're right
[2:44:54] Niomah: which is basically what it's really about in a "free" game
[2:45:12] kendren25: SHEN
[2:45:14] ericaborgest: POGGERS
[2:45:16] bluesiies: INSANE shen ult holy shit
[2:45:16] S17Master: Clutch
[2:45:17] dinotuti: omg daddy shen
[2:45:22] jeffreye5: SHENETHAN!!!!!!
[2:45:22] allidoma: NICEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:45:22] mastahkillah_og: damn
[2:45:25] liamae3: i went to silver 97 lp to bronze 3, dont want to play anymore this game, riot wins
[2:45:26] Rinniera: Honestly I have a second account but I dont like playing on it cuz it has very few champs and I want to have all my skins but refuse to rebuy them on another acct
[2:45:28] Niomah: Shen getting honors this game
[2:45:31] demipngg: i love shen players
[2:45:42] Alex643VL: Zoe’s bills were clearly affected
[2:45:58] egkavla: <3 <3
[2:46:07] S17Master: Oh boy, Cait showing main char syndrome because Brand committed the crime of helping elsewhere on the map
[2:46:20] Rinniera: Ive been playing since Season 2 lol yeah my MMR is pretty cemented which sucks
[2:46:37] Hymuno: just make 160 accs, 1 for each champion to one trick, ez Kappa
[2:46:46] Rigg_Callahan: Hello sunshine
[2:46:49] kendren25: no
[2:46:50] bluesiies: if only you could gift skins you have to another account instead of rp
[2:46:51] kendren25: NO
[2:46:53] ericaborgest: the great ecape Pog
[2:46:57] ericaborgest: escape*
[2:46:58] Lhadge: If i honestly have to rank the experiences. First is winning the game with a friendly team, second losing with a friendly team, winning with a toxic team and last but like miles away is losing with a toxic team. Idk people get so mad
[2:47:02] Smoothcollie: Not  even close
[2:47:04] Niomah: @Hymuno you need x amount of champs to even play ARAM
[2:47:18] wolterbrm2021: @Niomah lol what
[2:47:22] kendren25: 30, I think, Niomah
[2:47:32] Niomah: 30 champs min
[2:47:32] Hymuno: you need 20 champs to play ranked
[2:47:34] zinther66: How old is League?
[2:47:44] Niomah: 10+ years @zinther66
[2:47:52] Hymuno: so like 8 accounts, its even easier :p
[2:48:01] korbeenoxo: you’d rather lose with good people than win w bad ??? Idk about that lol
[2:48:01] bluesiies: clean shmovement today miss p
[2:48:02] Eth747Official: kaypHello
[2:48:09] S17Master: @zinther66 Like 15 years?
[2:48:20] kendren25: 15 years this October
[2:48:34] mastahkillah_og: just imagine 15 msec lazer cool down
[2:48:45] could_eat: buying fresh accounts for mmr is cope
[2:48:58] could_eat: like people do this but it's irrational
[2:49:00] Smoothcollie: @korbeenoxo 10000 % better to lose with great people than winning with toxic shits. It's about the journey, not about the destination
[2:49:10] kendren25: I'll say this for Starcraft 2. When you start a match, both players exact MMR is displayed going in
[2:49:16] zinther66: Thanks - guaging my age by how old this game has been around!
[2:49:18] Rinniera: Lux is so oppressive when ahead lol I love it
[2:49:21] CrashiD_: This Zoe is
[2:49:22] ericaborgest: i can't get enough of this plays kaypPog kaypWOW
[2:49:24] kendren25: Why can't Riot do that?
[2:49:29] jimbob_ywert: as a Zoe main, that Zoe is playing really badly with her movement.
[2:49:30] Niomah: @korbeenoxo I would definitely rather lose with friendly people than win with toxic ones. It's a game, it's supposed to be fun. Toxic people make it very unfun.
[2:49:42] qnetrox: TR TR TR
[2:49:48] CrashiD_: @jimbob_ywert True
[2:50:17] bluesiies: @korbeenoxo winning usually doesn't = fun, i'd much rather lose with a nice team that tried than win with a bunch of shits that didn't deserve it
[2:50:21] Lhadge: I sometimes wonder if people are being at like gunpoint or something in the way the act when someone else makes a mistake, like their physical life is in danger
[2:51:15] Rinniera: Half the skill of climbing comes from stroking other peoples egos XD
[2:51:18] korbeenoxo: that makes sense. maybe I’m just different. I don’t think someone can be SO toxic that it would take a way from a winning feeling
[2:51:21] Niomah: the ones blaming everyone but themselves for their poor play drive me bonkers
[2:51:29] bonacci_versace: how are we doing this game so far
[2:51:52] could_eat: having to play therapist to your mentally ill teammates in chat
[2:51:58] S17Master: @korbeenoxo Those people are 200% out there. I pray you continue to never meet them
[2:52:05] Niomah: @korbeenoxo Last week, in an ARAM, I had someone make a comment so nasty in the champ select lobby I DODGED on the only game I had a chance to play that day
[2:52:06] bluesiies: @korbeenoxo thats a good thing my friend, a lot of us let the toxicity affect our game experience way too much
[2:52:07] Hymuno: and after you dragged your team to the win, you gain 20lp and lose 35 your next game :)
[2:52:18] kendren25: They're the same kind of people that save scum EVERY game they play. One little thing goes "wrong", quit and reload last save
[2:52:22] psyhew: some of my teams even want to ff when we're ahead and winning... like i have to beg them to keep them focused
[2:52:30] ericaborgest: noooooo
[2:52:33] jimbob_ywert: THIS ZOE IS UR FANN
[2:52:49] Niomah: I don't need a-holes in my pretendy-fun-times kthx
[2:52:56] m_rocka: oop
[2:53:00] mastahkillah_og: lol
[2:53:07] jimbob_ywert: This is proof and evidence of how KP treats her basement dwellers
[2:53:08] torge_154: is Lucas jgl Main? kaypComfy
[2:53:18] korbeenoxo: lolol to me at the end of the day it’s just words on a keyboard so that’s prob why the “toxic doesn’t get to me”
[2:53:21] bonacci_versace: I’ve been amazed by the player bases ability to focus on every single thing outside of their own gameplay. I’m an old man and just started playing league a month ago. all you can do is focus on your gameplay and communicate best you can
[2:53:26] torge_154: @jimbob_ywert yeah kaypShame
[2:53:30] korbeenoxo: also I do my fair share of talking shit
[2:53:32] ericaborgest: I had 3 games with ppl trying to ff at 10MIN LUL
[2:53:34] Jaguar542: Are you paypal-ling you viewers to int? cap LUL
[2:53:38] Niomah: @bonacci_versace I'm an old lady and I feel the same
[2:53:41] Toraxini: @KayPea I rather win with toxic people that play good that with friendly who ints, but that just me
[2:53:43] RavensWing: Hey KayPea and chat, sorry not been chatting as much but been lurking, life been busy you know
[2:53:45] jeffreye5: but they’re not carrying so they’re not personally  wining and therefore everyone should lose :)
[2:53:58] torge_154: Is Lucas maining jungle? kaypFlower
[2:53:59] Hymuno: i had someone ff because I stole their cannon minion, I was support and had a sup item stack KEKW
[2:54:20] Smoothcollie: It's also what u expect from the game, if u only focus on the LP gain, than ofc, any win is a win right. If this mindset doesn't ruin you, then good for you honestly. But personally having fun > satisfaction of win
[2:54:28] bluesiies: THERES A VEX?
[2:54:42] S17Master: @Toraxini Are you defining "inting" as "dying in general" or "dying on purpose"?
[2:54:47] bonacci_versace: I don’t feel good if I win and was carried. I only feel good if I know I played how I was supposed to or I helped support the win condition and didn’t throw the game by feeding
[2:55:00] som963: i feel like people dont wanted to get carried this season the main character syndrome is very strong this time around lol
[2:55:05] MaybMars: the last few games i've had with friends where we've won with a tilted team all we say now is "we won but at what cost" its a new running joke lol
[2:55:07] som963: *dont want
[2:55:22] MaybMars: it just doesnt feel very rewarding
[2:55:25] Niomah: @MaybMars Many Bothans died for this win
[2:55:26] Jazzoholic: @Toraxini inting is not very friendly now, is it?
[2:55:31] kendren25: @S17Master There are many who would argue there is no difference
[2:55:32] psyhew: i FINALLY fixed my mmr and then immediately went on a 7 game loss streak
[2:55:43] ericaborgest: yeh it makes sense
[2:55:47] Rahl123: actually makes a lot of sense
[2:55:54] BleachedK: is there a good discord servers for someone who is still learning to play a bit more competitively?
[2:56:02] nuyuzum: agreed %100
[2:56:04] som963: nowadays slash mute all is helping  a ton followed by slash deafen
[2:56:13] Kamii96: makes sense and totally agree
[2:56:18] torge_154: Is Lucas maining Jungle? kaypComfy
[2:56:21] Niomah: O I've had all chat turned off for....4 years?
[2:56:22] bluesiies: i couldn't imagine playing as much as you do every week, your therapist must be making bank
[2:56:24] Niomah: it's wonderful
[2:56:31] Arisutra: having nice people is sorta what you'd expect, it's not a "plus", if that's what you mean?
[2:56:38] S17Master: @kendren25 Sure, if their experience with the game is a binary based on the Victory screen or Defeat screen
[2:56:43] bonacci_versace: there is a league of legends discord as well as summonerschool on reddit
[2:56:58] Toraxini: @S17Master Ye kendren has a point but i mean like when you are out of your league and you dont die on purpose but you die bcs you are bad there isnt much of a difference if you trying and going 0/10 or you dieing on purpose and also going 0/10
[2:57:00] kriszidan: yeah there are people who are just so called energy vampires they just drain you mentally / emotionally
[2:57:20] Lhadge: It is sad that i'm making predictions in champ select on how many people i'm going to have to mute at one point or another during me game, is just sad xd
[2:57:28] som963: nice people is for casual games tbh league is very competitive so it attracts a different audience
[2:57:31] Niomah: @Toraxini That's not the dying player's fault though. That's Riot's crap matchmaking
[2:57:46] Yuemdu2: Hi betui stremer VoHiYo
[2:57:50] Niomah: And possibly a team not playing around a diff win condition
[2:57:56] Arisutra: @som963 but it's ironic that having a toxic mindset holds you back from being able to be properly competitive
[2:58:05] torge_154: Which role is Lucas maining? kaypPengu
[2:58:06] Smoothcollie: @toraxini define me what "being bad" means
[2:58:06] Toraxini: @Niomah Ofc there are games that lets say is just a bad game or you get camped or something but that doesnt happen consitently
[2:58:07] kendren25: That's what I was aying. Toxic people think there is no difference in being overmatched and dying intentionally. Every death is to troll them PERSONALLY
[2:58:12] Rahl123: but i think people don't need to be nice, just don't be toxic
[2:58:12] mastahkillah_og: What other games do you play?
[2:58:15] Chyiana6ft: when you do get that rare group that has synergy and everyone is kind <3
[2:58:22] ChiSkillz: Good morning.  Happy Sunday

[2:58:38] ericaborgest: LUL
[2:58:42] Niomah: @kendren25 I play only arams. I am silver MMR. I get thrown into matches with emerald and plat and golds all the time
[2:58:45] AutumnReds: you just killed a child
[2:58:47] Niomah: Like ALL the time
[2:58:48] kendren25: @KayPea Bully LUL
[2:58:53] jimbob_ywert: “IM SORRY!” *obliterates her*
[2:58:58] KiMekka: @AutumnReds KEKW
[2:59:01] som963: @Arisutra i feel like every popular competitive game has the same issue from league to ow people get mad very quivkly
[2:59:03] kendren25: So do I when I play ARAMS. And I get stomped lol
[2:59:09] mastahkillah_og: cool
[2:59:10] AutumnReds: Zoe had parents. they are now reverse orphans.
[2:59:18] DenYukinari: No mercy
[2:59:24] Jaguar542: Saying "I love You" while murdering a happy little Zoe in cold blood LUL
[2:59:31] som963: like u cant name me one competitive game where the community isnt toxic unfortunately
[2:59:31] jeffreye5: will you stream anymore dark and darker? it was so much fun watching you stream that
[2:59:32] charmythelittle: XDDDDDDD
[2:59:38] Niomah: I mean, there's not a lot I'm capable of doing against an emerald level 7 mastery ekko in aram
[2:59:40] RavensWing: Zoe is a 700 year old spirit not a child LUL
[3:00:03] braklovebeans: is 7 days to die cool? thinking about getting it
[3:00:05] jimbob_ywert: @ravenswing she’s even 1900 years old
[3:00:11] ericaborgest: PFFFFFFFF
[3:00:12] Hymuno: zoe could have used that D:
[3:00:12] mastahkillah_og: hahhaa
[3:00:16] ericaborgest: kaypHUH kaypHUH kaypHUH kaypHUH
[3:00:17] Jaguar542: @RavensWing we don't know, haven't seen her ID Card
[3:00:18] akasaka__sad: but with a mind of a child
[3:00:20] wolterbrm2021: uhm i saw a reddit where smn was dead convinced that experimental hexplate is good on samira kekl
[3:00:20] aside_sue: isnt stormsurge trash item
[3:00:24] Rahl123: and who told that in spirit years, 700 is not a child?
[3:00:30] BioTrecko: kaypSpy
[3:00:30] wolterbrm2021: @aside_sue no?
[3:00:34] Smoothcollie: @som963 ow is still a thing? :oo
[3:00:35] Yuemdu2: Why lux run fast
[3:00:38] aside_sue: oh okay, i thought it was not a thing
[3:00:41] nuyuzum: league is so toxic you feel like a toxic player when stomp the enemy xD
[3:01:00] ericaborgest: what's your ms?
[3:01:07] kendren25: @Niomah I agree. But then you get to toxic sweaty tryhards who just think your death is a personal insult to them
[3:01:14] Niomah: @aside_sue depends on how much damage you can do quick. Lux can do a LOT in one w or R
[3:01:22] mastahkillah_og: be =cause storm
[3:01:37] zarvell_: lux and cait is such a good duo

[3:03:27] som963: sadge
[3:03:28] kendren25: LoL has a toxic reputation for a good reason
[3:03:29] Toraxini: @Niomah Yes and no the matchmaking is for sure broken but the players in the "higer elo" should be able to play somewhat safe regardless of matchup you can always farm under turret if nothing else ofc when chall smurf is playing in gold vs a gold player there is not much to do i wouldnt call that bad
[3:03:36] Niomah: But my freetime atm is so limited, a sub 30 minute ARAM is easier
