[1:49:11] forg1vens04: titanic is an autoatack  reset even for ranged chaps no ?
[1:51:59] forg1vens04: chat what is the chance that if we all make a reddit post riot is gonna bring back mallet and gunblade oh yea and zz rot
[1:52:39] nef2100: Never
[1:52:49] nef2100: Mallet was to op
[1:52:54] Stuxnewt: why even put walls in this game? that champ can just go over/through them all
[1:53:14] GuyWilson: We would all have to riot heh.
[1:53:42] forg1vens04: it wanst that the item was problematic it was that when a champion was abusing it whitch was not oftet it became really anoying to play against
[1:53:46] 514484: riftmaker? PogBones
[1:53:51] forg1vens04: but gunblade did nothing wrong
[1:53:56] forg1vens04: zz rot i get it i guess
[1:54:45] nef2100: Why rift maker
[1:55:21] 514484: for the hp(scaling ap
[1:55:33] 514484: it's probably stil worse than liandorai
[1:55:41] 514484: but it doesn't matter at this point
[1:55:54] twitchsuckstoday: best item for tankmo to do a bit more damage
[1:56:41] twitchsuckstoday: all the stats are effiicient
[1:56:52] 514484: liandorai still does more i bet
[1:57:34] 514484: fun build for sure
[1:57:43] twitchsuckstoday: only if he can land shrooms..
[1:57:44] forg1vens04: @514484 ye riftmaker is better i think due to the cdr and the hlp scaling dmg and also gives omnivamp but except that its also more utility
[1:58:19] 514484: cdr ok
[1:58:40] 514484: but my point is the hp-scaling AP goes through teemo's shitty ratios
[1:58:41] twitchsuckstoday: 10*
[1:58:57] twitchsuckstoday: %
[1:59:08] 514484: regen is ok for a tank i guess
[1:59:23] 291x: @twitchsuckstoday it's 6% for ranged, no?

[2:20:03] 514484: and cdr
[2:20:23] 514484: and can use it to waveclear
