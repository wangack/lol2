[4:36:29] keenan_1v9: "going to be stuck under turrent" then proceeds to 1v9 .
[4:36:36] Wyatt_313: what's even the benefit of doing it this early
[4:36:50] noggo1: not having to trade against better early champs
[4:36:51] defaultname96: @Wyatt_313 free ghold

[4:37:15] Wyatt_313: @defaultname96  but its free gold for viper too
[4:37:31] astro___wolf: @matiautass so the wave pushes to him i think but idk
[4:37:32] the_chinino: your karthus is tilted off one death
[4:37:33] keenan_1v9: he will get cannon just watch

[4:37:45] noggo1: so you get shit on less
[4:37:51] noggo1: until you outscale
[4:38:00] EsKyAttic: @Wyatt_313 viper would get the gold anyway since riven wins this matchup early pretty easily
