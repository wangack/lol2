[0:49:21] Fr4gp4rty: Do you remember the pranksterera? With bombpranks and stuff?
[0:49:29] niightdancer: I wasn't allowed Internet till I was like 15 and do not understand most of what is being said right now lol
[0:49:41] cameron416: nah we were fucked the second the annoying orange came on the scene
[0:49:43] Gragnoth: Game theory, Matt pat is retiring... :(
[0:49:46] i_lowol_i: do tell
[0:49:55] balletbunny: FeelsOldMan
[0:49:59] mochakmg: Hank green :(

[0:50:34] Halofan642: all the youtubers and shit ur talking about are like 2-4 years older than me lmfao
[0:50:38] quicknade423: brofresco
[0:50:42] Anonymous0726: I was big into vanossgaming for a bit
[0:50:47] Nightbot: 5upL
[0:50:48] quicknade423: magikarpusedfly
[0:51:00] i_lowol_i: you're 24?
[0:51:05] Anonymous0726: First streamer I watched a lot of was probably seagull
[0:51:08] caitlin_fury: mine was disney channel, game theory and that wassabi channel YEP
[0:51:12] V9Jack: SivHD is good memories
[0:51:18] Gragnoth: @quicknade423 oh my god I loved his videos! XD
[0:51:39] balletbunny: 5up gives wasnt allowed to watch spongebob as a kid vibes
[0:51:41] imtehForest: u saying ur age made me feel old for some reason
[0:51:46] cameron416: honestly i just watched like jenna marbles, college humor, and then like rando viral shit 5upJorts
[0:52:02] imtehForest: ig my brain didn't register I've been in ur community for so long
[0:52:07] quicknade423: GMM
[0:52:10] divax0x0: Oh yeah Jenna marbles is immortal
[0:52:15] cameron416: she touched herself smh
[0:52:18] cameron416: wait
[0:52:18] i_lowol_i: i used to watch a lot of pewdiepie at web browser when app wasnt a thing yet
[0:52:22] Anonymous0726: I don't know if I've watched a single jenna marbles video
[0:52:28] Anonymous0726: Probably 2 ig
[0:52:33] Anonymous0726: give or take
[0:52:33] Tirmel: My childhood was Dan and Phil
[0:52:35] mochakmg: I watched a lot of like mcyt and reactions
[0:53:08] Evuszka: streamers are just a bunch of introverts lol
[0:53:10] superfreak123: sounds about right tbh
[0:53:25] i_lowol_i: my mind is lagging, i might get it later
[0:53:32] divax0x0: The dynamics between streamers remind me of high school which is why I will likely never be one
[0:53:55] balletbunny: YEP
[0:53:57] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[0:53:59] Whyin_: back
[0:54:05] Gragnoth: "some of the worst" is he talking about XQC?
[0:54:07] Gragnoth: lol
[0:54:20] Gragnoth: that's fair! XD
[0:54:26] divax0x0: There is good and bad but I don't have time for the childish shit that always happens
[0:54:52] cameron416: it reminds me of a real housewives show. sharing a space w ppl u know too much about & may not even like. but u can all affect the bag of one another
[0:55:31] imtehForest: it's good to chillax a little now and then
[0:55:41] Gragnoth: I mean I kinda like the 5up community as it is, but if it grew I'd stick around! :D
[0:55:52] Nightbot: 5upL
[0:55:53] i_lowol_i: ooohhhh, what's it like being famous?
[0:56:11] FrozenLavaReflector: Content creator is the word ypu are looking for
[0:56:12] imtehForest: LOOOOOOOOOOL
[0:56:15] TeaQLive: 5upLurk2
[0:56:19] imtehForest: that's so funny honestly
[0:56:34] imtehForest: oh it's like 1 in 2
[0:56:43] caitlin_fury: yeah influencer or content creator
[0:56:44] imtehForest: believe me, I do internship in schools
[0:56:44] Tirmel: I mean, it makes sense in a way, it is one of the careers that they wee
[0:56:47] superfreak123: yeah
[0:56:51] Atredeus: Just get really good at a niche game type... and get super lucky at an indie dev developing a game around it... and get super lucky that it blows up overnight? :D
[0:56:51] caitlin_fury: yep
[0:56:51] Dia187: i think it might be like every 1 in 1
[0:57:05] balletbunny: Waiting
[0:57:06] niightdancer: As bad as it sounds... I hope they don't succeed....
[0:57:07] Dia187: we’re gunna have no doctors in 30 years
[0:57:12] Dia187: lol
[0:57:14] Tirmel: There was a huge spike in kids who wanted to be astronauts when there was the moon landing -- it's just want they know
[0:57:23] superfreak123: I mean it would be great to do that but ... its unrealistic
[0:57:30] imtehForest: na some kids still have creative dreams but it's basically half that want to be a youtuber/streamer/tiktoker
[0:57:33] imtehForest: it's sad
[0:57:42] jesuzgl: It depends on age and where/who they're raised by. I am a Grade 2/3 teacher and between my two classes, I have about 2-3 kids that are SUPER into YouTube/Twitch, and a couple that are kind of into it, but otherwise they could care less.
[0:57:52] i_lowol_i: that's what i thought
[0:58:02] cameron416: oh no the kids can monologue trust
[0:58:08] Tirmel: There's at least 2
[0:58:08] divax0x0: You can tell which streamers had a job before streaming
[0:58:15] Atredeus: Oh, totally agree.  I don't think I could ever do it.  Didn't want to belittle, just think there's a ton of luck in blowing up
[0:58:15] imtehForest: u were off by about 100
[0:58:19] sharffffff: My dinosaur autism really wanted me to become paleothologist. I still kinda want it but am in uni for a different biology-related program
[0:58:34] jesuzgl: One of my students has his own twitch channel and he talks to 0 people. I watched his vod once, it's very interesting to see
[0:58:41] i_lowol_i: it's hard to think of what content to make
[0:59:18] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[0:59:20] Lau_340: and when your famous you have the chance to get cancelled over a hottake of sushi
[0:59:33] imtehForest: it's ineed wild, huge majority of people streaming here have 0-1 viewers, being in 5 viewers range is already a success
[0:59:35] imtehForest: kinda wild
[0:59:57] Atredeus: I think it's easier to chase the trends, but harder to get popular.  Easier to get popular creating the trend, but harder to always be ahead
[1:00:00] cameron416: the day i banned irl fortnite emotes was the day i stopped caring
[1:00:02] quicknade423: your voice is very nice
[1:00:10] Dia187: your voice is soothing as opposed to some screechers on twitch lol
[1:00:10] divax0x0: I will always say make the content you actually enjoy cause it shows
[1:00:29] imtehForest: happy to support that idea if you go with it but don't force urself if u don't think u'll enjoy it
[1:00:48] caitlin_fury: YEP or have gotten big through a viral server
[1:00:52] Anonymous0726: I know one person who really likes my voice and most people are indifferent as far as I can tell
[1:00:52] Nightbot: 5upL
[1:00:55] i_lowol_i: interesting 🤔
[1:01:00] Whyin_: streaming is tiring whyinSleep
[1:01:05] FrozenLavaReflector: I mean, at least for streaming, education video game content is more of explaining your thought process for your actions
[1:01:08] Dia187: yeah you really do have to stream to nobody for a while, it really tests your commitment
[1:01:13] Whyin_: I don't like talking so much
[1:01:41] cameron416: “streaming is hard” the twitter hoards r coming for u
[1:01:42] Anonymous0726: And one person who thinks I sound like you but his opinion is irrelevant
[1:01:44] i_lowol_i: which is harder, creating yt content or streaming?
[1:01:57] Atredeus: Seems like it's easy to let streaming take over your life.  How hard is it to maintain a work/life balance?
[1:01:57] CoyoteTina: Good afternoon 5up 5upWave
[1:01:57] Whyin_: I can yap but after a while I can no longer yap
[1:02:02] quicknade423: what is their team comp
[1:02:03] CoyoteTina: How is everyone today?
[1:02:11] cameron416: anon u simply do not
[1:02:18] Anonymous0726: I know
[1:02:34] quicknade423: their team comp is hella annoying
[1:02:53] CoyoteTina: I still hate my voice, but it's a different problem haha
[1:02:55] imtehForest: doesn't everyone hate their own voice tho?
[1:02:56] i_lowol_i: your voice is okay, 🤔
[1:02:57] divax0x0: If I'm talking about a book im reading or animals it's hard to get me to shut up anything else I probably won't talk for long
[1:03:03] Anonymous0726: I'm pretty indifferent about my voice
[1:03:22] Alpha_Sakura: not5upWiggle
[1:03:37] balletbunny: i feel like its nicer to be a youtuber because if you dont post on yt for 7 days its whatever but not streaming for 7 days is like where did they go
[1:03:58] quicknade423: or you could just have fire editors carry you lol. like tobias fate yt
[1:03:59] balletbunny: plus youre making income while youre not doing anything
[1:04:35] Evuszka: discoveribility on twitch is shit, you basicly need to funel in viewers from yt or tiktok
[1:04:51] imtehForest: yea u HAVE to be as consistent as possible
[1:05:03] i_lowol_i: makes sense 🤔
[1:05:15] sharffffff: I mean when you disappeared I just stopped watching twitch lol
[1:05:21] vsmilotic: i mean thats true
[1:05:26] divax0x0: @sharffffff that's what I did
[1:05:32] vsmilotic: i gotta find someone to watch
[1:05:34] Alpha_Sakura: 😭
[1:05:41] Nightbot: 5upL
[1:05:42] Alpha_Sakura: Into the rabbit hole
[1:05:43] quicknade423: 3rd favorite streamer
[1:05:48] balletbunny: unhealthy Sadge
[1:05:53] Januous: wait i just got here what are we talking about
[1:06:07] Alpha_Sakura: There’s literally only three streamers I consistently watch and your one of them
[1:06:10] vDaishar: -1 cannon
[1:06:10] Tirmel: @Januous Youtube and twitch meta
[1:06:12] Pyronorm: The cannon! D:
[1:06:17] Anonymous0726: !count cannon
[1:06:18] Fossabot: @Anonymous0726 Current value of 'cannon' counter is 12.
[1:06:18] balletbunny: CannonMiss
[1:06:25] Alpha_Sakura: @januous  hi Jan
[1:06:35] Anonymous0726: also hi jan
[1:06:39] Januous: hi chat
[1:06:44] CoyoteTina: It's nice to have friends that stream with you cause you build this community of the same viewers
[1:06:45] sharffffff: I literally only watch 5up on twitch, i don't really enjoy streams for the most part
[1:06:47] divax0x0: Will the lethal company vod become a video
[1:07:00] quicknade423: league youtube has changed so much since 2016 man
[1:07:04] Anonymous0726: Oh btw I found something funny the other day
[1:07:11] Tirmel: Maybe break it down into highlights?
[1:07:12] quicknade423: from the qtpie and dyrone days
[1:07:19] sharffffff: you are the only streamer i am able to watch consistently
[1:07:21] caitlin_fury: i put the league vids or the vod channel on as background noise while i work
[1:07:32] Anonymous0726: On your vods channel, you played phasmo about a year ago, and the title says "Bird" insteand of "Berd"
[1:07:32] divax0x0: You could post clips
[1:07:43] Alpha_Sakura: EUNNN
[1:07:48] keralisa: i also think that league videos are not doing well cause it’s an alt channel that not many people know about
[1:07:50] Alpha_Sakura: COME
[1:07:52] Alpha_Sakura: aw
[1:07:56] Januous: yeah but if we’re talking about favorite streamers im lookin at my number one right here
[1:07:58] Alpha_Sakura: I had hope he would manage
[1:08:02] pureiinsanity: wet noodle fight
[1:08:09] Anonymous0726: Needed to biscuit sooner maybe?
[1:08:26] V9Jack: The pain of having 1100 gold
[1:08:27] Anonymous0726: idk what yellow potion does yet still lol
[1:08:42] Alpha_Sakura: “NO RUNN” “Omg he’s actually pulling it off” “oh he was so close” the stages
[1:08:50] pureiinsanity: @5up you're not that easy to replace because we watch 4 your personality
[1:08:58] pennant5: Do you think if you would have mixed in more games like league at your peak, it would be doing better now?
[1:09:13] Alpha_Sakura: The streamers I watch it’s for the personality nodders
[1:09:26] i_lowol_i: same same
[1:09:44] divax0x0: There is a content creator I found that is a pole dancing archer
[1:09:44] Anonymous0726: rek'sai kinda going off
[1:10:14] sharffffff: i mean yeah, covid, among us booming, all that
[1:10:16] Slatterhouse2: peak covid and among us era?
[1:10:24] Alpha_Sakura: Oh I’ve seen that guy diva
[1:10:42] imtehForest: true, but even then, ur still doing amazing rn
[1:10:42] divax0x0: @alpha_sakura he makes me want to learn to do it
[1:10:50] i_lowol_i: what's the yt niche you were saying?
[1:10:53] Nightbot: 5upL
[1:10:53] Anonymous0726: I'm trying to think of the most niche thing I watch
[1:11:05] Anonymous0726: I guess probably just math yt
[1:11:17] Alpha_Sakura: It’s the looking at them and being “I could do that” like how delusional am I 😭
[1:11:18] sharffffff: most niche thing I watch is uno amalgam series
[1:11:38] CoyoteTina: Covid was a wild time, had to be at work cause I'm a technician, but not many ppl were coming in for service so we all sat around not making money and watching yt an twitch
[1:11:43] Alpha_Sakura: If you learn though that’s be cool
[1:11:46] divax0x0: @alpha_sakura I do not have the strength for that but I would like to
[1:11:48] i_lowol_i: @alpha_sakura feels🤣
[1:11:53] FrozenLavaReflector: Viewership was the topic
[1:11:54] Alpha_Sakura: Uh peak viewership 80k
[1:12:15] Alpha_Sakura: @divax0x0  pat pat
[1:12:32] Lau_340: theres more viewership now?
[1:12:58] KaReem103: what is this champ
[1:12:59] Fossabot: @keralisa, Your message was too long! [warning]
[1:13:03] Anonymous0726: Wait the answer is definitely just baseball played in a warehouse
[1:13:13] Anonymous0726: That is definitely the most niche thing I watch
[1:13:21] Pyronorm: Six grubs worth?
[1:13:27] Im_very_lostt: love your streams cause you’re one of the only ones i like that streams in the morning in my time zone
[1:13:35] keralisa: really i got a warning for that?
[1:13:37] Alpha_Sakura: Fossa :((
[1:13:49] divax0x0: Bad fossa 5upBonk
[1:13:50] Lau_340: fossa SMH
[1:13:57] Alpha_Sakura: Rip
[1:14:05] Tirmel: Fossa is very strict
[1:14:10] cameron416: karma tings
[1:14:15] Alpha_Sakura: RUN BOY
[1:14:18] Alpha_Sakura: RUNNN
[1:14:31] keralisa: fossa just hates me
[1:14:34] Alpha_Sakura: Oof
[1:14:39] cameron416: karma 70% hp btw
[1:14:57] vsmilotic: heal shield heal shield heal shield LUL
[1:14:58] Alpha_Sakura: league always has me being like “they can win this land being absolutely shocked at the turnovers like HELLO???
[1:14:59] Tirmel: @keralisa It's okay, Fossa hates 90% of chat
[1:15:04] Pyronorm: Karma is just BS, tbh
[1:15:07] Pyronorm: I lvoe her, but she is
[1:15:19] c7nder: jynxziGoodAim jynxziGoodAim jynxziGoodAim jynxziGoodAim
[1:15:31] Anonymous0726: I think this nami is bad
[1:15:52] Nightbot: 5upL
[1:16:24] sharffffff: i think they mean that alt having a name "5up vods" or "5up stuff" idk puts it much higher in search than "more 5up"
[1:16:48] sharffffff: so 5up needs to be the first word
[1:17:09] CoyoteTina: ^That makes sense
[1:17:10] sharffffff: for search algos
[1:17:18] keralisa: @sharffffff exactly
[1:17:20] popovxo: how far did u get in tekken
[1:17:26] Pyronorm: Karma gets constant RW to stay healthy. Her R cooldown just gets so low between Malignance and passive
[1:17:29] vsmilotic: she still decent karma is just strong right now
[1:17:29] Tirmel: ProZD put out a video awhile ago showing that that doesn't actually work, though. The search feature is just bad on Youtube
[1:17:35] vsmilotic: one of the best laning champ
[1:17:52] Enma_o: it feels like Karma just has better numbers than Ori
[1:18:15] Alpha_Sakura: Sometimes I search up a game channel name on YouTube and it just sends me to content creators of the game and I’m like NO I WANT THE CHANNEL
[1:18:24] SorayaSayo: more5up doesn’t even appear for me in search
[1:18:34] pureiinsanity: @5up you knew Karma, Senna and Soraka were enemy team before you picked ori
[1:18:49] Anonymous0726: got a kill finally
[1:18:57] notevyatar0: stream of game volum is too low
[1:18:58] Anonymous0726: yeah that was just not a good fight
[1:18:59] notevyatar0: or
[1:19:05] Pyronorm: Fed Senna fed Karma, it's looking rough
[1:19:27] Tirmel: @SorayaSayo Hmm, odd, it does for me on both accounts (one that follows him and one that doesn't)
[1:19:29] Anonymous0726: rek needs serp

[1:20:00] Januous: hmmm
[1:20:03] Danuole: 6up
[1:20:03] keralisa: 5up extra sounds good
[1:20:04] Tirmel: 5up +1
[1:20:09] Pyronorm: 6Up
[1:20:13] Anonymous0726: 5upp
[1:20:25] Tirmel: The problem with 6up or 5upp is that it wouldn't be tied to '5up' itself
[1:20:29] rkWeatherboi: 5upOOO_SQ
[1:20:31] divax0x0: 5uppps
[1:20:42] no_wak: 5up Plus
[1:20:45] CoyoteTina: 5up plus maybe
[1:20:45] Tirmel: There would need to be a space between the usual name and the extra bits
[1:20:47] Nightbot: 5upL
[1:20:57] Lau_340: more 5up is the 11th channel for me if you look up 5up

[1:21:46] Tirmel: @SorayaSayo Interesting...maybe I looked up something 5up related on the other account without remembering
[1:22:26] Pyronorm: RekSai salty af
[1:22:32] Tirmel: 5up Clips are under more 5up
[1:22:46] pureiinsanity: azir would be better than ori

[2:12:08] Halofan642: ya u definitely need dcap
[2:12:10] Halofan642: over some item
[2:12:10] 420paul69: :)
[2:12:31] Pyronorm: I think Stormsurge is very good when you can finish off someone you otherwise wouldn't, or you can pop the target and spread the damage to their whole team
[2:12:36] Halofan642: dcap works on everything shadowflame only works on under 35% which most often is ur r right
[2:12:47] geomyca: i just think stormsurge is so bad after nerfs but thats just me idk
[2:12:48] 420paul69: every day goes by i kinda start to dislike stormsurge a bit more
[2:13:16] 420paul69: when i look how much damage it does and the gold it gets me it feels like
[2:13:18] 420paul69: SO FAKE
[2:13:20] 420paul69: but yeah i get u
[2:13:29] 420paul69: im sure its completely anecdotal from my end
[2:13:38] geomyca: and maybe just the ap champs i play it feels bad on idk
[2:14:11] Halofan642: doesnt e slow pop banshees?

[2:14:31] Halofan642: oh thats sad
[2:14:31] geomyca: like im not sure how much its your team's fault
[2:15:03] Halofan642: they were like 50 deaths and 20 kills or something man
[2:15:05] Halofan642: what does that even mean
[2:15:22] BluerBlack: I think it depens on jungler, trading for kill is not that bad
[2:15:22] 420paul69: remember when lux had one of the highest base move speeds in the game

[2:16:07] geomyca: it was also just a really high kill game though, my entire team had like 8-9 deaths
[2:16:08] BluerBlack: is 18 deaths and like 40 assists also bad?
[2:16:14] Halofan642: @Pyronorm 👍 thx
[2:16:26] Halofan642: @BluerBlack thats an aram statline man
[2:16:40] geomyca: could just be a really long game :^)
[2:17:16] Hayase64: Was it the Senna game ?
[2:17:42] Pyronorm: @Halofan642 Generaly Banshee (and other spell shields) only block an application of a spell, not a continuous effect. Nasus E does a burst at the start which pops it, but the DoT of it doesn't.
[2:17:51] Pixelmaster113: il reinstall league and show you just how many deaths can happen GIGACHAD
[2:18:22] BluerBlack: @Halofan642 I think its more if its benefit to the team why not
[2:18:52] Halofan642: @Pyronorm ya i think i was just confusing lux e interaction with cheap shot
[2:18:56] Halofan642: cause cheap shot is bis on lux supp
[2:19:11] Halofan642: because of the slow always going before the damage, proccing the cheap shot every e

[2:22:41] Pyronorm: THey gave TF AD ratios on all his stuff
[2:22:51] Pyronorm: I don't know if they changed the ratios after that
[2:23:00] Halofan642: thgey added insane e  ad ratio
[2:23:15] Pyronorm: Looks like no
[2:23:16] pureiinsanity: i think the buffed base E
[2:23:20] Halofan642: its 70% bad
[2:23:44] Halofan642: they buffed base e as i think
[2:24:19] DangerZone14: Also crit ratio on W so RFC is better even on AP TF
[2:25:08] Tirmel: I thought you were broken a while ago
[2:25:10] BluerBlack: Its time for Graves game then? Kappa

[2:26:40] Pyronorm: Apparently it's standard, per ugg
[2:26:44] Pyronorm: Roa -> Lich
[2:26:55] FrozenLavaReflector: Roa is standard on AP TF
[2:27:14] Pyronorm: I guess giving a bit of survivability to use his new better sustain damage?
[2:27:17] Pyronorm: idk
[2:29:03] pureiinsanity: @Pyronorm better sustain damage in AP TF? wt
[2:29:14] pureiinsanity: AD does sustained dmg
[2:29:33] Pyronorm: @pureiinsanity They gave him extra attack speed, and esp if he goes RFC he'll still get some use of the AD ratios
[2:29:47] Pyronorm: IDK. Just trying to find an explanation for RoA
[2:30:28] Pixelmaster113: so correct me if im wrong. but the general goal is to be the first to reach "the other side doesnt get to play the game" level of strength? pepoThink
[2:30:52] Nightbot: 5upL
[2:31:17] pureiinsanity: @Pixelmaster113 that would be ideal but its not that easy
[2:31:17] Pyronorm: @Pixelmaster113 I wouldn't say it's THE goal, but...
[2:31:40] Pyronorm: There are some characters who try to scale to that
[2:31:50] Pixelmaster113: reimiNoted aye i assumed so
[2:32:14] Pixelmaster113: it does seem that you can snowball rather frequently
[2:32:18] Pyronorm: They still aren't literally "the enemy can't play" unless they're way far ahead
[2:33:01] pureiinsanity: @Pixelmaster113 in lower elo's it for sure is like that
[2:33:42] pureiinsanity: problem most games is people dont wanna try anymore and give up when its still possible

[2:51:53] apokuna: no but give me best season to watch i've been wanting to get into it
[2:52:05] Hayase64: I heard that in Korea since the majority of players are student and play in PC bang, they don't have a lot of time and so they just want to go next
[2:52:16] FrozenLavaReflector: 45 probably for the new era
[2:52:20] pureiinsanity: ^
[2:52:34] joppi__: survivor Gabon season 17
[2:52:42] FrozenLavaReflector: If overall, 28 is considered the best  season with all new players
[2:53:17] Its_Jujun: I love 31
[2:53:19] THEZIC0: Survivor Cagayan(28) is a must
[2:53:41] apokuna: 1 sec im ad breaked rq

[2:57:47] apokuna: playing it seriously is boring
[2:57:49] Komar95_: om
[2:58:01] apokuna: having a blast memeing on stuff is the best way to play it
[2:58:13] 9fierce9: PepeLaugh Streamer is malding

[3:08:38] keisevit: about 5 times? I can't count
[3:10:39] BluerBlack: A lot people stopped playing
[3:10:44] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:10:58] BluerBlack: and that happens to the ranking system when that happens
[3:12:15] Tirmel: Riot just wants you to do GTA RP
[3:12:22] BluerBlack: It might be some part that you were high rank once
[3:12:38] BluerBlack: so it gives you better score idk
[3:12:44] BluerBlack: probably
[3:12:54] FrozenLavaReflector: Why does every single aatrox build profane into tanks, I understand the item is good, but not into tanks, esspecially malphite who loves stacking armor
[3:13:10] FrozenLavaReflector: It does get partially reset in like 3monts
[3:13:15] BluerBlack: I dont think that mmr is the only match making parameter that matters
[3:14:24] bunsiezs: The lizard people decide who wins and who loses
[3:15:03] BluerBlack: Probably what rank did you have and general performance
[3:15:18] anv0y: malphite oom
[3:15:23] BluerBlack: Like I think if you play good you will get worse teammates to make it more even
[3:15:50] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:16:36] SorayaSayo: doesn’t the r in mmr stand for random?🤔
[3:17:14] pureiinsanity: @SorayaSayo Mach Making Rating
[3:17:27] pureiinsanity: match*
[3:17:28] pureiinsanity: jesus
[3:17:31] anv0y: rip collector didnt collect
[3:17:51] BluerBlack: Many Mean Randoms
[3:17:52] SorayaSayo: @pureiinsanity you sure? feels more like random…
[3:18:43] SorayaSayo: @bluerblack my thoughts exactly
[3:18:48] pureiinsanity: @SorayaSayo if you are referring to 5up's games they are consistently bad
[3:19:03] BluerBlack: I think the problem you have is their system is more stability based
[3:19:25] BluerBlack: so the longer you play its harder to loose and gain elo
[3:19:41] BluerBlack: We kinda wrecked your elo with paid games
[3:19:46] BluerBlack: and now its pain
[3:20:21] swirlberry: swirlberry subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Wowowow back again, how are the games going?
[3:20:31] SorayaSayo: @pureiinsanity as they are the only contact with lol I have… ya
[3:20:49] BluerBlack: But you were playing outside of your normal champs rotation right?
[3:20:52] jeskieKAT: Swirl LUBBERS
[3:20:54] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:21:00] BluerBlack: I think that also matters in their way calculating things
[3:21:14] swirlberry: Jes!! 5upFlower
[3:21:14] Fossabot: 5upFlower 5upFlower 5upFlower
[3:21:24] FrozenLavaReflector: Its a combo of the paid games, solo que renata and naafiri
[3:21:26] BluerBlack: Also Nida aparently is op now
[3:21:29] BluerBlack: KEKW
[3:21:50] BluerBlack: They buffed her heal
[3:21:54] BluerBlack: and that happened
[3:22:54] Flaress: its the MR growth not really the geal
[3:22:56] Flaress: heal
[3:23:10] FrozenLavaReflector: The thing about the paid games is that for every xin of gwen incidents, you need 5 games of paid champions won without loses
[3:23:18] FrozenLavaReflector: And thats hard to do
[3:23:18] Flaress: i spammed on my alt
[3:23:19] BluerBlack: I think we will see some emerald players soon
[3:23:50] pureiinsanity: jungle Zyra arc?
[3:23:50] BluerBlack: What you were usually playing to get high elo?
[3:23:56] FrozenLavaReflector: Is it time to resort to queing jungle?
[3:24:15] FrozenLavaReflector: Jungle is the best role to facilitate rn
[3:24:21] FrozenLavaReflector: Or support
[3:24:38] pureiinsanity: https://clips.twitch.tv/PoisedAuspiciousTrollAMPEnergy-xQXk5kvT7JE2k8hq
[3:24:42] FrozenLavaReflector: I actually think support has the best carry potential compared to jungle
[3:24:54] Flaress: what roles you playing @5up
[3:24:54] BluerBlack: ono last game ranks
[3:25:13] coinpe: coinpe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! 5upL
[3:25:15] pureiinsanity: remember this embracing clip?
[3:25:17] FrozenLavaReflector: Top lane is the best carry role, but low agency as always
[3:25:22] BluerBlack: jungle diff is hard I think
[3:25:46] Flaress: ooph
[3:25:53] BluerBlack: I think its jungle this season, it matters a lot
[3:25:54] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:26:26] Flaress: smolder senna good
[3:26:34] Flaress: tank azir mid
[3:26:37] FrozenLavaReflector: Jungle facilitates the best, but its much harder to carry this season on jungle compared to previous seasons
[3:27:06] BluerBlack: Yep its harder and if you are good the diff is huge
[3:27:06] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
