[0:41:08] Adrix973: that healing on the kaisa tho
[0:41:13] angrybirds5: That healing was brutal
[0:41:26] armaanxakx: So is eclipse better every time?
[0:41:36] cryosaan: how can i win against garen as aatrox?
[0:41:38] AnarchyJS: why build shojin, for haste?
[0:41:43] Saycool_DnE: Illaoi OMEGALUL
[0:41:45] chrono_ward: so we go shojin 3rd and then steraks/spirit 4th/
[0:41:50] chopsuey21: naut hooked you 3 times in that fight

[0:42:02] Zntroxx: atleast its not kaisa who got it
[0:42:05] stormseif: @cryosaan you lose after 2 items
[0:42:05] imgay1412: Ghost with movement speed
[0:42:10] imgay1412: Yeah
[0:42:31] giome2: Is eclipse good
[0:42:36] cryosaan: @stormseif ok thanks
[0:42:37] Saycool_DnE: @cryosaan is kinda hard, it requires you to be skilled while garen can play it dumb and win you, play with the range try to avoid going melee, and when he gets lvl 6 play safe
[0:42:54] rilexzbr: Eclipse underrated
[0:42:59] dimipertsi: does ravenous hydra work on aatrox the same way goredrinker did?
[0:43:09] stormseif: @cryosaan obv u win if u get fed but if you play even u lose after 2 items
[0:43:12] Saycool_DnE: nauti xd

[0:46:23] Saycool_DnE: @AnarchyJS you can change some items, maw is an option for example, you can do spirit fourth item if they have hard ap and you have healing/shields on your team
[0:46:24] enaye321: you just need to be patient and play with your spikes
[0:46:29] mostafaadel18: illaoi is weak vs any sort of range .. u got range on her u win .. so aatrox beat her
[0:46:30] Adrix973: yeah but the fact is that my aatrox is FeelsBadMan

[0:46:49] ChainZandShadowZ: sorrry naayil ill try to be as good as you so I dont lose the matchup (im iron 4)
[0:46:55] HyperStarjj: late game she misses E and still win
[0:46:56] sojabulle: I think its not that shes always strong, it just takes more time than regular to fully stat check her
[0:47:05] kronozapien: i am unable to use prime sub on this channel it shows on oother channels
[0:47:09] sojabulle: bc shes naturally very strong
[0:47:10] Kurac_rko: Do you think it's easier do play on euw or in eun server
[0:47:16] stormseif: @ChainZandShadowZ XDDDDDD
[0:47:17] Saycool_DnE: @Naayil is Stridebreaker any good if you are against high mobility champions?
[0:47:17] demonminer3: also depends on her tantacles
[0:47:17] AnarchyJS: @Saycool_DnE thank you for clarification. Im trying to learn aatrox. do you know why sometimes he starts dorans blade but sometimes he starts d shield?
[0:47:18] mostafaadel18: did u see what morde does to illaoi ?
[0:47:22] sbreed_1: is eclipse first better for snowball only or general havent tried it?
[0:47:31] rilexzbr: Try voltaic cyclosword
[0:47:32] Moh__6: NEW AATROX OR OLD
[0:47:36] armaanxakx: Shes safer from ganks also ig

[0:48:41] Saycool_DnE: @AnarchyJS ofc, is simple, depends on the match up, if you play against high poke you go dshield, and you also go dshield if your opp can be pretty bully in the early game. Dblade is good in any other type of match up
[0:48:49] gigachadbeliever07: oh no
