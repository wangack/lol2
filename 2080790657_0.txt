[0:08:12] Ryden7: Why are we eating Raccoons?
[0:08:39] rfarleydude97: Lets get it
[0:08:42] rfarleydude97: the spam worked
[0:10:16] MonteCristo: which game do you guys want to watch first?
[0:10:18] Clyde1500: I have been summoned RaccAttack
[0:10:21] MonteCristo: I wanted to do FLY vs C9
[0:10:26] Dicey_XD: fly c9
[0:10:31] Dicey_XD: or nrg
[0:10:33] kitkatbar5: Banger Monte PogBones
[0:10:36] rfarleydude97: FLY C9 first
[0:10:45] kinwicat: Banger sPog
[0:10:45] Clyde1500: I missed the end so I'd like to see fly vs c9
[0:10:50] rfarleydude97: then another LCS game into TL vs C9 if possible?
[0:10:58] Dicey_XD: NRG was the most entertaining game by far
[0:10:58] rfarleydude97: bc the way that game ended was KEKW
[0:11:08] MonteCristo: ok
[0:11:13] fistigons25: @clyde1500 you didn’t miss anything because that was a stomp from start to finish
[0:11:17] MonteCristo: We will figure out what you want after FLY vs C9
[0:11:24] Clyde1500: @fistigons25 I think I got confused with todays game.
[0:11:24] rfarleydude97: yessss sir
[0:11:36] stevethekind: this is too much pressure
[0:11:47] fistigons25: @clyde1500 ohh so you’re talking about TL vs C9?
[0:11:52] Clyde1500: @fistigons25 yeah
[0:12:20] MoonFall24: Btw monte are you already off the kdf train?
[0:12:32] fistigons25: @clyde1500 ahh, understandable. TL was just crazy bad in the end of that game
[0:12:40] MonteCristo: @MoonFall24 hell no
[0:12:47] MonteCristo: tthey nearly beat GenG in game 2
[0:12:56] Phaetox: cristoTRAIN

[0:13:36] Phaetox: Cuzz in his villain arc
[0:14:06] MoonFall24: Gotta watch the show later then
[0:14:14] kinwicat: finger bang bang
[0:14:25] nickis211: cristoLCS cristoRACCOON
[0:15:00] Phaetox: This will be the first LCS game I've seen this year
[0:15:16] stevethekind: anamatronic LMAO
[0:15:17] rfarleydude97: LMFAO
[0:15:22] Zebrios: Bwipo's gut-thrusting us all.
[0:15:24] 4blaze2that0: bwipo looks like my dad when he was 35
[0:15:25] Zebrios: I feel assaulted
[0:15:36] brandofan2: terminator trying to mimic human emotions
[0:15:56] stevethekind: cracked out of his mind
[0:16:10] 4blaze2that0: they copied fnaf
[0:16:18] Zebrios: TV station I think
[0:16:27] VehementPhoenix: Sorry LCS, after another year of underperformance with the exact same decisionmakers as before, you are sentenced to life in a broom closet without Brazilian viewership of BO3's. It's your own fault.
[0:16:40] rfarleydude97: KEKW
[0:16:42] Tarantismyo: That's true. Also, those scared the sht out of younger me
[0:16:48] rfarleydude97: banger comparison
[0:16:49] stevethekind: i will never unsee this
[0:16:51] arthradot: i am terrified
[0:17:04] Zebrios: Five Nights at Bwipo's
[0:17:14] rfarleydude97: someone pls make a sign of this for LCS when crowds can come back
[0:17:39] 4blaze2that0: inter is vibing

[0:18:21] hey_malaise: you not watching kt vs dk?
[0:19:01] Zebrios: I feel like any team giving up Senna right now is just asking to get slapped around.  It might fly in these games, but once you get international you're boned.
[0:19:49] rfarleydude97: Ooo thats the YT sound nice!
[0:20:02] MoonFall24: The usual response is ornn right? But then fly would lack dmg
[0:20:13] nuadore: nuadore subscribed with Prime. 
[0:20:15] rfarleydude97: Phreaks basement KEKW
[0:20:25] Mizzzraim: it's a cage match BatChest
[0:20:30] Giiino: anyone else find these loading screen interviews weird?
[0:20:36] Zebrios: I mean, they are in a closet, but honestly it feels a lot more personal having them in the smaller room and doing the trash talk segments has been hilarious.
[0:20:53] rfarleydude97: Jojo is just too reformed
[0:21:01] 4blaze2that0: inspired shit talked other 4 players
[0:21:05] rapiddax: prison bars?
[0:21:05] Phaetox: Woah they're so close
[0:21:07] Zebrios: Literal cages
[0:21:10] MoonFall24: They are in a gulag, deserved imo
[0:21:12] hey_malaise: reverse trash talking
[0:21:20] Phaetox: They hearing each other for sure
[0:21:56] rfarleydude97: that doesnt sound good at all
[0:21:58] rfarleydude97: lmao
[0:21:58] Calmwind: So this is what the LCS has come to.
[0:21:59] VehementPhoenix: It's actually INSANE stepping back and looking at what had become of this shitty ass league
[0:22:05] VehementPhoenix: has*
[0:22:14] archie7497: Unless you are bwipo and you would rather play in na cuz??m
[0:22:26] hey_malaise: valorant clears
[0:22:38] 4blaze2that0: it's ok, it's a one time thing, valorant tourneys will never overlap again surely
[0:22:39] Zebrios: The players all look miserable.
[0:22:51] Mizzzraim: but the viewership was up 4% not too long ago
[0:22:52] lexlaigh: lexlaigh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 3 already? cristoYEAHRIGHT
[0:22:53] Phaetox: Would hate that as a player. Are draft coaches in there during champ select? Imagine the draft coaches hearing everything each other say rip
[0:23:00] Cipherflare: LCS really have pro players in their skeleton closet LUL
[0:23:10] jerckysminion: jerckysminion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! can we get native american chanting as a sound effect for spiritual healing when KT destroys our dreams again
[0:23:13] sandboxxx: right, so compromises (like the closet) dont seem so bad from that perspective imo. its better than remote games right?
[0:23:16] rfarleydude97: KEKW
[0:23:18] MLG_Jake: I just arrived. What are your initial thoughts on the draft?
[0:23:21] Makkr: :(

[0:23:36] rfarleydude97: KT KEKW
[0:23:36] jerckysminion: yes but we need healing
[0:23:42] jerckysminion: KT always destroys our dreams monte
[0:23:50] jerckysminion: my mind cannot take 14 years of punishment !
[0:23:56] archie7497: @montecristo did you check lcs viewership this week in lcs? How was it without the lec host/caedrel
[0:23:58] hey_malaise: dk only win when they have tank azir
[0:24:15] naocorrijo: kt started 6-2 only to be 6-6 now, and looking like hot garbage smh
[0:24:16] 4blaze2that0: he's talking to the 2 casters rn
[0:24:30] naocorrijo: at this point i'd sub in the academy team, mid and bot lane are insane in academy rn
[0:24:36] 4blaze2that0: it looked pretty good tbh
[0:24:45] Phaetox: Engage without instadeath
[0:24:47] Zebrios: If your team has enough damage already, you just become an engage bot with wave clear.
[0:25:36] teeroytv: do players in the west have the brainpower to break out smoulder top like the eastern teams have been?
[0:25:46] madiiiman: Kappa are we watching DIG vs 100T?
[0:25:46] 4blaze2that0: fudge smolder top Aware
[0:25:49] madiiiman: plz say yes
[0:26:00] hey_malaise: why didn’t flyquest play volibear top isn’t that op in current patch
[0:26:01] brandofan2: they just dont have the toplane talent for carries
[0:26:06] super_oj: @MonteCristo im glad ur around, happy to hear from ya monte
[0:26:10] kingruben7: @MonteCristo are u sick?
[0:26:42] madiiiman: Monte was going to review KT vs DPlus but his doctor actually warned his heart may not survive the ordeal
[0:26:54] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman smart doctor honestly
[0:27:17] rfarleydude97: LMAO
[0:27:26] Krethas: Last year this time, we felt pretty gloomy about LCK against the strong LPL teams. LPL seems weaker this year, but I dunno if I feel any better about the comparison...
[0:27:31] Shadowless10: More brain damage for d+ than LCS???
[0:27:34] 4blaze2that0: c9 tl game last night might give u brain damage also
[0:27:49] sandboxxx: @4blaze2that0 +1, do not watch
[0:27:59] super_oj: @madiiiman does he have a normal schedule for streaming?
[0:28:15] madiiiman: @super_oj he streams 6 days a week when not sick usually
[0:28:16] Giiino: @4blaze2that0 every tl game gives me brain damage
[0:28:40] rfarleydude97: Azael?
[0:28:40] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:28:41] super_oj: @madiiiman oh i mean the times, if it normally begins around now and such
[0:28:43] Wisherex: Azir soldiers proccing grasp feels dirty
[0:28:48] rfarleydude97: LOL
[0:28:51] Zebrios: Azael doesn't watch LCK
[0:28:51] kraethan: The tanky azir only exists because they gave  the sand soldiers on hit right?
[0:28:51] madiiiman: @super_oj usuaally yes
[0:29:01] lexlaigh: spearsFacepalm
[0:29:06] 4blaze2that0: what's lck?
[0:29:07] super_oj: @madiiiman thank you good sir
[0:29:09] SaltineCracker94: YEP LUL
[0:29:09] Mizzzraim: he had 2 weeks off Kappa
[0:29:14] OnTheRhodeAgain: tbf hes been casting the TFT championship
[0:29:15] teeroytv: azael was too busy casting WoW last weekend
[0:29:22] madiiiman: Kappa
[0:29:25] DixMX: he was playing Baldur's Gate Kappa
[0:29:27] Shadowless10: If you told monte 3 years ago that damwon in an lck game would give more brain damage than c9 vs fly in lcs I think you would have told future you that you are a liar
[0:29:27] madiiiman: yeah 2 weeks off
[0:29:28] MarquisDeHueberez: too much tft casting
[0:29:29] lexlaigh: Ye... he was doing tft
[0:29:31] madiiiman: not 2 weeks on study
[0:29:33] lexlaigh: Tournament
[0:29:37] sandboxxx: he also casted wow
[0:29:42] spec_s: And WoW
[0:29:50] hazygreys: he works for riot, he couldn’t afford two weeks off doing nothing
[0:29:51] VehementPhoenix: Classic fucking LCS casting
[0:29:55] madiiiman: he didnt actually have 2 weeks off
[0:29:57] Mizzzraim: nah
[0:30:03] 4blaze2that0: u can even do it while u're casting the game
[0:30:12] madiiiman: i believe he cast 9 days worth of content
[0:30:15] brandofan2: its also never a good thing as a viewer to hear your casters say "idk why this pro is doing this"
[0:30:16] 4blaze2that0: football commentators do that
[0:30:21] lexlaigh: Lmao
[0:30:24] MarquisDeHueberez: azeal sees writing on the wall, lcs is his side gig now
[0:30:27] madiiiman: LOOKING
[0:30:29] Wisherex: Yeah, he had no clue this whole game, then today(Sun) made a comment about it offhandedly like "oh yeah of course Showmaker's been doing that"; reddit comments were roasting him a bit
[0:30:53] madiiiman: WOAH GUARDIAN RAKAN
[0:30:56] madiiiman: thats new
[0:30:58] DixMX: they don't know what to look for
[0:31:19] spec_s: Its your job to look at LCK, it's Azaels job to cast LCS
[0:31:20] VehementPhoenix: Fire everyone and hire Dom and LS to cast literally jfc
[0:31:24] archie7497: @montecristo you know something hilarious. Because LCS knew they would get no lec host they did item drops this week for lcs. No wonder their viewership was not absolutely dogshit
[0:31:27] Limpy7030: thats too much time for what riot pays their casters KEKW
[0:31:36] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I mean, if you're casting LCS, is your audience going to even know?  I doubt it.
[0:31:43] puki_stylee: That's so sad he don't even care about being prepared
[0:31:55] 4blaze2that0: I think kobe knew but didn't wanna call azael out
[0:32:00] 4blaze2that0: I remember him saying something about it later
[0:32:06] lexlaigh: sawaNod
[0:32:07] Zebrios: Kobe definitely knows.  He does watch LCK
[0:32:13] madiiiman: kobe does know
[0:32:28] brandofan2: just wait until jojo buys the cloth armor what azael says @MonteCristo
[0:32:29] najafan: I mean, Monte, if riot wanted them to do work while not on cast, maybe they should be salaried? :>
[0:32:32] Kaniskion: na casters as much paycheck thieves as the pros KEKHeim
[0:32:41] trespasur: C9 TOP 10
[0:32:48] archie7497: Kobe knows Kappa
[0:32:49] madiiiman: just checked. Azael cast 9 days of TFT and WOW during the lcs break
[0:32:55] Zebrios: The "I'm gonna hit the turret and not respect jungler" combo?
[0:33:08] super_oj: @najafan how does their pay work exactly? I always assumed they were on a yearly sal
[0:33:19] najafan: @super_oj Day rates.
[0:33:27] Zebrios: @super_oj Day rates
[0:33:40] najafan: I believe a few of them were on salary.
[0:33:40] MarquisDeHueberez: not excusing it, just giving context
[0:33:40] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:33:45] lexlaigh: Or do it mid game as well
[0:33:45] najafan: Not sure if any are currently.
[0:33:48] super_oj: @Zebrios @najafan I see... damn
[0:33:50] 4blaze2that0: watch jojo cs this game, he is chovying hard
[0:33:54] madiiiman: you really only have to check top 4 lck and top 6 lpl
[0:33:57] fatalqwerty: Just hopped in, what are we talking about lads?
[0:33:59] najafan: Like, Phreak was, iirc.
[0:34:01] madiiiman: the lower tier teams typically wont innovate
[0:34:07] Zebrios: @MonteCristo If they wanted the casters to actually care about doing a good job, they'd pay them enough to do a good job.
[0:34:13] Wisherex: i hadnt even watched any of the lck games, i knew about grasp azir bc i checked the reddit postmatch threads and saw people talking about
[0:34:14] VehementPhoenix: The LCS needs to just fire everyone involved
[0:34:28] madiiiman: Kappa also renekton nidalee, another damwon reference in this c9 comp
[0:34:30] najafan: I think Jatt was.
[0:34:53] Zebrios: But then you're exposed to the reddit public.
[0:35:07] Zebrios: and I'm not sure any amount of knowledge is worth that
[0:35:07] Shimmerz: but Monte he had to prepare all week for the best of 1s
[0:35:18] madiiiman: monte you dont need to watch the match, but you SHOULD watch caedrals video of the kt dk match because its fucking HILARIOUS
[0:35:18] Shimmerz: you only had to run a company it’s incomparable
[0:35:36] Zebrios: Azael is "Acting his wage"
[0:35:40] 4blaze2that0: world champ BASED
[0:35:56] najafan: If they wanted him to do work off stream, they should salary him.
[0:35:57] RealCheese2: @zebrios LOL
[0:35:57] madiiiman: also i cant believe guma stole keria's tahm kench pentakill KEKW
[0:36:00] najafan: Just saying.
[0:36:27] nuadore: I'm surprised their production doesn't/can't/won't put up recent stats for reference by the casters
[0:36:42] Zebrios: Busio played this pretty well
[0:36:53] Zebrios: His ashe arrows were on point
[0:37:32] 4blaze2that0: I'm p sure that's the only relevant arrow he's gonna hit this game LUL
[0:37:33] weak_mental_renekton: I don't think Flyquest drafted enough CC
[0:37:37] madiiiman: meh its the bad azir build
[0:37:43] madiiiman: nashors liandrys +++
[0:38:02] Zebrios: I think the build is fine for this game tbh
[0:38:09] Zebrios: He's got enough damage out of nidalee
[0:38:11] madiiiman: Kappa MrsChimChim?
[0:38:23] n_e_i_l: the definitely real tweet/chat
[0:38:25] 4blaze2that0: fight and win busio
[0:38:41] madiiiman: im not convinced he meant to fire that arrow

[0:38:45] rfarleydude97: im surprised that didnt hit LOL
[0:38:47] bbqftw_: maybe some online casino can prop up lcs when the money runs out
[0:38:48] madiiiman: i think he may hve meant to hit e
[0:38:54] Phaetox: Yeah that was never hitting
[0:38:56] n_e_i_l: even if it hits its a shit arrow
[0:38:57] Zebrios: Yeah I think that was a misclick
[0:39:03] Zebrios: Cause it was aimed at blue buff
[0:39:05] Shimmerz: pro
[0:39:06] frozenturdx: I hope he was aiming for senna lol
[0:39:08] madiiiman: that engle makes sense for e, it checks grubs
[0:39:12] Shimmerz: slick moves
[0:39:14] 1xhealth: this game was terrible
[0:39:17] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman yup
[0:39:33] Shimmerz: not even Paul atredies could see that arrow coming
[0:39:34] Shriez: Did they forget about how the soul drop rate works?
[0:39:43] Zebrios: If you're picking Senna to farm, you might as well pick a different ADC.
[0:39:43] 1xhealth: flyquest egoing varus ashe in lcs into c9 was so troll theyre not t1
[0:39:49] jpegexe: dont you want bloodsong on senna?
[0:40:04] n_e_i_l: huhi had a huge game on farming naut vs tl
[0:40:19] UpYerArs: westerns adcs start convulsing when they press tab and see their cs numbers as low as their iq
[0:40:56] 4blaze2that0: bvoy is the only one who played farming senna this week
[0:41:12] DrippingSweat0: used to stay up so late to watch you and doa cast, hope you're well
[0:41:14] najafan: It's so nice to see Nid back in the meta.
[0:41:19] madiiiman: Kappa thats why my trinityforce blade of the ruined king azir is op
[0:41:32] 龍王: its time to bring back Hatperson
[0:41:43] najafan: #FreeZirene
[0:41:53] madiiiman: that fudge flash was bad. if he has flash timer on bwipo he knows he cant die to q3
[0:42:09] UpYerArs: Someone like Upset will never play fasting Senna no matter how broken she is cause he gets dopamine rush from last hitting
[0:42:14] Wisherex: yeah that terrain flicker happened every single rift change yesterday and today, i have no idea why but it hurts the eyes
[0:42:16] kookoolau: but renekton is really a bad pick
[0:42:37] Exedra711: Exedra711 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! I knew my nose was smelling some good stuff cristoLCS cristoRACCOON
[0:42:50] 4blaze2that0: collecting kills every lane
[0:42:58] Mizzzraim: Inspired was so invisible this game
[0:43:06] madiiiman: why flash the azir ult when u can flash after
[0:43:11] kookoolau: flash was washed
[0:43:12] n_e_i_l: that azir bug is so annoying
[0:43:13] madiiiman: he DOES feel like flashing
[0:43:16] madiiiman: just... later
[0:43:39] Zebrios: Fly definitely looked off this game.
[0:43:54] 4blaze2that0: jojo beginning the chovying

[0:44:02] Exedra711: feel for you monte
[0:44:19] Zebrios: Inspired definitely phoned this one in.
[0:44:19] madiiiman: no chance grasp swings the lane this much tho. how hard hes winning wud mean normal azir also wins and it doesnt
[0:44:39] weak_mental_renekton: they haven't dived bot?
[0:44:46] 4blaze2that0: 19 yo vs 30 yo diff
[0:44:46] Zebrios: @madiiiman It actually does swing the lane a lot, because you don't get poked off the wave early
[0:45:00] madiiiman: @Zebrios yes, but not to this extent. karma shud still be ahead in cs
[0:45:02] themickbeingcarried: @MonteCristo why do pros in league have frequent gaffes when it comes to their item builds? n other games new content comes out and there will be dozens of videos on proper builds, etc., but with league it seems even the people paid to play just build by vibes.
[0:45:02] Shriez: I wish people would take Quinn into Renekton/Nidalee but with an Ashe support probably not a good idea
[0:45:16] najafan: Frozen heart is so busted on naut here
[0:45:51] madiiiman: ya 20 cs lead for grasp azir would lead you to think he goes even without grasp, but he doesnt
[0:45:53] Zebrios: @madiiiman Jensen thought he could take the level 2 trade because of his W + mantra Q combo, expecting he could poke Jojo off the wave.  Instead Jojo just stood and traded with him
[0:45:58] augustus860: what are your thoughts on how fudge has been performing this split. I feel like he really hasn’t been that great for a while now.
[0:46:14] madiiiman: also pro players are overly habitual
[0:46:18] weak_mental_renekton: example lethality over on hit varus this game
[0:46:23] Shimmerz: don’t mention that to LS
[0:46:23] madiiiman: they dont like to change builds in the moment a lot of the time
[0:46:33] Exedra711: theres a lot of factors to consider yeah
[0:46:34] najafan: LS agrees that building is hard.
[0:46:36] madiiiman: @weak_mental_renekton on hit varus is suicide this game
[0:46:38] Shimmerz: he would say that’s blasphemy and your sinning
[0:46:56] Zebrios: unless that item is stopwatch Kappa
[0:47:04] 4blaze2that0: remember deft buying ie with 40% crit
[0:47:07] 4blaze2that0: everyoen does it
[0:47:15] madiiiman: Kappa well monte i have a shopify rebellion game that disagrees with your premise of "as long as you have an item"
[0:47:17] sigmaballs2: this game is the furthest thing from a banger
[0:47:19] VehementPhoenix: Item building is very easy like, 50% of the time. Tricky 30% of the time. Devilishly difficult such that most people do it wrong 20% of the time.
[0:47:20] 1920_: @montecristo I waited for your stream dad. thank you for blessing me
[0:47:34] madiiiman: I hope we watch DIG vs SR after this
[0:47:36] madiiiman: its such a banger
[0:48:00] Zebrios: I think that Massu's thinking is that he's just gonna have to try to 1v1 the renekton and hope his team can dive the others.
[0:48:19] najafan: And frozen heart is, in general, insane in this game.
[0:48:22] madiiiman: if his plan was to 1v1 renekton hes not building lethality
[0:48:35] madiiiman: he has lethality to try and counterpoke nidlalee and azir. but enemy has senna heals
[0:48:40] madiiiman: its just a bad overall situation
[0:48:46] Zebrios: Only Zeus is allowed to play lethality Aatrox
[0:48:49] Kango42: should be banshees or deathcap second for nid also no dark seal is insane
[0:48:50] frozenturdx: cant they heal varus poke?
[0:48:58] madiiiman: why the fuck did bwipo cancel his recall
[0:48:58] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[0:49:03] madiiiman: i think he gets out
[0:49:18] madiiiman: its close but he has a chance
[0:49:18] 4blaze2that0: he did so much damage with only one damage item
[0:49:31] madiiiman: but hes dead for sure if he cancels it
[0:49:33] madiiiman: so may as well chance it
[0:49:34] Zebrios: Oh he def gets otu there
[0:49:35] AiliceAI: the ward died on its own
[0:49:45] ZOoM13996: nah azir had dash as well, he gets there
[0:49:57] mavis96: don't you see liandry proc? I think azir just hit him with the blind q, no?
[0:49:59] madiiiman: Kappa blue trinket wards dont typically die on their own
[0:50:14] mavis96: he didn't cancel, he got canceled i think?
[0:50:14] ZOoM13996: he just started his recall when azir came, so he doesnt get out
[0:50:14] Shimmerz: there was a grassy noll near that ward that an auto came from
[0:50:19] madiiiman: Kappa ive never known a ward to die on its own that isnt a yellow trinket
[0:50:22] AiliceAI: blue wards do die o  their own though if you go into rabge of them
[0:50:26] madiiiman: or pre season 5
[0:50:26] Shimmerz: no one knows who autoed it
[0:50:44] 1DeepBlue: Schroedingers auto
[0:50:48] Shriez: @AiliceAI thats the ghost poro, blue wards dont die till they get hit
[0:50:48] rfarleydude97: KKE
[0:50:50] madiiiman: Zapruter Ward
[0:50:51] rfarleydude97: KEK*
[0:51:06] ManBearPig2992: theres a new conspiracy doc on netflix
[0:51:06] Zebrios: Shot it with the magic swerving arrow
[0:51:26] Shimmerz: the shit arrow from earlier in the game came back around and got it
[0:51:26] AiliceAI: @shriez you havent played league in the last season im assuming?
[0:51:30] AiliceAI: its a new change
[0:51:35] madiiiman: DIG SR today unironically top 5 game of the year
[0:51:42] VehementPhoenix: the term grassy knoll has been ruined forever. what if i just want to have a casual garden party unrelated to the Bilderbergs
[0:51:43] bbqftw_: technical issues FeelsGoodMan
[0:51:45] madiiiman: get the popcorn
[0:51:49] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I think it looks non competitive because Inspired phoned it in.  I don't remember a single play he made.
[0:52:06] trespasur: inspired not on a carry is not it
[0:52:10] fatalqwerty: that spaghetti looks delish
[0:52:18] parkyr413: raccoon fest? @montecristo
[0:52:20] 4blaze2that0: jojo cs hack
[0:52:28] Shriez: @AiliceAI very little because of injuries, hard to play if you cant move your fingers
[0:52:46] trespasur: riot dosent make enough money already? gotta lay off people who make ur produc better
[0:52:46] najafan: Yeah, he built rookern :P
[0:52:57] foreverHomeless: nose beers and league of legends
[0:53:06] madiiiman: frozen heart azir this game is questionable imo
[0:53:17] madiiiman: u have one on naut and you can get semi tanky with other items
[0:53:32] najafan: Nah, I think it's a good call.
[0:53:36] madiiiman: wait am i blind or did he sell archangels for liandrys
[0:53:38] najafan: It's just so high value here.
[0:53:42] madiiiman: i swear to god he had archangles
[0:53:44] Zebrios: I think it's actually a good call into that team comp
[0:54:09] ZOoM13996: why is NA so bad at league? genuine question

[0:54:09] Zebrios: with frozen heart, who's gonna kill the Azir?  Nobody
[0:54:12] sigmaballs2: are u gonna watch c9 tl?
[0:54:17] madiiiman: my entire commentary on his build from like 12 min ago was based on him having archangels first item
[0:54:20] madiiiman: where the fuck did it go?
[0:54:24] trespasur: are we watching c9 vs tl?
[0:54:27] parkyr413: @montecristo thoughts on this studio setup from the LCS?
[0:54:31] najafan: He's had Liandries for a while
[0:54:33] 4blaze2that0: c9 tl is more of a banger than this tbh, even if not in the best way
[0:54:38] madiiiman: my brain must be broken
[0:54:45] mibnelius: Enjoyed the last couple rides with the horsemen as I've watched my own industry implode from the inside for similar reasons 🙃
[0:55:00] Zebrios: He forced his own flash tho, not great
[0:55:02] 4blaze2that0: mind controlled bwipo too
[0:55:06] lordmercurio: rozen will reduce damage but paasive needs to be close
[0:55:23] lordmercurio: i think ohter items would be more eficient
[0:55:37] ZOoM13996: Renekton is such a dog champ
[0:55:38] MattScoot2: LCS viewership was up this weekend compared to before break and even without caedrel co stream or lec today, who would have seen that coming
[0:55:42] 11evx11: At least we have the Huhi game on Naut before the Senna nerfs. What a lovely fiesta.
[0:56:05] trespasur: @MattScoot2 drops?
[0:56:12] madiiiman: madiiiman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! DIG vs Shopify waiting room
[0:56:21] Clyde1500: there were drops??
[0:56:22] MattScoot2: it was up today specifically without skin drops
[0:56:23] najafan: He works at twitter. :>
[0:56:27] mibnelius: I work at one of the big tech firms ResidentSleeper
[0:56:30] imainleesin: is this the first vod review?
[0:56:38] madiiiman: that game is a fucking banger
[0:56:45] ZOoM13996: LMAOO
[0:56:45] Martinmacleod1: favourite ever league series? @montecristo
[0:56:47] madiiiman: best lcs game of the split
[0:56:47] Zebrios: Honestly DIG vs Shopify was more entertaining than this game.
[0:56:51] trespasur: @MonteCristo are we watching c9 vs tl?
[0:56:53] 4blaze2that0: tomo masterclass
[0:56:59] Giiino: please watch tl nrg i need you to shit on the tl draft
[0:57:00] milano357: HUH
[0:57:06] fortant69: does azir have a frozen heart?
[0:57:12] najafan: @fortant69 Yep
[0:57:12] cooleo1208: Gayge
[0:57:18] madiiiman: dig sf is luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing but there are 3 luigis
[0:57:24] madiiiman: and a tomo
[0:57:40] UpYerArs: jojo getting backshots
[0:57:45] MattScoot2: tank azir very good in high damage comps where hes basically primary engage, not so good when people run it with multiple tanks
[0:57:52] imainleesin: so whats up with this whole LCK ddos thing?
[0:57:52] Exedra711: thanks yeah already did
[0:57:53] Shriez: Tank Azir is giving me some serious Tank Ekko and Tank Viktor vibes.  Which one would be the most gamebreaking though?
[0:57:56] milano357: i like smolder reviews
[0:58:02] madiiiman: @Shriez ekko
[0:58:05] madiiiman: always ekko
[0:58:05] ryguy1212: poor bwipo with that lethality build
[0:58:13] najafan: I miss tank Ekko and bruiser fizz
[0:58:17] Zebrios: @Shriez In prime?  Tank Ekko 100%
[0:58:18] ZOoM13996: Tank Viktor sucks
[0:58:20] najafan: Gimme them back
[0:58:25] madiiiman: tank yasuo was by far the worst offender. phantomdancer rework patch
[0:58:34] Zebrios: Tank Ekko legitimately broke the game before they nerfed him.
[0:58:50] Zebrios: Like straight up 1v5
[0:59:00] madiiiman: Kappa heres my hot take for the day. Duke in 2016 was a better top laner than marin
[0:59:02] madiiiman: i said what i said
[0:59:10] najafan: Is that a hot take?
[0:59:11] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:59:16] madiiiman: than marin had been in 2015*
[0:59:32] najafan: Okay, slightly hotter.
[0:59:33] Shriez: They're saving Flash for Worlds
[0:59:41] Zebrios: Inspired was completely invisible everywhere.
[0:59:52] Zebrios: PvE hero
[1:00:01] 4blaze2that0: c9 tl or dig sr
[1:00:06] sigmaballs2: c9 tl was more of a banger
[1:00:08] madiiiman: dig sr
[1:00:08] weak_mental_renekton: If you were going to weakside top so hard, wouldn't it be better to play a tank?
[1:00:10] madiiiman: was way more
[1:00:13] madiiiman: of a banger
[1:00:16] madiiiman: than c9 tl
[1:00:16] rfarleydude97: put up a poll
[1:00:22] Clyde1500: dig sr NotLikeThis
[1:00:24] VerbalHorse: Bwipo said in the interview today that they wanted to test playing through bot
[1:00:29] madiiiman: dig sr is a top 5 game of the year
[1:00:30] ZOoM13996: Jatt lmao
[1:00:40] madiiiman: in all regions
[1:00:47] 4blaze2that0: apa absolutely trolling in c9 tl is pretty funny though
[1:00:55] thebelkman: i know this is lcs right now but how insane has milkyway been in the LPL
[1:00:58] Zebrios: This reminds me a lot of the very first season of LCS
[1:01:07] rfarleydude97: DIG/SR
[1:01:09] sigmaballs2: c9 tl
[1:01:11] weak_mental_renekton: @thebelkman makes me want to learn kindred xD
[1:01:11] ZOoM13996: cam
[1:01:11] milano357: @thebelkman YEA hes the goat
[1:01:11] Zebrios: The C9/TL game was good
[1:01:12] 11evx11: The LCS day of Senna demonstrated the gap between Eastern and Western LOL - Elk was crazy
[1:01:20] rfarleydude97: then C9/TL after but you def need to see DIG/SR
[1:01:21] najafan: Why is Jatt still working LCS?
[1:01:24] ZOoM13996: can't wait to see C9 getting clapped internationally again this yearr
[1:01:24] sigmaballs2: C9 TL or DIG/SR
[1:01:25] 4blaze2that0: c9 tl
[1:01:30] Saucy____Boy: c9 tl
[1:01:31] FannyBabbs: Tl vs NRG is hilarious
[1:01:32] Zebrios: @najafan It's a paycheck
[1:01:38] madiiiman: chat, dig sr is objectively the bigger banger
[1:01:47] MLG_Jake: C9/TL was a weird one.

[1:09:23] madiiiman: cant wait to see the new voli power in action
[1:09:29] HASTERIOUS: is Volibear the new ryze where he's good in pro but trash in solo queue?
[1:09:47] najafan: @HASTERIOUS eqeqeqeqeqeqeqeqeq
[1:09:48] Mykah9: So now i just wait for the real pro players in LCk and LPL to see how really good he is?
[1:09:52] sigmaballs2: @HASTERIOUS voli is good in soloq just look at the stats
[1:10:37] Neramen: Neramen subscribed with Prime. 
[1:10:49] Zebrios: Volibear seems like a Peanut jungler
[1:10:54] madiiiman: NO HWEI Kappa
[1:10:59] kraethan: Can he bully ksante and aatrox is the real question
[1:11:10] madiiiman: Little Miss Muffet, Sat on her tuffet, eating her curds and Hwei
[1:11:29] Cipherflare: What make Smolder strong?
[1:11:34] dah777: ur being hwei too punny Madge
[1:11:41] madiiiman: Kappa no he has to penguin walk
[1:11:47] hlpark: Kobe is tapdancing
[1:11:48] Zebrios: But can Insanity play it as well as Faker plays Hwei?
[1:11:49] HASTERIOUS: I forget asking you this, but do you still think SSW is the best team ever?
[1:11:53] Thaiestro: Dafaq is this amateur hr with Kobe?
[1:11:54] majormayday: looks like he has to piss
[1:11:55] Clyde1500: this isn't phreak's basement?
[1:11:57] BigMightyena: the NA barge KEKW
[1:12:00] EmailmanLOL: the back room is on the bay to pay homage to TSM
[1:12:00] cuyah: lol
[1:12:07] Giiino: S1 worlds wasnt this scuffed
[1:12:08] ZOoM13996: NA so cringe lmao
[1:12:09] Lopseypop: What have a missed what is this stage for?
[1:12:12] Lamynator: When does the LCS get the Starlink sponsorship?
[1:12:13] Thaiestro: This is what NA has to offer?
[1:12:16] garry_leonard: it's a big skull and bones promotion
[1:12:18] najafan: tbf, it does kinda look like a barge.
[1:12:23] madiiiman: When Kobe was a lad he ate 4 dozen eggs every morning to help him get large. And now that he's grown he eats 5 dozen eggs so hes roughly the size of a... BAAAAAAARGE
[1:12:29] Wisherex: the chain link fence decorations really just. yikes
[1:12:41] najafan: Like, why the fence?
[1:12:48] Thaiestro: I miss the old Korean ogn skits that made the players more personable, particular fav the kakao food gank
[1:12:51] najafan: That's just trashy
[1:13:01] kraethan: For what they "had" to do, its kinda a cool setup
[1:13:06] themickbeingcarried: Why even have the break if they're just going to run the rest of the split in a closet?
[1:13:08] dah777: it supposed to be a 'cage match' LUL
[1:13:12] madiiiman: Kappa voli runs at enemy
[1:13:33] weak_mental_renekton: iceborn
[1:13:36] weak_mental_renekton: -> deadmans
[1:13:38] madiiiman: tiebreaker is whoever can beat Zayzel in an actual cage fight
[1:13:45] najafan: Also Taliyah can prevent what little "engage" they have.
[1:14:06] najafan: And they don't have enough poke/disengage to make that a coherent theme imo.
[1:14:14] Mykah9: @madiiiman lol I will toss a few coins in for that match

[1:14:57] Mahooosive: sorry I feel bad now
[1:15:00] AType: thought you were taking notes for yourself
[1:15:01] Lamynator: we were being polite :)
[1:15:05] rfarleydude97: he deserves a sub for that
[1:15:09] HpRking: im playing warframe, not actually wastching :(
[1:15:09] Exedra711: i was Listening
[1:15:12] sigmaballs2: just thought u were having fun with ur mouse
[1:15:13] dah777: we thought you were looking up stats on other monitor...
[1:15:24] kraethan: The mouse doesnt show when its not working
[1:15:25] najafan: If Voli was Nid, or Mao, or if Lucian was like Varus or Ashe or something.
[1:15:29] willy8373: did you watch c9 tl
[1:15:31] najafan: That's a more coherent theme imo.
[1:15:33] Zebrios: I thought your arm was just on the same boat as the LCS cast, Monte.
[1:15:36] najafan: @willy8373 Not yet
[1:15:37] Myshirtisoff: we were mesmerized by your beautiful voice
[1:15:48] madiiiman: ok chat get ready for the best game of the entire year thus far
[1:15:53] madiiiman: you are not ready
[1:16:01] Zebrios: It was certainly a game of all time
[1:16:25] Imaslapyou: Imaslapyou subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! cheers!
[1:16:35] madiiiman: Kappa monte like my grandma with the remote trying to fastforward commercials and ending up 6 min into the show
[1:16:38] roivas1: i think the dig players are paid in mike and ikes
[1:16:44] dah777: is this a cristoLCS cristoRACCOON game?
[1:16:45] Mahooosive: does drug testing occur in esports?
[1:16:45] madiiiman: they are chairs, but they are noble
[1:16:46] rfarleydude97: TROLLIS POG
[1:16:54] Mykah9: at is shop?wh
[1:16:55] Giiino: i didnt know they still made mike and ikes
[1:16:56] Exedra711: ive heard of noblechairs
[1:16:58] dah777: BatChest NO WAY!
[1:17:00] kraethan: Shopify and shopify
[1:17:05] ThatLatvianGuy: The GamerTech™ Body Thermal Management Suit allows a gamer to battle for hours on end without breaking a sweat. It responds to changes in the microclimate and ...
[1:17:07] Exedra711: never bought it though LUL
[1:17:08] Zebrios: Adderall testing should be a thing 100%
[1:17:13] mainanalyst: Drug testing happens in chess
[1:17:14] madiiiman: Kappa drug test esports? so everyone dings for meth because they are all on adderal
[1:17:16] kraethan: Those are both shopify logos
[1:17:19] sigmaballs2: @Zebrios useless they can just say they have adhd
[1:17:26] Clyde1500: spotify rebellion? I barely use spotify
[1:17:28] Nekemancer: I actually work in a drug testing lab and we had some organization (not sure which) reach out to us to build oral fluid panels for esports
[1:17:28] TiesAU: And which coaches should be drug tested after which drafts
[1:17:28] DesperateApe: Hey monte have you watched fpx vs wbg and nip
[1:17:37] HpRking: cant most gamers get away with addy since they get prescription
[1:17:41] 4blaze2that0: locodoco gave bjerg adderal LUL
[1:17:43] weak_mental_renekton: randomly suspend players for weed for multiple years to be like other sports
[1:17:45] Giiino: how rampant is ped use in the pro league scene do you think?
[1:17:49] dah777: NA Clap
[1:17:52] Zebrios: In CA, it's pretty easy to get Rx for literally anything
[1:18:00] najafan: It's a bit harder in CA actually.
[1:18:02] rapiddax: can confirm, did it over phone with my primary..
[1:18:03] Mahooosive: imagine faker on adderal
[1:18:03] madiiiman: @Giiino everyone is on adderal until proven otherwise
[1:18:04] garry_leonard: adderol is so powerful. It's the closest thing to a drug that gives you super powers i sware
[1:18:08] Exedra711: pretty sure everyone in esports is on adderall
[1:18:12] edenjtv: yea god forbid they smoke a lil bud lmao
[1:18:13] ThatLatvianGuy: weed testing means riot just wants to shut lcs down
[1:18:14] Lamynator: considering how many pros openly admit to taking it..  you might destroy the pro scene day of
[1:18:26] Lopseypop: @garry_leonard Have you seen what crack heads do!?!?!?!?
[1:18:32] najafan: But I'm sure a lot of the people in LCS are on it.
[1:18:36] fartnugget45: bvoy is good player but his build is trash
[1:18:43] untzno: @MonteCristo wrote my senior thesis about Adderall abuse and honestly it is mind-blowing that it is not a bigger discussion
[1:18:47] sigmaballs2: KEKW he knows
[1:18:49] hitmon_gg: LUL
[1:18:50] mainanalyst: What??
[1:18:51] madiiiman: ya not surprised that was the response
[1:18:52] rapiddax: LMAOOOO
[1:18:53] Lamynator: at least they're aware
[1:18:54] HASTERIOUS: lmao he assumed they were all on addy?
[1:18:59] 11evx11: Consummate professionals
[1:19:00] imainleesin: lmao
[1:19:10] Zebrios: @HASTERIOUS At that time?  That prob wasn't too far off.
[1:19:13] dah777: BatChest KIA!!
[1:19:15] weak_mental_renekton: it doesn't look like adderall gameplay...
[1:19:18] madiiiman: @HASTERIOUS riot probably supplying it Kappa
[1:19:19] imainleesin: Bwipo was super hopped up today
[1:19:30] madiiiman: how u think riot keeps lcs fundedd?
[1:19:30] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:19:32] madiiiman: Kappa
[1:19:33] UpYerArs: Its not a real sport anyway so who cares
[1:19:37] AType: is it true?  does half the league use it?
[1:19:41] leamfor: People like Bwipo, who has ADHD, absolutely need it LUL
[1:19:41] TiesAU: twitch chat won't pay five bucks to keep the league sustainable wtf makes Kia think they're going to buy an EV9 for tens of thousands
[1:19:52] madiiiman: @UpYerArs performance enhancers exist in a lot of mediums not just professional sports
[1:19:53] ThatLatvianGuy: imagine if lpl/lck were on adderall, every game would be a perfect win vs eu/na monkaS
[1:19:54] CardGamerLoR: Do you think players with legit prescriptions shouldn't be able to use on a match day?
[1:19:58] Mykah9: They aren't sponsered by adderall it appears, but they might have a heavy investment in their stocks as board members
[1:19:58] sigmaballs2: jensen and bwipo clearly on it
[1:19:59] marfsmarfs: I'd hazard a guess adhd predisposes people to being good in the field, but the people with it will avoid the adder all becuse of the hyperfocus
[1:20:05] weak_mental_renekton: CS lead every lane SR :)
[1:20:07] UpYerArs: @madiiiman kappapenis
[1:20:14] leamfor: imagine how much Bwipo would talk without Adderall LUL
[1:20:20] najafan: Yeah, that's the issue. Enough of the people in the league are neurodivergent that it's really tricky to regulate there.
[1:20:22] ThatLatvianGuy: UpYerArs Madge
[1:20:38] Exedra711: think liverpool players all having asthma for instance, there really needs to be better regulation across the board in general
[1:20:45] mainanalyst: Volibear is good now huh
[1:20:50] Exedra711: its just noone cares
[1:20:51] leamfor: @sigmaballs2 That's to be expected for Bwipo, who actually has ADHD
[1:20:56] garry_leonard: @Lopseypop They do a almost the same thing
[1:21:37] weak_mental_renekton: very few 1v1 voli loses, hows voli xin?
[1:21:51] ZOoM13996: scorch burrn
[1:21:57] madiiiman: that turret shot
[1:21:59] madiiiman: from lucian
[1:22:03] madiiiman: he ate 2
[1:22:09] Clyde1500: we've only just begun
[1:22:14] garry_leonard: what is the edgy looking character in mid?
[1:22:15] Talsifer: Something about hwei having such quick auto attacks bothers me. Mages should have slow as hell autos
[1:22:22] leamfor: I'll be back for 100 vs FLY, this game is ass. @MonteCristo
[1:22:33] najafan: @garry_leonard Hwei, Faker's favorite champion
[1:22:36] Exedra711: hes a sinner
[1:22:39] imainleesin: yeah exyu is greifing
[1:22:40] madiiiman: @Talsifer vel koz, azir there are quite a few with fast animations
[1:23:10] garry_leonard: @najafan oh the painter guy
[1:23:19] madiiiman: but thats sejuani
[1:23:21] madiiiman: not voli
[1:23:27] rogaine_saintvicious2: oh god this game
[1:23:40] kraethan: 5 smites behind
[1:23:49] Exedra711: voli should beeline to his blue
[1:23:53] kraethan: Or was monentarily
[1:23:55] imainleesin: yeah exyu just feels lost lol
[1:24:30] madiiiman: smolder stack count for a lot of this game is... well its sad

[1:24:54] fartnugget45: yeah thats the new jungle tech for ad junglers
[1:25:01] weak_mental_renekton: no flash seju, time to punish
[1:25:05] fartnugget45: dblade + crystal after your first clear and you have a billion hp
[1:25:18] weak_mental_renekton: yeah boots seems better into so many ranged
[1:25:25] weak_mental_renekton: probably wants mercs
[1:26:13] unknown87644: i gained some more respect for bvoy after this game
[1:26:20] weak_mental_renekton: matches seju since she'd guess he's on grubs and go for drake
[1:26:20] mainanalyst: Soloqueue Sejuani?
[1:27:31] weak_mental_renekton: agreed but he's solo frontline into that team
[1:27:51] Birbmang_: is unending despair fumblewinter too slow for competitive?
[1:27:52] mainanalyst: they wanted the plate there
[1:28:30] najafan: It would be better if he wasn't a frontline at all imo, like Nidalee.
[1:28:42] najafan: (Or Maokai, if you really, really want one.)
[1:29:25] Phaetox: Like Hecarim

[1:29:54] ThatLatvianGuy: would ghost instead of flash be overkill?
[1:30:02] madiiiman: you only have to outrun your teammate Kappa
[1:30:02] Lamynator: that reminds me, I need to watch cocaine bea
[1:30:19] Phaetox: Ghost voli is very nice especially with ghost reset on kill
[1:30:50] Phaetox: But mostly for teamfights which they don't want
[1:30:54] madiiiman: Ad adc and support run into the enemy volibear. The support buys t2 boots. "why buy boots?" asks the adc, "you cant outrun voli" "oh i dont need to outrun voli" says the support "i just ned to outrun you"
[1:30:55] Amaresu_: games from last night (eu here) were pretty bad in LCS unlike previous weeks for the most part
[1:30:59] najafan: Smolder just hit 50
[1:31:17] Amaresu_: @madiiiman nice
[1:31:31] Amaresu_: thats a good redbull ad
[1:31:51] mainanalyst: how is that balanced?
[1:32:29] Dreammajesty: What do you build into a volibear with a nami getting Shurelya's as second item?
[1:32:34] weak_mental_renekton: really good soul
[1:32:49] Clyde1500: it's very good RaccAttack food
[1:32:54] madiiiman: it goes from 0 to 100 and never slows down again
[1:33:10] VerbalHorse: tomo ints repeatedly and without remorse
[1:33:22] madiiiman: no spoilers chat
[1:33:30] weak_mental_renekton: if people are hyping this game and ists 0 0 at 14, its about to get crazy
[1:33:31] FannyBabbs: I'm kinda sad we didn't choose Huhi's Big Day Out
[1:33:46] madiiiman: luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing this game. thats why its amazing
[1:33:47] Lopseypop: this better have 60 kills and end at 25
[1:33:52] Giiino: @FannyBabbs worth a watch just for the absurdity of it
[1:34:06] madiiiman: @Lopseypop add 22 min and youll get close with kills
[1:34:50] mainanalyst: so a slow burner?
[1:34:50] Dreammajesty: Look at that Voli shield, gotta melt it first
[1:34:50] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[1:34:53] ohsomagical_: Monte do u think c9 looked bad today ?
[1:34:55] Lopseypop: @madiiiman Holy glad i have this info after the fact if i was watching this live i would have fell asleep so quick
[1:35:10] madiiiman: btw this is the best western lucian you will see that isnt an import
[1:35:22] weak_mental_renekton: favourite smolder builds?
[1:35:31] FannyBabbs: isnt bvoy an import lol
[1:35:37] madiiiman: oh
[1:35:39] madiiiman: maybe he is
[1:35:45] mainanalyst: Dig has items
[1:35:47] madiiiman: not named berserker there
[1:36:01] ohsomagical_: literally korean LUL
[1:36:04] unknown87644: bvoy plays pretty aggro this game
[1:36:06] madiiiman: ok nevermind its eastern lucian, explains a lot
[1:36:10] najafan: 104 for smolder
[1:36:11] Amaresu_: i was sad bvoy lucian lost. he was playing well. his team was useless.
[1:36:17] hyptnoticgt: t1 vs geng is this week cant wait
[1:36:23] Amaresu_: insanity threw the game
[1:36:24] lol_alchemie: are u watching lckcl today?
[1:36:25] madiiiman: no spoilers chat
[1:36:34] 4blaze2that0: really u gonna blame insanity for this one
[1:36:35] Amaresu_: oh mb
[1:36:35] madiiiman: HERE WE O
[1:36:37] 4blaze2that0: fakegod literally hard inted
[1:36:48] Amaresu_: i thought people knew the result.mb.
[1:36:50] madiiiman: AND SO IT BEGINS
[1:37:23] Mykah9: What is up with wildturtle? why isn't he able to stay as a starting player ever?
[1:37:39] ohsomagical_: @Mykah9 because there's better players...
[1:37:44] weak_mental_renekton: lucain could atook the herald out lol
[1:37:44] Amaresu_: teams just dont want older players.
[1:37:46] madiiiman: @Mykah9 cuz it was his fault Kappa like regi said
[1:37:47] Shmalecc: hi monte! sorry this isn’t game related but I was curious on how long it took you to learn Korean and how fluent are you? I’m going to Japan in October and I’m trying my best to learn as much as I can so I can converse well. I know they are different countries but I was curious on what types of challenges you ran into when you first went to Korea?
[1:37:47] dah777: hwei too close Keepo
[1:38:14] mainanalyst: im surprised that CodySun isnt on a team
[1:38:59] madiiiman: Kappa he wants to learn korean for Japan?
[1:39:12] hitmon_gg: kanji monkaS
[1:39:30] Lopseypop: Romaji monkaS
[1:39:34] Vobakon: finally got some into the AM to support you guys
[1:39:38] junpei2012: For me Korean is harder to learn than Japanese
[1:39:47] Lopseypop: Hirigana monkaS
[1:39:54] madiiiman: Kappa why would america have a base in japan? when did we ever get in conflict?

[1:41:28] TiesAU: @mainanalyst good to know
[1:41:34] najafan: Smolder is ~140
[1:41:35] Thaiestro: The blue eye samurai I need to reserve time for considering episode 1 was over an hr long
[1:41:44] Thaiestro: Shogun I haven't started yet
[1:41:46] weak_mental_renekton: around 12-14 shirts nb
[1:42:09] del1nquency: Shogun blew me away, best show I've seen in years

[1:42:31] madiiiman: lucian trolled so hard
[1:42:33] rfarleydude97: This man just walked into the ult AOE LMFAO
[1:42:34] FannyBabbs: wait forget what we said bvoy
[1:42:35] madiiiman: he walks into the aoe
[1:42:36] 4blaze2that0: look how lucian died LUL
[1:42:45] Clyde1500: those astronaut tshirts slap...
[1:42:48] madiiiman: monte look at lucian
[1:42:51] kraethan: Bvoy........
[1:42:57] Ritashi2: lucian death was bad lmao
[1:42:58] rfarleydude97: Bvoy that was sadge
[1:42:58] TiesAU: WAit, Dig jungler launched the ult into narnia but then Bvoy walked back into the explosion?!
[1:43:03] suav0115: is this zeyzals first win in a storage closet?
[1:43:05] Amaresu_: yeah he walked into the sej aoe from the missed aoe but the part before that he played well
[1:43:14] madiiiman: LUL
[1:43:16] jpegexe: lmaooo
[1:43:18] madiiiman: Jebasted
[1:43:18] rfarleydude97: LUL
[1:43:28] mainanalyst: oh no
[1:43:34] Clyde1500: xmithie's dream
[1:43:35] goldensleetix: any thoughts on the idea that buffs/nerfs arent as impactful as everyone thinks since most kills in LOL are over done by hundreds of HP anyways?
[1:43:37] Amaresu_: yeah
[1:43:39] FannyBabbs: it was 90% a perfect fight for him too
[1:43:41] jpegexe: yea he probably is lokoing at the fight
[1:43:44] FannyBabbs: and then he derps
[1:43:44] Tolchy: Deja vu, i remember a certain clip of you reacting to another lucian inting LUL
[1:43:50] TiesAU: it's hard to see it because it's halfway to the Haunting Abyss
[1:43:51] Amaresu_: mhm
[1:43:53] Komarimasita: so my midterm was supposed to open at midnight tonight, stayed up and it wasnt even posted so here i am to raccoon this shit
[1:44:00] Mercaptoethanol: @MonteCristo Wasn't your stream watching MSI a few years ago the origin of the term 'boosted animal'? Someone donated $1 for you to look at l ucian suicide.
[1:44:30] 4blaze2that0: boosted animal is just soloq stuff
[1:44:36] UpYerArs: Has the LCK CL games been DDOSd or is it just the main league and streamers?
[1:44:52] Lopseypop: no Hwei out for smolder Kappa
[1:45:24] Amaresu_: i cannot get over how insanity went from 4-0 thanos hwei to.. what hapens in the rest of the game. there s a reason faker goes zhonyas on hwei ori taliyah.. that combo makes you immortal.

[1:46:57] weak_mental_renekton: ty
[1:47:13] mainanalyst: yeah it says 10 hours time, im looking at hoodies
[1:47:14] Amaresu_: also i thought jayce should just bite the bullet and go cleaver this game especially since bvoy didnt go ldr till 4th item.. he s never gonna do dmg anyway being so behind.
[1:47:15] Ikancast: they stack? thats convenient
[1:47:25] Amaresu_: and he has no conq anyway he s completely useless.
[1:47:27] Limpy7030: do the clothes run true to size or a little big/small?
[1:47:37] goldensleetix: @MonteCristo any thoughts on the idea that buffs/nerfs arent as impactful as everyone thinks since most kills in LOL are over done by hundreds of HP anyways?
[1:48:10] Limpy7030: perfect ty!

[1:52:21] Amaresu_: hwei is xerath with more options and shield/ms boost + no channeling
[1:52:23] madiiiman: riot wanted their version of invoker. instead they did this. no balls shudv made an actual invoker
[1:52:39] Amaresu_: cryptbloom vs no mr but zhonyas..
[1:52:40] maletroll: mercs are enough Kappa
[1:52:46] ManBearPig2992: sneaky smolder > tomo smolder no cap
[1:52:48] madiiiman: ya earlier you said "normally as long as ypi have an item, the choice of item wont decide the game" this is the game where it matters
[1:52:53] Amaresu_: i guess gnar has a cloak now but still..
[1:53:09] Amaresu_: not like zhonyas is 0 dmg item when its 120 AP
[1:53:40] Tolchy: diminishing returns on just stacking dmg when you can already reck them
[1:53:42] madiiiman: starting now is a tomo masterxclas
[1:53:42] ThatLatvianGuy: t1 vs gen is only 1.8 to 2 odds, t1 fans must be calmed down by oner sub
[1:53:45] madiiiman: for the ages
[1:53:52] madiiiman: smolder is luigi monte
[1:54:01] madiiiman: watch luigi win by doingremember
[1:54:08] madiiiman: doing absolutely nothing
[1:54:17] TheFissk: He built like SRs winning lanes would do dmg but forgot its fake god and bvoy
[1:54:22] madiiiman: HERE'S TOMO
[1:54:28] CrossGuz: rod builds into zhonya?
[1:54:31] madiiiman: THE CLEANSE FLASH
[1:54:33] unknown87644: look at what tomo did this fight @MonteCristo
[1:54:33] madiiiman: LMAO
[1:54:39] LilGimli: vs taliyah naut he prob dies if he uses armguard anyway
[1:54:42] Amaresu_: bvoy no ldr so does no dmg even tho playing so well
[1:54:44] madiiiman: ICANT
[1:55:01] madiiiman: monte look at him panic hit all his buttons before dying
[1:55:06] najafan: Insanity?
[1:55:17] Amaresu_: bvoy does really well to oneshot smolder
[1:55:19] 4blaze2that0: look tomo summs
[1:55:25] Amaresu_: but no reason to go all in vs mega
[1:55:27] smparrish_95: imagine if he had arm guard lol

[1:56:09] Tpro83: Lots of Lucian dashes
[1:56:11] TheFissk: Tomo doesn't want to be flamed for dying with sums up
[1:56:17] Amaresu_: sucks watching bvoy do no dmg on frontline cause nonldr 3rd
[1:56:20] Clyde1500: tomo plays it well but he does 0 damage
[1:56:32] 4blaze2that0: surely you mean bvoy
[1:56:34] Amaresu_: just go ldr 3rd. navori doesnt do anything if u can perma dash if u do no dmg

[1:57:58] Amaresu_: insanity if i speak i will be in big trouble
[1:58:00] mainanalyst: ??

[2:00:48] Lopseypop: if you put it out before whoever you have at 1 will lose.
[2:00:50] Amaresu_: xD not gonna happen. T1 learned to ban maokai vi against geng. geng have to wait for playoffs for zeri lulu to have a chance and it wont be enough.
[2:00:50] smparrish_95: monte is the Illuminati confirmed?
[2:00:58] ThatLatvianGuy: milkyway will 1v5 vs BLG Prayge
[2:01:02] fernysilva19: Then post before so t1 lose
[2:01:07] najafan: Monte is living in Foucault's Pendulum confirmed.

[2:01:37] TheFissk: The script writers at riot still hold a grudge and do what ever they need to mess Monte up
[2:02:04] NetherZone: hey had a question for yall!  would you know what an account with silver kayle riot kayle and judgement kayle is worth approximately
[2:02:17] willy8373: bakedog
[2:02:28] ThatLatvianGuy: @NetherZone Susge
[2:02:29] Amaresu_: ikr..
[2:02:51] willy8373: bakedog is so bad
[2:02:51] 4blaze2that0: latter
[2:02:51] Amaresu_: revenge jayce would be 5-0 instead and have cleaver for lucian
[2:02:53] madiiiman: flash in
[2:02:57] ohsomagical_: guess ill just die
[2:02:59] najafan: @NetherZone Selling accounts is against riot's terms of service and nobody in Montecristo's chat condones it. ^TM
[2:03:01] dah777: flash forward and kill taliah Keepo
[2:03:01] smparrish_95: flash is for the weak
[2:03:05] Mykah9: I think ask what drake would do
[2:03:07] unknown87644: i agree but didnt fakegod deserve a chance after winning NACL twice in a row
[2:03:08] LilGimli: yeah but youd have to pay licorice and revenge
[2:03:09] Tolchy: It looked like he was almost safe at tower before he jumped back in LUL
[2:03:09] brandn0007: Greed the flash
[2:03:09] suav0115: gotta hit that guy as you go down
[2:03:10] Swish214: I’m silver so I think fight
[2:03:16] hynterman: NA jayce is alive and well
[2:03:17] fortant69: that was the most north american jayce play ever
[2:03:22] AType: what do you think of Sniper @MonteCristo
[2:03:24] ThatLatvianGuy: @najafan fk riots rules NODDERS
[2:03:34] zanchu: man is this another NA Jayce classic
[2:03:44] NetherZone: @ThatLatvianGuy 100%
[2:03:47] Amaresu_: sniper is good. he needs more experience thats all.
[2:03:52] NetherZone: legit I have that account from season 1
[2:03:54] Amaresu_: how good is quid btw
[2:04:01] NetherZone: and I want to get it to someone who would use it
[2:04:05] Amaresu_: and river
[2:04:21] Sp0rkt: Sp0rkt subscribed with Prime. 
[2:04:24] 4blaze2that0: I can see sniper replacing fudge on c9 eventually
[2:04:29] 4blaze2that0: surely 4 years of fudge is enough
[2:04:38] Amaresu_: @4blaze2that0 Aware
[2:04:47] Sp0rkt: Ok back to youtube.  Laters
[2:04:57] Giiino: bowser rammus or bust
[2:04:59] Lopseypop: 2$ and mediocre sandwich
[2:05:00] thelipprechaun: whats the lcs raccoon thing about?
[2:05:02] cellkatin: do you have any advice on how to be present and notice what happens in a pro match? i mostly just listen to the co streamer and fail to keep up
[2:05:10] Amaresu_: insanity insta dead vs taliyah naut without zhonyas
[2:05:14] ThatLatvianGuy: it's a refresher from Dom's chat with gamba addict 1st time chatters, now it's account sellers
[2:05:16] Amaresu_: and game is boom
[2:05:21] LilGimli: but even with zhonyas he dies no?
[2:05:30] edenjtv: he didn't even have to buying the deathcap like he only had 1 rod in inventory he could've bought zhonya's instead lmao
[2:05:33] LightfellowFGC: Preflash, no?
[2:05:33] LilGimli: zhonyas doesnt fix the positioning and he just gets focused when it runs out
[2:05:49] fortant69: with zhonyas he can at least block the naut ult and maybe flash to safety
[2:05:50] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:05:55] Amaresu_: lol no if he insta zhonyas he doesnt die cause taliyah has no dmg after and he has seraphs to walk it out anyaay
[2:06:06] TheFissk: C9 doesn't need a Sniper who really wants to carry the game. They need someone boring to enable Jojo and Zerker @4blaze2that0
[2:06:24] Amaresu_: but he positioned poorly anyway while also not having zhonyas
[2:06:29] najafan: If Berserker sticks around.
[2:06:29] LilGimli: no chance he walks out after that, he's in the middle of the DIG, and they dont have a frontline to buy him space
[2:06:35] Amaresu_: yeah poke comp needs vision setup first
[2:06:51] Amaresu_: if volibear was maokai would be BiS
[2:06:52] Dandimite777: Dandimite777 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:07:07] LilGimli: zhonyas flash doesnt get him out of there
[2:07:15] LightfellowFGC: Flash does though
[2:07:43] Play_Time7: I think i fell asleep around here dont even know who won
[2:07:47] dah777: or have a kench eat him Keepo
[2:08:03] LightfellowFGC: He flashes, the wall doesn't knock him up, Taliyah doesn't reach him
[2:08:05] Amaresu_: if he zhonyas taliyah naut he can flash out with seraphs of remainder of dmg which would be nothing without taliyah w (which would ve been zhonyasd)
[2:08:06] LightfellowFGC: No?
[2:08:21] TheFissk: @play_time7 neither team won this game. One team just lost harder
[2:08:27] SaltineCracker94: Yeah
[2:08:33] Amaresu_: but as i said he positioned poorly from this point onwards even if he had zhonyas he deserved to die in a lot of situations
[2:08:53] jpegexe: he gets knocked up by the taliyah wall
[2:08:54] Amaresu_: yeah agreed
[2:08:57] dah777: flash then zhonyas?
[2:09:29] dah777: xdd
[2:09:48] barcodebelle: monte have you watched TL/C9 or are you going chronologically

[2:10:43] Amaresu_: milio would ve been so much better than nami too
[2:10:45] barcodebelle: there will be content for summoning insight
[2:10:46] edenjtv: I wish berserker would get on a good team in the LCK
[2:10:46] Amaresu_: vs sej

[2:12:06] FannyBabbs: yeah insanity boned some plays, but his topside wasn't doing anything to help
[2:13:11] smparrish_95: how does Tomo have 450 stacks and do nothing?
[2:13:19] Amaresu_: huge top gap but insanity threw this game
[2:13:36] Giiino: thats damn near captain jack esque
[2:13:55] dgonsays: monte wtf is a racoon feast
[2:14:03] LightfellowFGC: Yeah I don't know, Smolder with 400 stacks should be unlosable by any competent team
[2:14:04] FannyBabbs: yeah i think that comp looks a lot different if fakegod is an intermediate malphite bot

[2:23:29] 4blaze2that0: went pta smolder and had to play with it
[2:23:40] najafan: @Sniper13x Why?
[2:23:41] rfarleydude97: KEKW
[2:24:01] Sniper13x: im asking. is she good now?
[2:24:05] 4blaze2that0: this is why the start is delayed
[2:24:07] madiiiman: night chat. work in 4 hours cuz my bday has to have work and class on it lol
[2:24:10] 4blaze2that0: u can skip a bit
[2:24:12] najafan: @Sniper13x C9 played her last game.
[2:24:18] Sniper13x: oh
[2:24:19] najafan: She was strong.
[2:24:21] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman goodluck and hbd!
[2:24:26] Sniper13x: thanx
[2:24:49] weak_mental_renekton: do you prefer senna or smolder late? Senna is a soloq counter from outranging
[2:24:49] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:25:11] VehementPhoenix: Honestly its so absurd Smolder is getting so many free lanes. You can literally pick Pyke/Leona/etc into him and he just chain dies
[2:25:23] najafan: I miss Impact on C9 man.
[2:25:58] rfarleydude97: ??????????
[2:25:59] Giiino: good tweet good tweet
[2:26:01] rfarleydude97: what the fuck
[2:26:06] weak_mental_renekton: @VehementPhoenix or he gets through lane and the pyke ends up useless in teamfights
[2:26:07] najafan: What is this chatGPT generated shit
[2:26:10] BigMightyena: DIESOFCRINGE
[2:26:10] dgonsays: its the dragon meme
[2:26:22] Fire_elemen6: But it had a funny dragon gif
[2:26:49] Novensiles: the LCS should adopt a 0 meme policy so they have to try to learn to be legitimately entertaining
[2:26:51] sheald_bot: C9 coach needs to put Fudge pack on tank duty
[2:26:57] 1920_: @dgonsays Hi dad
[2:26:57] VehementPhoenix: @weak_mental_renekton Idk man. I think its so free. Smolder is a useless champ propped up by the current bot meta.
[2:27:03] spucky117: best meme of the week was zeyzals burn of LCS VCT and rito all in one answer
[2:27:11] najafan: @sheald_bot Correct.
[2:27:26] BigMightyena: LUL
[2:27:31] Fire_elemen6: Maybe they should replace the random tweets with APA all chat
[2:27:32] spucky117: :kekw
[2:27:41] 1920_: some of the production seems so forced man
[2:27:46] weak_mental_renekton: @VehementPhoenix why is he useless?
[2:28:35] spucky117: imagine casting one day a week and not "having time" to figure out the global meta on your own
[2:28:44] sheald_bot: He didn't trust the NA Jayce to be a dmg source
[2:28:54] najafan: Could be that Ivern+Daisy is enough tank and they need the AP.
[2:29:04] VehementPhoenix: @weak_mental_renekton Im exaggerating, but he is very abusable bot. Teams just arent picking the champs that abuse him. You really can pick a bot capable of all-inn'ing and just walk at him. He does 0 damage.
[2:29:11] Scruffymonkeh: goofy aaah top lane skirmish
[2:29:19] AdmiralReggie: monkaS
[2:29:38] rfarleydude97: YEON KEKW
[2:29:40] fortant69: that whole exchange was kinda troll

[2:29:55] Giiino: thats my adc FeelsBadMan
[2:29:57] spucky117: tasty trash
[2:30:18] barcodebelle: naut hook
[2:30:21] barcodebelle: on smolder
[2:30:25] barcodebelle: i mean senna
[2:30:40] 4blaze2that0: berserker 5Head
[2:30:44] weak_mental_renekton: @VehementPhoenix I'm down for that but senna seems to be real good into smolder and a much safer option
[2:30:49] ThatLatvianGuy: not that core isn't washed but i'm sad as fk to see topside being wasted with yeon AAAA
[2:30:50] najafan: Love to see my hyper carry with lategame runes get an early gill
[2:30:55] Halalpillango: CtpFlowers so good GIGACHAD
[2:30:58] najafan: kill*
[2:31:19] goldensleetix: im confused how senna hasnt been nerfed more
[2:31:36] 1920_: the Jax gets huge and still is useless in team fights
[2:31:52] Scruffymonkeh: i feel like a better player didnt need to flash that naut
[2:31:54] 1920_: @goldensleetix Phreak needs to play it for LP
[2:31:55] weak_mental_renekton: @goldensleetix balance team has a senna main
[2:32:09] VehementPhoenix: @weak_mental_renekton Senna is not a bad champ. But Smolder can free farm and stack up. And he scales into teamfight wins fastrer than she does. The way you beat Smolder is by constantly engaging on him. If you do that he literally cannot play the game and will not hit lategame OP status until like 50 mins
[2:32:11] weak_mental_renekton: (I joke but prolly)
[2:32:20] 4blaze2that0: he flashed to not get stunned by rocks
[2:32:36] goldensleetix: i thought rekkles was paying someone at rito (joke)
[2:32:49] psych2416256: but we had to see the tahm backing
[2:32:52] najafan: @VehementPhoenix Sure, sure. Now how does Lucian leave him alone?
[2:33:08] VehementPhoenix: @weak_mental_renekton Go pick Pyke into Smolder right now and you will understand. He does not exist as a champ. You do not even need to be good at Pyke
[2:33:15] gaussjd: i got the feeling that Jojopyun gonna do decent on international tournaments . He looks solid
[2:33:47] weak_mental_renekton: @VehementPhoenix I don't think smolder free farms, he's 6 cs pm. Senna outranges and farms free senna stacks and is more useful until late.
[2:34:04] 4blaze2that0: jojo is pretty 1v9 this game except one play ( Aware )
[2:34:37] Solomonike: @4blaze2that0 idk vulcan played pretty well this game
[2:34:48] 4blaze2that0: yea not rly 1v9 but he had the flashiest moments
[2:34:52] weak_mental_renekton: @VehementPhoenix also I don't think LCS supps are practicing pyke in this meta, and again he falls off hard in pro play teamfights
[2:34:57] VehementPhoenix: @najafan Lucian basically never has a good all-in because he is paired with Nami. He does do a lot of damage, but Smolder can sit back and farm stacks because he is so low range. Lucian with and engage support instead of Nami who lands a bubble every 6 years would farm Smolder
[2:34:57] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:35:31] gaussjd: Jojo might just be the top 2 western mid after Caps
[2:36:04] VehementPhoenix: @weak_mental_renekton A useless Pyke is less useless than a useless Smolder because Smolder regularly is the primary damage dealer. Pyke takes the place of something like Nami, which is often useless adjacent midgame
[2:36:22] fortant69: i see umti has acclimated to NA already
[2:37:00] ThatLatvianGuy: @VehementPhoenix nah, pyke can be completely useless, smolder can at least get to 225 if you drag it out
[2:37:52] TheFissk: Giving up 6 grubs when you have a Jayce is tragic
[2:37:59] Brain_on_Twist: misleading stream title
[2:38:11] 4blaze2that0: this one is also long but it's much more exciting imo
[2:38:13] najafan: ;)
[2:38:16] Brain_on_Twist: bangers only lol
[2:38:17] rfarleydude97: LMAO
[2:38:17] Solomonike: @TheFissk the issue was the ivern so trash at getting grubs
[2:38:38] ohsomagical_: Monte always satisfies my middle of the night needs
[2:38:42] Phandoms: wondering why no1 is playing nautilus supp in low elo soloq lol
[2:38:53] 4blaze2that0: it's too easy to int on naut
[2:39:02] OMGColin: thanks for streamin
[2:39:11] barcodebelle: monte is satisfying my needs now - I'm currently high and eating trolli sour brite crawlers, thanks last free nation
[2:39:18] frozensage: hypeeeee
[2:39:27] fortant69: its probably for the best they dont pick nautilus in your low elo games hes just going to Q into the enemy team a lot anyways
[2:39:29] VehementPhoenix: @ThatLatvianGuy You're just assuming semi neutral game states. Smolder takes a LONG time to catch up to a traditional ADC fed with several kills and plates. We are just so used to watching Smolders chill and free farm we think that is the only way. Smolder is Bjergsens Zilean in NA.
[2:39:34] weak_mental_renekton: @VehementPhoenix I'm down for some pyke, draven, etc. Hope we get to see it
[2:39:42] Scruffymonkeh: @phandoms  legal legos engage champs require trust, and low elo is a low trust environment
[2:39:47] TheFissk: @phandoms you go in and your team watches you die 1v5
[2:40:01] najafan: @VehementPhoenix Smolder looks fine in LCK, what are you on?
[2:40:01] Moobot: MonteCristo's latest global League of Legends power rankings can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtSUNck-SkM
[2:40:14] Brain_on_Twist: idk that ability seems really normal to me and rteally balanced
[2:40:22] Brain_on_Twist: i love senna really good in my games
[2:40:40] VehementPhoenix: @najafan I don't see LCK supports counter picking him. I see LCK supports picking normal, farm it out stuff
[2:40:55] Capt_Hammer: I'm surprised they event left senna or taliyah up, she seems OP in LCK
[2:41:03] Capt_Hammer: they seem*
[2:41:15] najafan: @VehementPhoenix Sure, whatever, doesn't matter, don't care. You said it was a Bjergsen Zilean in NA thing. It isn't.
[2:41:18] rfarleydude97: WTF IS THIS FILTER
[2:41:27] Brain_on_Twist: senna has a crazy win rate in lck rn
[2:41:30] ThatLatvianGuy: @Capt_Hammer apa taliyah hits different than kr  taliyah
[2:41:48] TheFissk: Lck is aware of lanes other than mid, which makes taliyah a lot stronger
[2:41:49] Bladetykon: is that happeneing everytime 2 dragons are dead?
[2:42:03] Dr_Roti: @ThatLatvianGuy hits? xDD
[2:42:12] Brain_on_Twist: holy shit that visual bug
[2:42:26] ThatLatvianGuy: @Dr_Roti CAUGHT
[2:42:28] weak_mental_renekton: @Bladetykon yep
[2:42:50] 4blaze2that0: jojo is up 10-20 cs at 14 in every lane it's crazy
[2:43:08] VehementPhoenix: @najafan It was an analogy. Meaning people arent punishing it. The "in NA" part was part of the analogy because the Zilean didnt work at worlds because people punished it. It's just my opinion that Smolder is less good than people think because they are not counterint it properly. You are free to disagree.
[2:43:29] Bladetykon: what are we figting for?
[2:43:36] ThatLatvianGuy: calm down with essaying chatter
[2:43:36] 4blaze2that0: smolder stacks
[2:43:38] 4blaze2that0: LUL
[2:43:41] weak_mental_renekton: why are we figting for drake right now
[2:43:47] VehementPhoenix: @najafan Once botlane is telegraphed, Smolder is a turbo pick.
[2:44:07] rfarleydude97: APA?
[2:44:07] 4blaze2that0: so it begins
[2:44:09] Giiino: wellp
[2:44:13] najafan: There are a variety of things in league people don't punish. Bjerg's Zilean was unique in that it was region dominant but easily countered outside the region.
[2:44:19] Scruffymonkeh: kinda messy to keep the jax insulated but it worked i guess
[2:44:23] najafan: This is clearly not analogous.
[2:44:34] Giiino: would you believe me if i said that wasnt apa's worst tp of this game
[2:44:38] 4blaze2that0: yep
[2:44:43] 4blaze2that0: this isn't even the worst LUL
[2:44:49] VehementPhoenix: @najafan All true. I was just using it as a reference point. Give people time to figure it out.
[2:44:55] LilGimli: turns out maybe pyosik was right LUL
[2:45:01] spucky117: cristoLCS cristoLCS cristoLCS
[2:45:01] Fire_elemen6: You sound like you didn't enjoy the teleport into flash die

[2:45:34] Phandoms: the commentary is on fleek lmao
[2:45:39] weak_mental_renekton: proactive player
[2:45:48] Im_Nikko: he knows something we dont
[2:45:50] Bladetykon: time to flame your team for being out of position
[2:45:55] Im_Nikko: next level
[2:45:57] VerbalHorse: He just stands there
[2:46:06] Fire_elemen6: CC indicators require staff
[2:46:13] TheFissk: Good game, no bug
[2:46:19] Sniper13x: there was a guy responsible for all the cc indicators
[2:46:21] LilGimli: dont think we had indicators last game
[2:46:21] Halalpillango: CC indicator guy got axed Sadge
[2:46:25] ThatLatvianGuy: cc indicators left to vslorant
[2:46:30] topalphadog1: CC indicator got laid off
[2:46:31] najafan: @VehementPhoenix I also want to stress that the ADC/Support pairs you want people to pick are highly volatile, and if they fail to pressure Smolder sufficiently they're useless later in the game. Lucian is paired with Nami because Nami has some early pressure as well as INTENSE UTILITY LATER.
[2:46:36] LilGimli: there werent any indicators when we were going over insanity mid play
[2:46:43] Bladetykon: @ThatLatvianGuy to another region with better play
[2:46:55] najafan: Lucian Pyke would not be like this.
[2:46:58] jerckysminion: chest n triceps done with monte stream in my ear
[2:47:04] Fire_elemen6: They didn't put any indicators in the broom closet
[2:47:16] Ritashi2: cc indicators confuse the NA viewers
[2:47:33] Spawnthecaster: wow i really hope the left team wins
[2:47:33] jerckysminion: i do mostly cable stuff for triceps honestly
[2:47:41] LilGimli: @Spawnthecaster o/
[2:47:52] weak_mental_renekton: how is smolder 3 levels up
[2:47:53] jerckysminion: the only one i do with a dumbbell or barbell is skullcrushers
[2:47:56] ThatLatvianGuy: @jerckysminion BASED can squeeze more out with cable
[2:48:01] Spawnthecaster: i just finished 5 hours of meetings and reviews
[2:48:03] Spawnthecaster: :D
[2:48:06] VehementPhoenix: @najafan All true. I don't disagree. I'm just saying Smolder is a sitting duck for awhile. Picks exist for those scenarios. Trying to go even in farm is not the answer.
[2:48:09] LilGimli: cables much better for triceps
[2:48:17] Amaresu_: i was falling asleep during this game but jojo's 1v9 woke me up
[2:48:20] Clyde1500: what about a 6th hour dedicated solely to TPs?
[2:48:21] jerckysminion: @ThatLatvianGuy i use cable prefer cause it keeps tension on your arms more
[2:48:31] KnowP4in: apa tp Aware
[2:48:34] LilGimli: hard to do tricep work w/constant tension
[2:48:34] Spawnthecaster: and its the 2nd worst tp of the game. there another banger coming
[2:48:41] jerckysminion: with a dumbbell u lose tension once u fully extend
[2:48:48] weak_mental_renekton: (and APA had 2x supp bot lane helping him)
[2:49:12] Capt_Hammer: TBH, i'd rather see APA then some of the retirees we've had the last few years
[2:49:16] Bladetykon: @Spawnthecaster is left the right choice or the only one left?
[2:49:23] ThatLatvianGuy: @jerckysminion yep, what i mean, but worded poorly
[2:49:31] Spawnthecaster: yeah i think that was our best game by far. we have good tempo plays at time. now to figure out the old team fighting aspect of the game.
[2:49:54] Fire_elemen6: They learned from ImaQTpie's legendary line. "We're playing the map and mapping the plays"
[2:50:11] jerckysminion: @LilGimli that's not true at all u just have to figure out the weight better

[2:50:18] rfarleydude97: kekw
[2:50:22] fartnugget45: this game was winnable by TL until APA had a big oopsie bot lane
[2:50:22] Amaresu_: xD
[2:50:22] MansoGanzo: KEKW

[2:50:36] Spawnthecaster: path of exile league of legends. got it.
[2:50:41] Amaresu_: how does he even reply to that
[2:50:45] OMGColin: spawn i'm still a fan, lets go man
[2:50:55] fistigons25: @fartnugget45 not just winnable, they were literally winning the game before that blunder
[2:50:56] LilGimli: @jerckysminion i meant w/o cables, aside from skullcrushers/behind the head extensions, both of which are better to do w/cables tbh
[2:51:01] Giiino: how doesnt fudge get exploded there man. shouldve been a tl won fight
[2:51:10] Stealthling_: I love how aggressive jojo plays on Azir
[2:51:19] 1DeepBlue: teasing aside, APA did so much work that fight
[2:51:19] SiIentShadows: thats so unfortunate LUL
[2:51:32] weak_mental_renekton: still 3 lvl adc lead
[2:51:33] thisisKakashi: this is a serps fang angle
[2:51:35] thisisKakashi: for senna
[2:51:39] Solvum: i think he shouldve targeted the ivern right
[2:51:40] najafan: Smolder has splash damage. Was impossible to see stacks before this.
[2:51:47] najafan: They just never clicked on Smolder.
[2:51:48] BORED2212: have you already watched fpx vs nip and wbg?
[2:51:59] heeman1119: its almost like if he wasnt 50 cs behind he could actually do something
[2:52:00] psych2416256: yeon missed ult or is it just me?
[2:52:14] xhibiti0n: hello you sexy bastards
[2:52:22] najafan: Why, oh why, won't the overlay let us see stacks?
[2:52:23] ThatLatvianGuy: @xhibiti0n no u
[2:52:34] xhibiti0n: @ThatLatvianGuy u rite
[2:52:41] nighkey: umti was sitting on the ward i think. they knew he was there
[2:52:57] BORED2212: cblol has the best overlay and they have a sign language interpreter
[2:53:07] 4blaze2that0: surely the game is over now Clueless
[2:53:18] Fire_elemen6: He stacked by pressing his attacks
[2:53:28] velvetblanc: what's the sign language for 'terrible teleport'
[2:53:31] najafan: Huh, TIL.
[2:53:46] thisisKakashi: he sins again, dw
[2:53:49] themisterkap: wait until a TP later
[2:54:13] thisisKakashi: if senna doesn't buy serps fang ill cry
[2:54:19] BORED2212: @velvetblanc i imagine its the same sign for nisqy
[2:54:25] archie7497: Oh just wait. APA will make you want to end the stream a few more times
[2:54:32] Dr_Roti: maybe he thought he was getting collapsed on for the next tp since there wwere some c9 members in bot jg
[2:54:38] rfarleydude97: ???
[2:54:43] Spawnthecaster: that was so bullshit btw. baron on c9 team?
[2:54:43] ThatLatvianGuy: o7
[2:54:46] VerbalHorse: the baron assist LUL
[2:55:09] archie7497: @spawnthecaster mate how high was APA during this game?

[2:55:43] thisisKakashi: maybe cuz he pressed q on the baron
[2:55:49] topalphadog1: Classic UmTi
[2:55:57] sundaeninho: Hey Monte, did you see the POG leaderboard of LCK? I believe Zeka is 3rd or smtg, what a gem in the making
[2:56:01] fortant69: im surprised it reaches that far
[2:56:02] thisisKakashi: how does the baron AI work, is there any documentation on this shit
[2:56:08] Fire_elemen6: That's what happens when you kick a baron
[2:56:13] TheFissk: Baron is a C9 fan
[2:56:25] DannieBoyRTS: That's been a thing since season 5
[2:56:36] spucky117: i cant believe we racoons didnt demand the trash banger of kt vs dk before the lcs
[2:56:37] MissingMatter: It's rude for people to be able to attack baron and he can't hit back.
[2:56:38] fortant69: the tentacle can hit you outside of the pit but ive never seen it go that far away from the wall
[2:56:39] fartnugget45: jack called in the fix
[2:56:42] weak_mental_renekton: could old barron do that>
[2:56:44] ThatLatvianGuy: just fun and interactive gameplay
[2:57:11] pilotjunkie: monte hasn't seen kt vs damwon yet xdd
[2:57:31] SiIentShadows: senna lvl 9 >.>
[2:57:35] ohsomagical_: just tanking baron
[2:57:35] stephcurrysim: is this game live? can i bet on TL
[2:57:44] Giiino: baron redeems himself by murdering c9
[2:57:46] Scruffymonkeh: 2tps paid tho
[2:57:50] thisisKakashi: yea this is the downside to farming senna, 3 levels down enemy ad
[2:58:02] thisisKakashi: to fasting*
[2:58:10] ThatLatvianGuy: at least kt lost
[2:58:12] vrozeus: will we get bangers only for kt d+?
[2:58:15] fartnugget45: kt vs damwon was so bad. was fun watching caedrel lose his mind though

[3:13:11] ThatLatvianGuy: #liquidIV
[3:13:19] PapaSmithy: why Jake why would you do that
[3:13:21] spacepope20k: @PapaSmithy being in the LEC takes real bravery tbh. tough region. no criticism of it or anything. kudos to all of you (and the NACL lads)
[3:13:24] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I think you'd have to be on some CERTAIN liquids to coach TL
[3:13:25] spacepope20k: LEC / LCS
[3:13:26] DesperateApe: Has monte watched fpx vs nip
[3:13:29] Scruffymonkeh: hes one of us, he knows what he signed up for
[3:13:38] PapaSmithy: you should check the tl subreddit
[3:13:40] PapaSmithy: they have fangs
[3:13:51] archie7497: Liquid has fans?
[3:13:52] ThatLatvianGuy: liquidIV means liquid4, is TL sponsored by them?
[3:13:55] Spawnthecaster: haha discord is better than reddit. the reddit is the elephant graveyard
[3:13:56] SiIentShadows: tl subreddit wasnt kind at all Despairge
[3:13:58] pluristpurist: c9 and liquid subs are nuts
[3:14:03] Spawnthecaster: we dont trespass there
[3:14:16] BORED2212: @montecristo did you know milkyway is contracted to rng, the goat could be contract prisoned
[3:14:23] ohsomagical_: bring back blabers nidalee LUL
[3:14:29] PapaSmithy: hooray for china illegal loans

[3:15:13] Stealthling_: yea that wouldnt work Clueless
[3:15:17] IEatLamas: Wait why would that ever happen?
[3:15:19] jerckysminion: china is riot games cause tencent is governement owned
[3:15:29] hkshift: Monte do you know why Riot allows casters (Bren/Sideshow/Balla) to co stream VCT? do they have more leverage than league casters?
[3:15:31] LilGimli: something something doublelift relegation?
[3:15:32] Komarimasita: this sounds like an anakin meme
[3:15:46] commando1814: that seems super fucking murky
[3:15:54] jerckysminion: overlord china always bigger
[3:15:55] Zebrios: Guys, we have to save Papa from the CCP's prison camp monkaW

[3:15:56] azzlo3: @PapaSmithy china is best rules. China always triumph. Glory to China and greatest leader Xi Jinping
[3:15:58] Kodord: i love tencent cant wait to install vanguard to play tft!
[3:16:10] PapaSmithy: one of the more interesting things is that demon1 and other players costream the games they're in while they're playing (their mods do a watchparty)

[3:16:33] jerckysminion: @PapaSmithy yeah that's a pretty cool one
[3:16:35] diddyfitty: Bren and Sideshow were costreaming pre-Riot contracts too tho
[3:16:37] weak_mental_renekton: its so weird how u can costream some regions and not others (IWD LPL/LCS not LCK/LEC)
[3:16:38] LilGimli: or what possible reason there could be for dom not to get LEC rights
[3:16:53] archie7497: Funny how one of the first sus loans was DL to TL in 2017 relegations
[3:17:01] kshyle: @weak_mental_renekton dom got lck rights a while back
[3:17:02] 4blaze2that0: @weak_mental_renekton dom has lck rights now
[3:17:04] ThatLatvianGuy: @weak_mental_renekton dom now has lck
[3:17:08] PapaSmithy: meanwhile nacl casters are banned from costreaming nacl days they're not on
[3:17:08] hkshift: @PapaSmithy I absolutely would've bought the FlyQuest team capsule, im sure player card wouldve been fire with a green classic
[3:17:10] PapaSmithy: v. nice system
[3:17:10] weak_mental_renekton: sick
[3:17:18] Spawnthecaster: ah yes where we win the game
[3:17:24] OceanLegacy: you should see sen zellsis's costream while he is playing on stage, it is peak satire
[3:17:32] BORED2212: @lilgimli apparently hes not big enough, big enough for lpl,lck,lcs,msi, worlds but too small for lec

[3:22:23] Solomonike: @ohsomagical_ ofc bro is playing smolder he does zero dmg till 20 mins into the game lmfao
[3:22:29] ThatLatvianGuy: we're going to lcs drake classic
[3:22:37] thisisKakashi: Even if jojo doesn't play well there he didn't even need to use his zhonyas
[3:22:45] weak_mental_renekton: 3 drakes up = lose in LCS
[3:22:48] thisisKakashi: they have everyone alive C9 and they are trying to dive azir in their base
[3:22:48] Wisherex: C9 had a micropause for Beserker runes at the start, the game was rigged from the beginning Kappa
[3:22:48] Giiino: least frustrating TL game tbh
[3:22:56] kshyle: @ohsomagical_ did you see tomo smolder - I'd rather have this catdespair
[3:22:57] Zebrios: Jojo plays that so so well.
[3:23:13] yuio3456: unless they oneshot jojo the collapse is always gonna come too soon for that play
[3:23:21] PapaSmithy: impact's so funny man

[3:23:54] Capt_Hammer: is rell no longer viable? Didn't keep up with latest patch
[3:24:01] ohsomagical_: who gets MVP this split
[3:24:07] thisisKakashi: rell inted me in a soloq game earlier today, champs shit
[3:24:11] Zebrios: It's because Inspired is saying what we're all thinking instead of being a normal caster
[3:24:12] thisisKakashi: jk idk
[3:24:27] NitroDavid: does smolder and elder stack?
[3:24:29] Capt_Hammer: Just wondering how different the game would be if they played harder engage jungler like rell or vi
[3:24:37] AsfandorLoL: do you not just get liandrys last item on smolder here?
[3:24:43] Capt_Hammer: Didn't see draft though =\ so don't know what happened
[3:24:47] AType: I don’t like blaber on I been it feels wrong
[3:24:52] Im_Nikko: is this the last one ?

[3:25:35] Capt_Hammer: nabori
[3:25:37] thisisKakashi: dying on that hill
[3:25:46] BORED2212: do you like the tank azir build?
[3:26:00] leamfor: Impact started in 2012 - 12 years ago man. Aware
[3:26:10] Zebrios: I hate the argument of "he's a world champion" when it was from 2013.  Like none of that game knowledge is relevant to today's version of League.

[4:05:34] Stealthling_: Balatro is a poker rogue like, very fun to play
[4:05:37] SaltineCracker94: Balatro is a roguelike deck builder
[4:05:39] EvolutionWar: Hey guys we are also watching a small indie company right now, Rito cookies just FYI xD

[4:10:52] SiIentShadows: "flank"
