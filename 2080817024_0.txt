[1:19:41] vrgambit: The legendary 4.5 ap comp
[1:19:42] xCaeIum: Omg what about “True CC” it ignores Tenacity. We make one broken champ with big dash and 2 point click stuns.. who is 100% True CC… classic Riot
[1:19:44] omnitrix925: tank senna IMO
[1:21:00] vrgambit: Biggest carry will need to be the enemy team walking into your fountain I think ur righy

[1:23:08] zzz_iton: who did
[1:23:10] coconutcock: ayeeeeeee
[1:23:26] loonaa: does that count as an instant chatban? how does that work when someone is system muted
[1:23:35] zzz_iton: instnat chat ban
[1:23:37] Telperion16: aww men as just as they are about to give out the season rewards, I think if you are muted and below honor 2 you don't get it
[1:23:37] vrgambit: System muted means instant punishment step
[1:23:38] Gamy1lol: There should be voice comms for Masters+

[1:25:22] xCaeIum: I mean… I’m just saying… I can think of atleast 5 Keria crazy kill moments this split but not a single Guma play…
[1:25:30] Mr_yellow7: I also agree. You’re glass cannon without the cannon
[1:25:42] loddenfps: you even get 1v1ed by enemy support

[1:26:25] MatthiasGlass: What is the weakest ADC right now?
[1:26:25] softlysupports: bot lane isnt a power couple
[1:26:25] Telperion16: No thank you owo just nerf everything else
[1:26:31] zzz_iton: but support varies tho right, like you pick all kind of champions
[1:26:49] xCaeIum: Nerf support, buff adc, 2 adc meta returns classic
[1:26:49] loddenfps: I've been playing adc since season 6 and every season that goes by I feel more useless
[1:27:19] xCaeIum: We blame Keria
[1:27:22] Gamy1lol: Support is kinda like a second jungler now
[1:27:24] R_i_e_s: Supports used to have almost no gold income and peel for ADC , now they're a 2nd jungler
[1:27:38] vogue_hommes: there's too much income you can pick any champ as support and get your core build
[1:28:36] Telperion16: Brand full build every game
[1:28:44] Gamy1lol: You would love to play Dota as Support
[1:29:12] djrichierich888: hey stunt thanks for the stream.  been playing on and off for 12 years and finally focused up and hit master this season. thanks for the tips and great content

[1:30:26] loddenfps: @R_i_e_s yes
[1:30:31] xCaeIum: I thought this was a Camille onetrick stream
[1:30:35] loddenfps: probably leona e too
[1:30:45] vogue_hommes: the turn rates ono
[1:30:56] romanmordiuk: can samira w cancel jannas ulti?
[1:31:02] loonaa: so much ability/item animation in dota, it looks so confusing
[1:31:28] loddenfps: bro I say Riot fires Phreak
[1:31:30] Gamy1lol: Supports in dota have 9 active items LUL
[1:31:35] Alyssandria: samira W cannot block Janna or naut ult
[1:31:36] loddenfps: he's been thrashing the game for years now
[1:31:38] Flarezard: @loonaa i still need to play dota peepoShy
[1:31:39] BaneBladeV: they can't nerf support. it's already picked 3% less than every other role
[1:31:46] jannablowsu: id be down for nerfs for supps
[1:31:46] Alyssandria: naut ult is underground
[1:31:47] iuni__: he does deserve all the hate
[1:31:56] iuni__: mf has turned his back on the community and more
[1:31:57] vrgambit: I still think they need to buff duo exp so if you stay in lane there's some gain
[1:31:58] softlysupports: if support does get nerfed then adc for sure has to be buffed right?
[1:32:01] Flarezard: i played brewmaster once and the game went too long and I just never played again

[1:32:45] loonaa: zyra zungle
[1:32:48] loddenfps: he's the face and "head" perse so if shit is bad then he has to go
[1:32:50] softlysupports: @iuni__ lol its a pretty tame, sane take
[1:32:53] vrgambit: Phreak is condescending and thinks the player base is filled with idiots
[1:32:55] kromeonn: @iuni__ relax drututMEGA
[1:32:55] Flarezard: ye i think phreak and his team have been more innovative than anything league has experienced in years
[1:32:57] jannablowsu: @softlysupports yeah thats what his opinion was supp be giga nerfed and adc giga buffed
[1:33:03] vrgambit: So people people hate on him

[1:33:39] Gamy1lol: This ashe is weird...
[1:33:50] vrgambit: I'm surprised brand flashed there
[1:34:06] loddenfps: @vrgambit he proves his points by saying a non-related fact like the shieldbow thing
[1:34:08] vogue_hommes: wait zyra is the jungler Susge
[1:34:27] loddenfps: where TTK went down because adcs were buying shieldbow so they werent gonna buff adcs because of that

[1:37:44] loddenfps: @vrgambit that made me so mad because a -0.0001 ttk with the amount of shield shieldbow gives is not making the role good and yet he made it look like he was right and that's it
[1:38:11] vrgambit: @stunt do you think Janna can buy a Dorans item effectively
[1:38:27] BaneBladeV: @vrgambit doran's seal :3

[3:25:13] Balldropper: yeah I think I have to wait like 3 or so hours
[3:25:24] Thommenius: Hayooo! Mornings! Was grabbing coffee before, was there any specific reason to pick nautilus?
[3:25:25] vrgambit: I've seen bf sword into the collector before
[3:25:34] vrgambit: And they go ie second from the bf
[3:25:39] polyTuff: @ThomasTheTwink mr twink you dont mind me calling you flower right owoTeddy
[3:25:44] Walt1stic: stunt on nautilus buying solstice means he rlly wants his lp
[3:25:49] Thommenius: stuntLove
[3:25:52] mellowmellonn: is it common for high elo players to change lanes mid game?
[3:26:29] ThomasTheTwink: @polytuff is fine hehe
[3:26:35] wwalessia: @mellowmellonn i think its just a common practice for bot to go mid after a while not necessarily in high elo
[3:26:37] mellowmellonn: woah interesting
[3:26:39] bladetrinity16: thomas bla
[3:26:41] wwalessia: to be close to help with obj
[3:27:03] wwalessia: + midlaners usually have tp
[3:27:05] ThomasTheTwink: stunt is on his rank 1 arc but lowkey ok
[3:27:08] mellowmellonn: i dont see that in my low elo lobby thats why i thought its a high elo thing
[3:27:12] vrgambit: Once upon a time it used to be bot swaps with top
[3:27:23] wwalessia: @mellowmellonn depends even in diamond some ppl just refuse to do it
[3:27:25] vrgambit: Remember that? Back when mid was an important role
[3:27:26] polyTuff: ew toplane gross
[3:27:28] bladetrinity16: its whoever needs the shorter lane to be safer for farming normally takes mid
[3:27:35] wwalessia: but its kinda int for midlaner not to side if he has tp
[3:27:38] Walt1stic: @mellowmellonn theyre just not aware of whats going on
[3:27:47] Walt1stic: even as you climb its hard to get people to do proper lane assignments
[3:27:52] Walt1stic: they become stubborn
[3:28:07] mellowmellonn: i see
[3:28:16] wwalessia: @Walt1stic i feel like a good portion of people just play games on autopilot outside of high elo
[3:28:18] Walt1stic: theres also nuances as stunt said based on champs and comps
[3:28:20] podduhh: in low elo’s its “stay in my lane until game ends” kinda mentality lol
[3:28:27] vrgambit: It happens the most when your mid laner locks a useless champ like xerath hwei or velkoz
[3:28:28] Thommenius: @mellowmellonn Also lower elo - think below gold - has longer laning phases than higher
[3:28:38] vrgambit: They can't side on those champs well
[3:28:38] Walt1stic: control mages like to stay mid, snowballing adc wants to trim outermost towers some comps play for sides so adc sides etc
[3:28:42] bladetrinity16: but if your mid laner refuses to move to a side lane, you may as well do it as adc, cause fighting for minions wiht your mid laner is bad for both of you
[3:28:58] Walt1stic: but yes generally after a tower (specially bot t1) falls, people start changing lanes
[3:29:17] Walt1stic: @wwalessia in high elo too tbh
[3:29:46] mellowmellonn: ohhh this is a lot to take in lmao
[3:29:56] wwalessia: @Walt1stic yeah i cant say above diamond cus idk but its crazy how people just default play without much thought into it even there
[3:30:02] vrgambit: Tldr bot should mid after turret falls or 15 mins
[3:30:35] Walt1stic: @vrgambit pretty much
[3:30:35] wwalessia: feels like people just flip the coin either a guaranteed win or free lose because they dont really wanna try for it
[3:30:40] Walt1stic: the nuance are just further optimizations
[3:30:57] brunohc1: is Draven a good adc to dedicate time to learn ?
[3:31:05] vrgambit: Sure
[3:31:10] Cupic: not stunt...
[3:31:20] reformedJay: Looking
[3:31:29] Walt1stic: they already play adc there isnt much left to deteriorate
[3:31:31] vrgambit: If you play draven too much you'll develop stage 4 and infect others in solo q
[3:31:31] bladetrinity16: what if i dont have a brain in the first place
[3:31:31] polyTuff: the way seraphine manifests cupic
[3:31:35] polyTuff: pfft
