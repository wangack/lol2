[4:47:16] Kizeur: StreamerAdvisor So many anti cheats work like that nowadays, ive told myself to not bother with it anymore
[4:48:19] armin_rah: Nice
[4:48:20] DialogueNPC: its understandable. many others have decided this .. likely even before release of such anticheat tools
[4:48:41] DialogueNPC: its not easy to stop playing league, or any other game you are invested in
[4:48:43] TadpoIeBro: 3%
[4:48:49] TadpoIeBro: personal estimate :)
[4:48:51] always_bet_jojo: im unistalling
[4:49:01] DialogueNPC: my estimate is 40% in 1 year
[4:49:16] Kizeur: I think it wont matter that much in total player count. Games like helldivers also have this kind of shit anticheat, I still play the game because its fun and wont worry anymore about these things
[4:49:20] heart_of_freljord: a lot of league player also play valorant so maybe not too much
[4:49:31] garden_grove: I still have a lot of fun playing league personally but I totally get why people don’t
[4:50:02] always_bet_jojo: 40 seems fare
[4:50:07] DialogueNPC: 40% of current playerbase
[4:50:16] brucebran: a large percent for sure, maybe around 15-20
[4:50:17] Kizeur: I think maybe only 30% of the players know what vanguard is and what it does. I dont even think all of them will quit
[4:50:21] brucebran: theres tons of closet cheaters in video games
[4:50:24] always_bet_jojo: no reason to have such an invasive program on your comp

[4:51:23] Kizeur: Bruh saying all cheaters is just delusional
[4:51:26] always_bet_jojo: but its alwasy on
