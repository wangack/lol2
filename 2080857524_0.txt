[2:09:32] tiagosoares230904: Good morning @MedicCasts how are you?
[2:09:33] migvelll: We gotta play the new amumu chroma of course
[2:10:30] tiagosoares230904: @Seishoon And the pulsefire? Isn't it really cool?
[2:10:57] GoldenGlobeRS: pulsefire ezreal needs update
[2:11:06] MIDNXGHT3: the blue chroma on battle academia ezreal is goated fr
[2:11:25] auri_sariel: hello Mr Medic!

[2:12:33] Nesgamer: I low key miss the elo system, it was simpler
[2:12:45] jaggler: classic
[2:13:10] Lullebulle123: having in game voice comms would help with that.
[2:13:19] MIDNXGHT3: this system is bad tho , ihave a friend who made emerald and trust me he should be stuck silver forever
[2:13:40] Nesgamer: its the same behind the scenes though right? Just feels different for dopamine hits?
[2:13:56] Likalottalolly: Low masters stlil better than the cesspit of Emerald IV
[2:14:07] auri_sariel: @MIDNXGHT3 i honestly never saw difference between a silver and emerald player skill wise, just a person who played more rankeds
[2:14:23] Theodomi_: emerald is the worst elo hell to ever exist
[2:14:33] Theodomi_: and i should know, i was in d5 in the early days
[2:14:33] Seishoon: @tiagosoares230904 yess it is
[2:14:44] GoldenGlobeRS: LUL
[2:14:46] MIDNXGHT3: @auri_sariel true he played over 300 games

[2:16:50] StreamElements: Oh yes, please give me subby wubbies, feels yummy in my tummy.
[2:17:21] Lullebulle123: KEKWtoxicity in voice comms is a poor argument as the tools to deal with it already exists, mute them. Also Riot could port the tools they have in valorant to check reports and punish people who are toxic in voice chat.
[2:17:21] vildrea: can someone warn Garen that he have no item?

[4:04:03] marcmlyn: xdd
[4:04:11] itstotallyamber: @Seishoon Save yourself
[4:04:40] Azlann_: @Seishoon prolly a bad idea rn, esports is strugglin rn
[4:05:46] Seishoon: hmm....maybe you're right but i still love the idea
[4:06:05] itstotallyamber: Maybe it's not so bad in a couple of years but yeah generally it's a very unstable market and causes a LOT of stress/burnout
[4:06:35] Seishoon: i spend a looooott of time on studying all sorts of stuff about league
[4:06:37] itstotallyamber: If it's something you're really interested in and don't mind investing the time and such then you do you
[4:07:57] Seishoon: i would also like going pro in league but i need some more practice for that..
[4:08:16] remixlol1: Wanna get into esports? Play 24/7
[4:08:21] remixlol1: Do not follow any advice i give.
[4:08:29] Seishoon: XD
[4:08:29] itstotallyamber: lul
[4:09:09] Azlann_: @Seishoon if you love the idea, thats definitely a base necessity so if u wanna go for it, just make sure you've got things specified and probably also make sure ur ur financially able to with some money saved up for expenses
[4:09:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[4:09:46] Seishoon: odds are against me for becoming pro anyway (i play adc with unstable-ish ping and solo) XD

[4:11:50] Azlann_: imma be real with you man, going pro is nearly impossible; u really have to be the best of the best. the amount of discipline and perserverance u need to get good enough to get to that level is insane so be ready to suffer lol

[4:16:34] Azlann_: @Seishoon thats great bro, but pretty good isn't good enough for pro play though, same with macro; macro is even more important as well. and yes better internet would be nice lol; so go get a part time job so u can pay for better internet u feel me?
[4:16:50] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[4:17:02] Azlann_: OOF they left u for dead there bud
[4:17:06] Azlann_: feelsbad
[4:17:19] Azlann_: ah

[4:20:24] Seishoon: @Azlann_ nah internet issue is not being able to pay for better internet it's the area where i live

[4:25:11] Azlann_: also if ur squishy, he can kill you within the span of the stun with his autos btw
[4:25:12] Azlann_: XD
[4:25:44] Just_Skyr: if he play adc u dont have any counter play as adc vs him
[4:26:04] itstotallyamber: OKAY
[4:26:25] Azlann_: the scary thing about ad TF is that he makes his Auto range a large threat
[4:26:33] Azlann_: so u have to constantly be aware of his range
[4:26:38] Azlann_: if ur not u die
[4:26:52] itstotallyamber: RUN
[4:27:25] Azlann_: but u can outrange him and if ur kiting is good u can space him out
[4:27:33] Azlann_: Senna is a good counter cuz of that
[4:27:41] Azlann_: not only cuz she can outrange him
[4:27:44] TheK10S: Hola medic. How's life treating you?
[4:28:00] Azlann_: Her E also makes it so that she can't be autod when he has RFC up for example
[4:28:31] Azlann_: oh wtf
[4:28:51] Azlann_: so much magic dmg yeah
[4:28:52] itstotallyamber: YEP

[4:29:36] TheK10S: constantly stacking 100
[4:30:09] Azlann_: @TheK10S its called trailblazer, it works like deadmans  but a support item that leaves a trail that speeds up allys
[4:31:13] Just_Skyr: i remember then KS did true dmg on 3 shot, that was ont fun
[4:31:21] TheK10S: I remember when games regularly used to be 45-50 mins.

[6:49:39] itstotallyamber: I dare not ask what the mattress actual cost
[6:49:44] Odyssey1989: ngl GIGAMEDIC is one of my new favorite emotes
[6:49:44] lec_airport_speedrun: You should write a book, maybe call it "The art of the deal"
[6:49:47] Vepziidoo: Thats great. Our matress shrunk like 20cm and all we got was a regular refund
[6:50:06] lec_airport_speedrun: Yeah, MAD into LGD I think?
[6:50:30] lec_airport_speedrun: And nip most recently
[6:51:09] Odyssey1989: @itstotallyamber Good matresses are expensive, my king was £1300, most expensive piece of furnature I own
[6:51:22] itstotallyamber: Sheeeesh
[6:51:26] itstotallyamber: That is a king though
[6:51:36] itstotallyamber: And yeah it's an investment
[6:51:38] Odyssey1989: But also you spend almost 40% of your entire life in your bed
[6:52:02] Odyssey1989: So #worth
[6:52:17] fliipsy: @Odyssey1989 why so little? 60% sounds so much more comfy :3
[6:52:48] Odyssey1989: @fliipsy I almost went with 50% but worried people would call me lazy xdd
[6:52:50] itstotallyamber: I've defo spent more than 40% in bed on average
[6:53:20] itstotallyamber: She eepy perma
[6:53:29] fliipsy: I just slept for 13 hrs last night.. and already feel like a nap again... I am in no position to call anyone lazy xD
[6:53:46] Odyssey1989: Well I spend an average of 7 hours asleep a night but I'm normally in bed a good half hour/hour before sleep so 8 hours a day
[6:53:50] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord

[6:58:59] Odyssey1989: All he needs to stop being toxic is a bit of time with Medic
[6:59:15] itstotallyamber: X to doubt
[6:59:27] lec_airport_speedrun: Seen as you have remix here, can you ask him about the masochist allegations

[7:11:35] Laragon: feels like game lost either way. Fight was the better chance to not lose
[7:11:46] Balmark: think shen threw his ulti out of the pram with his toys earlier
[7:11:57] DrizztDoUrden69: bruh
[7:12:06] DrizztDoUrden69: i love league

[7:16:50] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[7:17:04] Vepziidoo: If I was Lee I would be malding
[7:17:30] itstotallyamber: HAHAHAAHHAHA

[7:18:05] itstotallyamber: Let's hope
[7:18:29] lec_airport_speedrun: Clearly rito gaem have implemented their new rating system and it's decided that you weren't at fault for that game
[7:18:40] lec_airport_speedrun: And, in fact, you did well
[7:19:26] LuxarrF: focus on improve... this guy in your voice is so smart
[7:19:29] itstotallyamber: Faaaaaaaaack
[7:19:43] lec_airport_speedrun: Holy fuck, we've found number 1 remix fan
[7:20:02] auri_sariel: medic in a way u can brag that ure master finally @MedicCasts KEKW

[7:20:24] itstotallyamber: RIOT
[7:20:51] remixlol1: xdd
[7:20:55] Odyssey1989: You played too good Medic your MMR went up

[7:21:18] Odyssey1989: LP down MMR up
[7:21:21] Odyssey1989: RIOT
[7:21:23] lec_airport_speedrun: How much do you de-rank between splits these days, I forget
[7:21:30] remixlol1: I snipe you np
[7:21:36] abgewaschen_: just uninstall the app
[7:21:37] itstotallyamber: I tried looking for that on desktop but couldn't find it
[7:21:39] lec_airport_speedrun: Too late, I called zem and got her IP
[7:21:42] swoopske: being high elo is a solitary path
[7:21:52] abgewaschen_: @itstotallyamber its the app only
[7:21:58] itstotallyamber: Okay good
[7:22:01] TheK10S: Remix is cursed. I have never seen you win with him.
[7:22:13] Balmark: uninstalling twitter/x is the fix
[7:22:13] remixlol1: Turned it off, ty
[7:22:31] remixlol1: @TheK10S Im just too bad :(
[7:22:40] MorenOZZ: Bro soloq is so piss boring at some point
[7:22:59] auri_sariel: @MedicCasts at one point u gotta ask urself if the master rank is worth it not playing with friends
[7:23:08] remixlol1: I still hope the roumors that they bring back duoq master + is true
[7:23:09] Kacnea: i duo'd to master with a friend last year, but once we hit masters we got so demotivated to play more because we have to play alone (also doesnt help we played duo bot)
[7:23:09] TheK10S: @remixlol1 You need to go on a spiritual journey through the himalayas to get rid of the curse
[7:23:10] remixlol1: and then we go high medic
[7:23:22] swoopske: ...and your chat
[7:23:35] Aroumi: pls play with broxah

[7:23:52] Aroumi: he needs u, he's tilted
[7:23:52] Balmark: bragging rights vs other casters when on the desk :P
[7:24:28] auri_sariel: challengers have it easy, they are basically playing with friends in almost every ranked
[7:24:30] CynnieBun: hi medic!
[7:25:02] Asuralol: Remember these are 9 people that came to ruín your day
[7:25:21] Laragon: Wow, this does look like a giga draft gap
[7:25:21] swoopske: ... and how to mildly flame people :P
[7:25:34] auri_sariel: i loved Caedrels casting, entertaining af KEKW
[7:25:35] lec_airport_speedrun: Did you just insult caedrel
[7:25:49] TheK10S: Won game unless your GP or Graves gets tilted. That's always the loss con.
[7:25:52] remixlol1: TF runes?XD
[7:25:54] Laragon: maybe their monitors shut off
[7:25:57] Museus7: @MedicCasts I did a crossword last night that the clue was "tendon" and the answer was "tissue" please explain
[7:25:57] abgewaschen_: weird song
[7:26:04] lec_airport_speedrun: I'll have you know caedrel is the greatest caster of all time and the greatest there will ever be you aren't allowed to say anything against him how dare you
[7:26:06] Vepziidoo: Doesnt Tf rush Kraken anymore?
[7:26:13] auri_sariel: i mean, that kassadin should 1v9 this match in late game
[7:26:16] lec_airport_speedrun: Especially you and your iron4 ass
[7:26:46] Laragon: but we can have COPIUM
[7:26:51] Museus7: Why would that be the answer though, do tendons not have specific names
[7:26:52] Iolpie: a little sussy invade
[7:26:53] Odyssey1989: No more mixdic stream
[7:26:56] itstotallyamber: NOPERS no hope
[7:26:57] TheK10S: You got rid of the curse xD
[7:26:59] Odyssey1989: Sadge
[7:27:08] remixlol1: What if we just go flexQ rank 1
[7:27:11] Laragon: Sadge I like breaking rules though
[7:27:12] Asuralol: Stream snipers WutFace
[7:27:13] auri_sariel: @Iolpie i mean they got a summ out of medics bot lane, worth it
[7:28:09] Odyssey1989: @Museus7 Was it a Cryptic? I hate them, it's just an excuse to have shit clues
[7:28:26] Museus7: @Odyssey1989 No it was just a normal ass crossword, I'm too bad at crosswords to do anything special
[7:29:26] auri_sariel: 3 flashes in a 1 for 1 trade.. uhh not sure bout that
[7:29:51] auri_sariel: yes yes, true, that lost the game, its over
[7:30:23] Museus7: What's your opinion on per-key pings vs click-and-drag
[7:30:29] itstotallyamber: This is an interesting cover, love how 'moody' it is
[7:30:42] Kacnea: HUH
[7:30:52] auri_sariel: @Museus7 if u get used to fast click and drag its better
[7:31:07] TheK10S: I thought you ran ghost on maokai sup now
[7:31:11] Odyssey1989: Leash crab for graves?
[7:31:13] Laragon: warded and retreat are my only on-key pings
[7:31:56] TheK10S: Not to mention.. flash maokai support lost a couple of games on this strem today
[7:32:01] Odyssey1989: YUUUUGE
[7:32:02] auri_sariel: bruh when u sneeze so hard even ur lungs are aching after it
[7:32:11] Museus7: @itstotallyamber reminded me of the "Happy Together" cover by Filter
[7:32:13] Odyssey1989: @auri_sariel Bless you
[7:32:26] itstotallyamber: Oh? I don't think I know that one

[7:33:05] itstotallyamber: Ahhhh
[7:33:17] Odyssey1989: @auri_sariel Interesting factoid, Bless you is a thing because they used to think you sneezed out your soul and a demon could possess you if you weren't blessed
[7:33:48] auri_sariel: @Odyssey1989 thats honestly pretty funny, had no idea bout that
[7:33:49] Laragon: SMOrc the rift demands blood
[7:33:49] TaintedTitan: 1k channel points
[7:33:53] TaintedTitan: 9k for song request bb
[7:34:46] Odyssey1989: @auri_sariel Figured people in Medic chat would appreciate little factoids
[7:34:48] TaintedTitan: oh that's pressure, something ot match the vibe
[7:34:49] TheK10S: Are maokai saplings like little kids he creates?
[7:35:07] fliipsy: @TheK10S nah, they are from the branch family
[7:35:10] auri_sariel: @TheK10S i would call it his poop that is alive
[7:35:17] Odyssey1989: @fliipsy xdd

[7:35:27] itstotallyamber: Okay that Filter cover slaps

[7:35:37] TaintedTitan: do people wanna hear something in Maltese?
[7:35:47] itstotallyamber: Sure?
[7:35:50] Asuralol: Skin moles
[7:35:51] Balmark: vayne freefarming will never become a problem ;)

[7:38:56] TheK10S: Malignance good on kassa? Does he really need ultimate haste?
[7:39:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.

[7:41:31] Odyssey1989: and you said
[7:41:45] Odyssey1989: medicFear
[7:41:58] Odyssey1989: He laughed to be fair
[7:42:09] TheK10S: What was the comment?
[7:42:38] auri_sariel: bruh is he pretending to be the clone? XD
[7:42:39] Odyssey1989: @TheK10S If Guldborg played Shyvana like this he'd probably have an easier time climbing"
[7:43:30] auri_sariel: oh, Ahri has malignance, she solo lost the match for her team
[7:43:36] auri_sariel: with that choice alone
[7:44:33] TheK10S: Lulu out warding you
[7:45:01] tobertet: Hey @MedicCasts what do you think about buffing void grubs by making each of them reduce the recall time 0.5 for the whole team?
[7:46:12] auri_sariel: @MedicCasts IWDominate said having 6 grubs is gamebreakingly strong, that even if ure far behind you can win one teamfight and u will win the match of the grubs alone
[7:46:20] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted
[7:46:21] tac0w0: Medic still going strong? DAMN
[7:46:29] TheK10S: @tobertet 3 second reduced recall for the whole game would be OP beyond measure
[7:46:36] itstotallyamber: Well, he's still going
[7:46:50] StreamElements: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.
[7:46:50] tac0w0: strong is another question? yikes
[7:47:16] itstotallyamber: He's playing strong, his teammates however
[7:47:28] TheK10S: Why 6? i thought 5 was the breaking point.. where you start spawning the tiny little cuty pituties.
[7:47:39] tac0w0: 2 > 1
[7:47:43] auri_sariel: i think grubs are fine as they are rn maybe even nerf the numbers on the true DoT to the tower
[7:48:14] auri_sariel: seeing sometimes like 700 true damage dealt to a tower in a single push sometimes looks too big

[7:52:26] TaintedTitan: @Balmark not really, the double on hit isnt that useful, and there better in slot items for attack speed/on hit
[7:52:34] TheK10S: Yeah they need to nerf TF adc. He does too much damage, has  a point and click stun, gets more gold than all other adcs, and has a free TP every couple of minutes....
[7:52:55] auri_sariel: @TheK10S he is getting AD nerfs on 14.5

[7:54:16] TaintedTitan: @Balmark stuff like terminus, stormrazor are better
[7:54:19] auri_sariel: @MedicCasts will LEC play on 14.5 this weekend or still 14.4?
[7:54:20] tac0w0: are you sure amba?
[7:54:22] TheK10S: Don't go behind jax after you push him, he will always just use you to jump out.

[7:55:22] embryage: nah i like feel like i tear, i just like wake up and then the pain just coming right up

[8:05:50] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[8:05:52] Airfire: My understanding is that the reason that LP was even implemented is because it felt 'bad' to win a game but lose MMR. It might be because you're winning at your current rank, you're 'affirming' your MMR meaning it's going down but LP is going up

[8:11:03] alyushacb: ChokingTheLifeOutOfThisDamnCat
[8:11:18] auri_sariel: @wollfwing the real issue was APA betting on C9 and intentionally losing KEKW
[8:11:19] itstotallyamber: That emote lmfao
[8:11:28] TheK10S: Your last smolder had 190 stacks in 20 mins

[8:16:53] TheK10S: I started reading midnight's children.
[8:17:16] itstotallyamber: Children of Time I believe he said
[8:17:27] auri_sariel: @Faithful_v6 Children of Time by adrian tchaikovski
[8:17:38] Museus7: If anybody's looking for a nice short book (around 200 pages) "This Is How You Lose the Time War" is 11/10
[8:17:52] itstotallyamber: catJAM
[8:18:17] TheK10S: good movement by milio

[8:20:47] auri_sariel: @TheK10S bruh we had the same idea XD
[8:21:17] inFinem__: asking for smolder or senna stacks has the same vibe as "are we there yet" on a car trip KEKW
[8:21:20] StockingAnarchy9: @MedicCasts  quick question why Q max first, instead of W max

[8:23:22] Kurbee_: @StockingAnarchy9 W is a super telegraphed gap closer. Q is, as medic said, max health %, provides CC in an AOE and doesnt make you fly under turret or deep. Its a more reliable ability to max.
[8:23:50] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[8:24:43] TheK10S: Please do another smolder stack check at 20 mins

[8:56:38] TheK10S: Let that innocent little tf abuser be..
[8:56:52] CrowSWE: @auri_sariel What are the nerfs again? E attack speed reduction or smth?

[9:00:18] itsmaffs: got it!
[9:00:21] itstotallyamber: Nice
[9:00:31] CrowSWE: @auri_sariel idk tbh I feel like just the W stun and the fact that he gets extra gold for every minion will still be strong

[9:01:19] itstotallyamber: @mrpedroson you about?
[9:01:23] auri_sariel: @CrowSWE i mean that AS and  damage is the biggest attraction, i think this nerfs are too huge to keep going with AD TF
