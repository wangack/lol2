[1:39:08] yutipa: @spicyricegg if u wanna play kayle just go varus top lol
[1:39:13] spicyricegg: @KolerMaister yea keep playing like i did then u learn how to get out of laning, eventually u get it
[1:39:14] league_of_d3pression: @spicyricegg she wins almost any matchup late, the hard part is trying to farm early and scale lol
[1:39:19] Luufiy: @Zahovay i get to the inhib and take it but somehow my team is still fck it ***ey randomly farm the jungle instead do anything
[1:39:39] Zahovay: Yeah well you cannot carry every game @Luufiy
[1:39:40] AgahAlperEfendi: abi trundle ye √ßok benziyrsun mk
[1:39:49] spicyricegg: yea the only thing u need to learn is how to get out of laning
[1:39:54] KolerMaister: @spicyricegg i watch the best kayle world atm , but i dont feel i can play like him. its like imposible to dodge everything and have this macro, when u get 16 game is diff
[1:39:58] KolerMaister: but lane phase is like..
[1:40:13] yutipa: @KolerMaister ur opponents arent chall either

[1:41:59] yutipa: @KolerMaister till like diamond u win lane by just normal wave management and kayle is fine going like 10-15 cs down by lvl 6 which is like not that hard unless vs darius renekton
[1:42:34] spicyricegg: fk this makes me wanna play kayle now lol\
[1:42:35] yutipa: @KolerMaister but again whoever feels like playing kayle after lt nerfs is a psycho so
[1:42:46] KolerMaister: @yutipa ok lets slow it down. imagine i try NOT feed 1st of all..when ur team is not good or not the winning side, they go mental go araming they dont make time for u to scale and so on.. how u win that xD
[1:42:57] KolerMaister: what nerfs

[1:44:40] saijaxwashere: full armor urgpt omegalul
[1:44:47] KolerMaister: @yutipa best kayles world dont plays with lethal tempo, they does only with ad , with ap they go fleet mostly for survive lane and win after
[1:44:49] VTVtheNousagi: @KolerMaister just split til 16, you can maybe draw them back and your team have more room to fight. if they still lose, its an ff angle
[1:44:59] DoveJames: who‚Äôs this good looking man!? PogChamp boxFlower
[1:45:07] Luufiy: @KolerMaister 1vs9 i imposibble even challenger players lose in bronze games
[1:45:12] yutipa: @KolerMaister its crucial to understand that just "not loosing to hard" is not a way to climb because that means u personally have no say in how the game goes since you are just starting behind and you will stay behind unless your opponent is A LOT worse than you. just how game works
