[1:38:19] spicyricegg: @KolerMaister kayle is goated. i spammed over 100 games only kayle to learn matchups etc & her carry potential is insane
[1:38:33] spicyricegg: once had a 1v5 penta defending my base lmfao
[1:38:42] Aldoz: Giant enemy spider
[1:38:44] KolerMaister: @spicyricegg i knoiw...but i feel everytime i loose its like..its my fault
[1:38:49] KolerMaister: coz i dont know lane
[1:39:05] Beyond_Desolation2: @spicyricegg i almost had one with jinxs, the closest i got to 1x5 penta LUL
[1:39:08] yutipa: @spicyricegg if u wanna play kayle just go varus top lol
[1:39:13] spicyricegg: @KolerMaister yea keep playing like i did then u learn how to get out of laning, eventually u get it
[1:39:14] league_of_d3pression: @spicyricegg she wins almost any matchup late, the hard part is trying to farm early and scale lol
[1:39:19] Luufiy: @Zahovay i get to the inhib and take it but somehow my team is still fck it ***ey randomly farm the jungle instead do anything
[1:39:39] Zahovay: Yeah well you cannot carry every game @Luufiy
[1:39:40] AgahAlperEfendi: abi trundle ye çok benziyrsun mk
[1:39:49] spicyricegg: yea the only thing u need to learn is how to get out of laning
[1:39:54] KolerMaister: @spicyricegg i watch the best kayle world atm , but i dont feel i can play like him. its like imposible to dodge everything and have this macro, when u get 16 game is diff
[1:39:58] KolerMaister: but lane phase is like..

[1:41:55] Skynee: 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️ 🖱️
[1:41:59] yutipa: @KolerMaister till like diamond u win lane by just normal wave management and kayle is fine going like 10-15 cs down by lvl 6 which is like not that hard unless vs darius renekton
[1:42:34] spicyricegg: fk this makes me wanna play kayle now lol\
[1:42:35] yutipa: @KolerMaister but again whoever feels like playing kayle after lt nerfs is a psycho so
[1:42:46] KolerMaister: @yutipa ok lets slow it down. imagine i try NOT feed 1st of all..when ur team is not good or not the winning side, they go mental go araming they dont make time for u to scale and so on.. how u win that xD
[1:42:57] KolerMaister: what nerfs

[1:44:09] KolerMaister: @Luufiy well most of games goign like that..so i need get out of that and having also lane winning sometimes so i can 1v9 faster
[1:44:10] Vintyx: Nice
[1:44:11] 123456789azertyyy: 1v2 god
[1:44:13] saberdonk: Outplayed

[1:44:40] saijaxwashere: full armor urgpt omegalul
[1:44:47] KolerMaister: @yutipa best kayles world dont plays with lethal tempo, they does only with ad , with ap they go fleet mostly for survive lane and win after
[1:44:49] VTVtheNousagi: @KolerMaister just split til 16, you can maybe draw them back and your team have more room to fight. if they still lose, its an ff angle
[1:44:59] DoveJames: who’s this good looking man!? PogChamp boxFlower
[1:45:07] Luufiy: @KolerMaister 1vs9 i imposibble even challenger players lose in bronze games
[1:45:12] yutipa: @KolerMaister its crucial to understand that just "not loosing to hard" is not a way to climb because that means u personally have no say in how the game goes since you are just starting behind and you will stay behind unless your opponent is A LOT worse than you. just how game works
