[1:45:48] Bazeloth: Breathe Santorin, breathe
[1:46:00] ChicoLoLxD: @Oblivixn1999 oh lmao
[1:46:01] waynekerrishere: This is why I stay iron, Bronze players are the worse
[1:46:19] Oblivixn1999: @waynekerrishere xdd
[1:47:07] Bazeloth: Im paired with gold players in my matches and im bronze. He was telling me what to do over and over. Ended with more kills/cs and objectives than him
[1:48:06] alabamahammer02: All i know is Kaenic Rookern is the best item in the game!
[1:49:37] alabamahammer02: yea, it used to pretty much negate AP players
[1:49:42] alabamahammer02: but still strong on tanks
[1:50:13] Amorello: Blame the junglers!!!
[1:50:32] Bazeloth: Jinx themesong POGGERS
[1:50:52] DallinS: kha feels pretty horrible to play against
[1:50:58] alabamahammer02: Do you always morph the same abilities for Kha?
[1:51:38] Jamanna: ive watched the last 5 streams now and you never ever lose jungle, pretty insane ;D
[1:51:38] turnsgreene: opportunity over ghostblade now?
[1:52:09] alabamahammer02: cait is so disgusting
[1:52:26] alabamahammer02: DELETED
[1:52:45] Bazeloth: They just cant wait
[1:52:47] Amorello: Losers queue confirmed
[1:52:47] alabamahammer02: Cait has to reinstall the client after that deletion
[1:54:28] Amorello: Hahaha
[1:57:11] nuky_999: Whenever I see you play kha you get shit team
[1:57:30] Amorello: Thought I turned in to a Santorin stream. Instead I get to watch teletubbies, 10/10 content
[1:57:50] bunses: go edge
[1:59:58] iiNumb3rz: Solo q is fun. I did 85k damage on eve and lost a 35 min game with 25 kills kekw. Good job 46 death bot lane.
[2:00:08] Broitone: nothing like watching teletubbies in the morning
[2:00:14] iiNumb3rz: Like that has to be reportable right?
[2:00:26] iiNumb3rz: iiNumb3rz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:01:09] NachoLazer_: I mean isnt it also up to the jngler, to let some of the kills go to the team? If you only have ONE fed teammate, it's just an auto loss, because they just 5v1 the fed guy and the
[2:01:09] Broitone: wait wuttt numb3rz just subbed the other day??
[2:01:21] NachoLazer_: *then slaugthers the rest of the team
[2:01:21] Ploxer: can u check how janna got to 200hp lvl 1
[2:01:33] iiNumb3rz: I thought so too. Then I just got ads. Twitch be wild
[2:01:33] shadow7master: 10/3 on nid and 7/3 kha still lost Sadge
[2:01:40] ancientnooodle: @NachoLazer_ not when you play assassins
[2:01:50] Broitone: @iiNumb3rz unlucky. now you get two shoutoutes :D
[2:01:56] iiNumb3rz: If you said anything about my eve gsme I didn't hear it because twitch decided to make me watch ads kekw
[2:01:59] Ace_strup: gm, hope everyone has a wonderful week!
[2:02:17] Ploxer: xdd bot got ahead but wanted to throw it away cause they got impatient
[2:02:31] shadow7master: @iiNumb3rz reload
[2:02:41] NachoLazer_: Ah I see. It makes sense, it's just something i often see in my teletubbie elo
[2:02:51] milkweed_love: better winrate on random champs, time to go back to ornn jg
[2:02:59] iiNumb3rz: It's so hard for me to trust my team with gold. They're like a high mateninence relationship lol.
[2:03:12] i_hit_u_quit: corejj griefing haha
[2:03:51] Bazeloth: isnt 50% the target ratio?
[2:04:20] iiNumb3rz: 50% target ratio would be good if I didn't lose 27 and gain 22
[2:04:21] Bazeloth: I mean its been what, 14 years now? I think theyre doing great
[2:04:22] giroxeplug: lulu jungle is that a hing????? i saw spica player herr???
[2:04:50] iiNumb3rz: Spica wild bro.
[2:05:04] iiNumb3rz: Skipped yuumi though kekw
[2:05:08] getsometalentloser: @santorin  can I send the video link
[2:05:18] Santorin: !permit getsometalentloser
[2:05:19] Nightbot: @Santorin -> getsometalentloser has been granted permission to post a link for 60 seconds.
[2:05:19] Social_Phobia: oh did you play hwei jungle? :D
[2:05:29] milkweed_love: do you think GGs and EG backed out in part because of the player strike? makes their investment that much riskier
[2:05:51] getsometalentloser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQZ8zCGFtU0&t=1134s
[2:06:03] Amorello: Tbf he did throw hard af in the game that Tyler raged at haha
[2:06:12] iiNumb3rz: To be fair I couldn't be on tylers team. I couldn't play with him critiquing my every mistake.
[2:06:48] Amorello: The flame isn't justified but core did run it down haha
[2:07:09] iiNumb3rz: If you're 1/3 you should be flaming people
[2:08:17] Amorello: Yeh also it's not like Tyler is a title proof player
[2:08:20] Amorello: *tilt
[2:08:55] hazygreys: i couldnt even tell you what belveth passive is tbh
[2:09:52] Amorello: Nice play
[2:10:32] ChronicallyBlazed: every time i see a galio i have nightmares about when he could flash while channeling taunt
[2:10:41] capslockalwayson: bel veth is one of the champions in all of league of legends
[2:10:45] Ashura__Oni: Good day
[2:10:50] ScoobiSnax: a game with even one friendly tank and you have a way better early game, shocker
[2:11:43] bunses: and they died 2v1 xd
[2:11:58] bunses: its so sad
[2:12:14] GideonBast: oh nice do we normally see Hwei bot at this Elo?
[2:13:02] Bazeloth: Well then
[2:13:48] RaiohKyros: sup sup
[2:13:57] RaiohKyros: are we done with all champs
[2:14:08] 0reosandmilk: Inting yasuo ftw
[2:14:23] shadow7master: yasuo going for the 0/10 spike
[2:14:54] Ploxer: what does panth support do, havent played in a while
[2:15:06] Amorello: Back in winners queue
[2:15:09] 0reosandmilk: Stun and spear throw rly
[2:15:48] 0reosandmilk: How is Yas in this elo? Lol
[2:15:49] lairdd2: Your bot lane is doing fine
[2:16:41] getsometalentloser: o it’s player maker Zac
[2:17:17] noonifer: Nice dive Cleanshavetorin
[2:17:24] getsometalentloser: can u click on zac
[2:21:28] getsometalentloser: it’s a bit late now wanted to@see if he had passive during the dive
[2:23:00] ImRegent: @getsometalentloser he did i saw the icon on his name during it
[2:25:30] Praetor_GG: BigBrother
[2:26:16] LtBasti: why do people like Tyler again?
[2:26:18] The_Posh_Panda: corejj was running it down hard that game though, not as bad as niles in that one game though
[2:27:02] DallinS: just followed your voli build and thrashed
[2:27:06] Social_Phobia: @LtBasti ive been asking myself the exact same question tbh
[2:27:34] hazygreys: can we just talk about the irony of T1 complaining about people running it down?
[2:27:36] Praetor_GG: he's entertaining af
[2:27:41] GideonBast: idk about that in other countries do you get death threats in 19/20 games if you die a single time in the first 5 minutes? cause that’s NA
[2:28:20] Praetor_GG: other streamers ban people for typing at them, tyler1 gets 30k viewers 1/3 of them flaming him in chat
[2:28:55] Praetor_GG: @GideonBast if you're getting flamed that bad you're doing something, or lying, or need to turn chat off ok
[2:29:00] rexxarhero4: his delivery is extreme but there is truth in what he says
[2:29:22] Jukester_lol: He is a personality for the camera for sure I feel, he has prolly grown up alot since his really toxic days
[2:30:34] Praetor_GG: even in videos from 7 years ago, you can see a clear character he's playing, but like a good entertainer it's a played up version of himself
[2:30:54] ChronicallyBlazed: is there special treatment for tyler? I feel like I'd get perma banned if I typed what he types in game
[2:31:05] GideonBast: @praetor_gg an exaggeration obv but that’s how serious the game is taken. it’s never just in game stuff escalates like crazy, and I don’t see that at all in other regions
[2:31:13] Praetor_GG: he's been chat banned over the years man
[2:31:29] Jukester_lol: I would respect them more, if half of them didnt behave like 4 years olds  KEKW
[2:31:35] Praetor_GG: @GideonBast I've seen it in EUW and KR on stream, just diff languages ok
[2:32:13] Praetor_GG: @GideonBast also low elo is way worse for some reason
[2:32:15] LtBasti: idk if they banned the bauss. they can ban anyone lol. no one is safe
[2:32:57] ChronicallyBlazed: baus was perma'd but got it back on appeal right?
[2:33:02] LtBasti: ^
[2:33:08] GideonBast: @praetor_gg 100% higher elo they have way more people who turn off chat. Yeah  floating around emerald man people are oof
[2:33:39] getsometalentloser: did u watch the phreak video
[2:33:43] Kai0Shin05: goodevening hotguy6pack
[2:33:51] bunses: yeah like Ratirl has 30+ acc.
[2:33:56] LtBasti: wait can riot tell people they can’t stream league?
[2:33:58] DallinS: there's a guy streaming rn that's playing multiple games at once and running it down on all of them
[2:34:02] Praetor_GG: @GideonBast idk about higher elo because chat might have useful info, but I turn off in plat on my new account because nothing worthwhile
[2:34:14] getsometalentloser: lol community has an issue with thinking for themselves
[2:34:20] The_Posh_Panda: i guess, but no one calls out when corejj and niles are being toxic via gameplay in game
[2:34:21] Ploxer: community is too far gone to fix
[2:34:33] GideonBast: sooo true, the casual toxicity in his every breath makes it seem natural
[2:34:39] SpottedGiraffes: I watch you and it makes me become a positive player!
[2:34:48] Praetor_GG: @The_Posh_Panda same thing happened in HotS "toxicity" only applied to words, not gameplay
[2:35:06] shadow7master: ppl now r too lazy to think or be themselvs they want to copy everything
[2:35:10] laxidamius: Because they're a bunch of sheep
[2:35:14] The_Posh_Panda: @Praetor_GG ya, its like only reprimanding the person who hit 2nd.
[2:35:16] Praetor_GG: a pro player stomping you is a premium way to learn
[2:35:24] ntmadeit: hello hello
[2:35:44] GideonBast: creative gamer rage is so funny and enjoyable. That is quality banter
[2:35:48] Praetor_GG: S OMEGALUL BAD
[2:36:05] razercup: I personally feel that jg mains have it the worst in terms of getting flamed
[2:36:12] Ploxer: can riot put the bait ping back in game, i miss using it in tft :(
[2:36:15] Praetor_GG: keeping your own ego in check is a skill in this game
[2:36:44] getsometalentloser: @razercup  many laners can’t accept they got clapped in lane or made a mistake
[2:37:39] GideonBast: @santorin what do you think of the all supports suck mentality ?
[2:37:41] TheQuackleDK: How far would you be able to climb if you played only adc/bot lane?
[2:38:01] noonifer: Or /Fullmute all as soon as you get into game and pretend their npcs
[2:38:05] Magnarius: well that is true cause I got flamed as a Adc cause the top forgot to say that the guy came gank me 5 time bot and he was saying I suck at the game ... so it is true that people tunnel hard and insult easily
[2:38:22] Praetor_GG: chat is a minigame I don't need to play, when I get to the elo where people time flashes I'll re-enable
[2:38:22] Xplizzit: Heyyaaa How's my fav jungler doing?
[2:38:23] getsometalentloser: veigar v2 said the best
[2:38:30] getsometalentloser: it’s not jungle diff ur just fucking bad
[2:38:31] TheQuackleDK: I mean apc/adc
[2:38:43] razercup: @getsometalentloser thats so true, especially when you ping your team that enemy jungler is X lane and they still coinflip the push and die
[2:38:46] Praetor_GG: I do the same ok
[2:39:20] Xplizzit: Good! Me and my friend started fresh accounts, we have 87% winrate now in Emerald1 currently. We've gotten so much hate for smurfing. Thoughts?
[2:39:35] milkweed_love: I think emotes are the best thing League has added. I find myself looking for emote buttons in other games when I make flashy plays
[2:39:36] Praetor_GG: I don't suck I'm just limit testing Sadge pls gank bot Sadge
[2:39:37] GideonBast: it seems really common to just hate all support players if you main carry lol
[2:39:49] DallinS: Phreak was talking about putting more power into the JG! :)
[2:39:57] hazygreys: top thinks jungle broken, adc thinks top broken, jungle thinks supp broken lol
[2:40:07] getsometalentloser: cause support is completely op but but riot won’t nerf it
[2:40:25] getsometalentloser: cause they keep it open cause ppl won’t play it unless the role is broken
[2:40:36] Praetor_GG: shaco is really cheese to lane against
[2:40:37] GideonBast: fasting Senna got me E4 so easy this season it’s Op
[2:41:37] scubasteve932_: y you have so much hope for them -.-
[2:41:51] Praetor_GG: zeri pick means shaco and xayah just walk up and do free dmg
[2:42:02] milkweed_love: little fox lol
[2:42:15] GideonBast: what inspired the Teletubbies insult
[2:42:26] GideonBast: makes me laugh everytime
[2:42:42] Praetor_GG: support is broken and maokai is broken I'm playing them ok
[2:42:51] GideonBast: true
[2:42:54] getsometalentloser: support can impact whole map
[2:42:54] GideonBast: its wonderful
[2:42:57] getsometalentloser: with no consequences
[2:43:07] Praetor_GG: I'm playing zac support it's digusting
[2:43:14] GideonBast: I’m so happy to hear this haha
[2:43:39] Praetor_GG: I like giving vision too
[2:43:58] milkweed_love: supp income needs to be spread out over the game more. they get too much early and then fall off a cliff
[2:44:08] Praetor_GG: @milkweed_love agree
[2:44:16] getsometalentloser: fall off huh?
[2:44:19] Praetor_GG: and the dmg items need nerf
[2:44:24] getsometalentloser: bard will 1v1
[2:44:26] getsometalentloser: so many chanps
[2:44:28] Whitetigerr_: hey pops
[2:44:30] getsometalentloser: at all points
[2:44:41] Praetor_GG: that's bard LUL
[2:44:44] Whitetigerr_: FREE
[2:44:44] getsometalentloser: support camile which is disgusting as well
[2:44:51] Whitetigerr_: that shaco is so bad im better
[2:45:02] milkweed_love: need to give less $ per stack on supp item so it takes longer to complete
[2:45:06] Praetor_GG: if champ needs items, getting third+ can take a while
[2:45:13] Xplizzit: that was the maxest LeeSin Q range I've ever seen
[2:45:42] Praetor_GG: like once the support item is complete your back to mostly passive gold while team farms map
[2:46:32] Praetor_GG: NotLikeThis
[2:46:53] Domoles: Hello!
[2:47:03] milkweed_love: and if you stack supp item slower you get wards later and can't roam as early
[2:47:08] Praetor_GG: I go full tank with relentless hunter panzer build
[2:49:02] brightdiscord: hes chilling in the grave
[2:49:32] milkweed_love: small wolf is chilling
[2:49:38] pumsy1: fuyck you riot why does gragas have shut down with no kills oll
[2:50:51] ntmadeit: bro is dizzy
[2:51:19] bigbadfun4: lee sin is strong in this meta?
[2:51:54] pumsy1: is there some way to get better at skill shots?
[2:52:02] pumsy1: like lee sin q
[2:52:23] getsometalentloser: @pumsy1  some times u don’t need to throw it
[2:52:33] getsometalentloser: the enemy will juke themselves
[2:52:41] nwa4lifeTV: theres ai for that Kappa
[2:52:53] ntmadeit: league is the forgotten kid
[2:53:08] Oblivixn1999: you can add bots to the practice tool
[2:53:30] nwa4lifeTV: coz it eats into the server, they dont want us using their resources for practice tool
[2:54:18] nwa4lifeTV: you cannot argue with riots logic 5Head
[2:55:07] getsometalentloser: @santorin I’ve had a lot of success with Lee lately
[2:55:57] nwa4lifeTV: rip
[2:56:17] getsometalentloser: I just keep it simple and consistent why do u needed flashy shit
[2:56:38] Obeez: steelcaps deaths dance?
[2:56:39] nwa4lifeTV: adc sees farm he takes
[2:57:39] getsometalentloser: my eyess
[2:58:01] getsometalentloser: I have my suspicions regarding this zeri
[2:58:24] Obeez: true mercs looking way better
[2:58:34] getsometalentloser: !opgg
[2:58:34] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Santorini%20Panini-EUW & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/SantariniPanini-JGDIF & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ChatDisabler97-MUTE
[2:59:02] nwa4lifeTV: f for maokai
[2:59:13] pumsy1: lmfao.
[2:59:29] iiNumb3rz: Don't see too many fizz enjoyers in your games
[2:59:56] Praetor_GG: AlienDance
[3:00:24] nwa4lifeTV: ngl thought that was real
[3:01:22] iiNumb3rz: How do you decide whether to go eclipse or sundered first?
[3:01:32] iiNumb3rz: Of is just always one first?
[3:02:03] iiNumb3rz: That has to be one of the best names for an item. Sundered sky.
[3:02:15] iiNumb3rz: I dont remember what the ornn one is called but it's even better.
[3:02:24] Praetor_GG: Heavensfall
[3:02:26] nwa4lifeTV: xayah damage btw
[3:02:30] iiNumb3rz: Yep that's it.
[3:02:52] nwa4lifeTV: not for long, soon u will have death dance
[3:03:24] iiNumb3rz: Lmao the fizz pinged zeri off. He's a knower.
[3:03:31] Praetor_GG: adc picks weak early champ, gets tilted in lane, afk farms rest of game
[3:03:33] getsometalentloser: this zeri needs to be reported
[3:03:47] getsometalentloser: griefing jungle
[3:04:18] Praetor_GG: wp
[3:04:28] nwa4lifeTV: sundedsky heal btw
[3:04:55] iiNumb3rz: How do you gank a darius effectively? I always struggle due to his heal and bleed.
[3:05:10] iiNumb3rz: Even if me and laner have hp advantage
[3:05:19] Bazeloth: Is Nafaari jungle viable?
[3:05:28] ChicoLoLxD: did u say the xayah cleansed knockback on ur ult?
[3:05:35] ChicoLoLxD: didn’t know that was possible
[3:05:35] nwa4lifeTV: @iiNumb3rz dodge q and dont fight long time
[3:05:46] Oblivixn1999: @iiNumb3rz go before 6 and dodge the Q
[3:06:08] iiNumb3rz: I swear he's the hardest champ for me to gank.
[3:06:23] nwa4lifeTV: also depends on ur champ, coz u need to kite
[3:06:34] iiNumb3rz: Or a garen. But garen players just run away. It's a staple in the garen community I think.
[3:06:45] nwa4lifeTV: let garen engage first
[3:07:06] Ploxer: ok fizz good champ
[3:07:10] Post_Maclone: every time i check back in between meetgins this man is melting a nexus
[3:07:27] scubasteve932_: he play voli ??
[3:07:28] getsometalentloser: @santorin  did u watch the phreak video ?
[3:07:39] nwa4lifeTV: tyler1 monkaW
[3:07:54] iiNumb3rz: Dirty mousepad probably.
[3:07:57] Oblivixn1999: i played it when it came out and it was fun but not better than something like Talon or Kha
[3:08:09] iiNumb3rz: What kind of mouse do you use?
[3:08:56] Oblivixn1999: Naafiri jg is weird bc the dogs will tank so her clear is SUPER healthy, but you can't micro them so you can't pull camps either
[3:09:14] iiNumb3rz: I have the regular. Debating on superlite next. Mouse about a year old or so.
[3:09:26] Praetor_GG: PepeLaugh
[3:09:34] faakiecs: faker flaming in my iron games
[3:09:58] Post_Maclone: are we watching a video, about DL, VOD reviewing, T1's VOD?  what filthy LOL inception is this?
[3:10:02] TheQuackleDK: I feel so sorry for t1's coming child....Poor baby
[3:10:05] iiNumb3rz: I enjoy t1 but him calling anyone an inter is just the defention of irony.
[3:10:38] nwa4lifeTV: i wouldnt go after corejj coz man is a world champ
[3:10:39] solidussovis: he only does it so that there is people talking about him like they are now.
[3:10:47] BurritoTX: BurritoTX subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[3:11:04] iiNumb3rz: I was going to ask if you thought core would win trade but your reaction said everything I needed.
[3:11:08] alabamahammer02: That's just Tyler's schtick, he rages at everyone.
[3:11:35] BurritoTX: doing great.
[3:11:49] iiNumb3rz: Did you ever play against t1?
[3:12:08] Praetor_GG: nobody named Steinkamp is mean irl PepeLaugh
[3:12:09] louiecheese: just lost 45 LP🔥🔥🔥
[3:12:16] faakiecs: Even people says forgiven was cool in real life outside the game
[3:12:20] Trollo_Baggins: to be fair, having APA Azir as your only damage source could be considered wintrading
[3:12:36] iiNumb3rz: Is bjergsen still playing league? I wonder about him. I got into league watching you and him on tl
[3:12:36] Praetor_GG: KEKW
[3:12:39] Post_Maclone: I met T1 at Chicago LCS finals.  he stood in the rain to meet everyone waiting around for him in an unscheduled time.  he loves us.
[3:12:46] nwa4lifeTV: i remember last year when they nerfed it :)
[3:12:56] iiNumb3rz: It has nothing to do with your team being 0/5 before your first clear.
[3:13:02] stoicHolcan: i love re-learning my role every year only to get flamed by teammates dying 1v1 :)

[3:49:43] lolCrazyBear: What 3-5 junglers you recomand atm? I am kinda lost what to play
[3:50:00] lackmind9: Why do you need a game today?

[3:53:18] jashonnew: how do you feel about briar
[3:53:22] lolCrazyBear: Ty
[3:53:31] TheTrakker: brand peache70Elmo
[3:53:43] lackmind9: Really? I found Shyv to be weak right now. But I like AP bruiser.
[3:54:09] GideonBast: @santorin can Zyra jungle realistically yet?
[3:54:40] browy_eu: briar's r is literally a one-way ticket to int
[3:54:53] lackmind9: thanks!
[3:54:54] sebastianminiatures: that Shyvanna game was WILD
[3:55:30] getsometalentloser: @santorin  is kindred just better graves rn?
[3:55:54] rexxarhero4: the iron 4 reksai didnt notice the difference bro
[3:56:20] TheGodOfCakes: Man I just want them to revert the Rek'Sai ultimate. Give me back my global teleport!
[3:56:27] bigktelevision: graves got bad builds rn, he feels dependent on whether certain items are strong
[3:58:09] hillrammus: one thing about phreak he is open and informative about his balancing ideas
[3:59:08] GideonBast: it seems like they don’t have the champ balance team actually playing the game, they just don’t have a large enough team. They need analytics team, concept/implementation team, then a playtest team. The triforce is needed but they only have 1/3
[3:59:11] Bazeloth: Rek'Sai r was fear inspiring before the rework. Right now its just a diving ability that deals no damage. I mean his passive pretty much does nothing right now. Before his rework you had to get rid of the tunnels, right now you can leave them.
[4:00:11] TheTrakker: misgendering rek'sai smh my head Kappa
[4:00:19] DragonlyfLoL: the ingenious hunter trick w. voli and the healing/shielding items looks insane
[4:00:35] bigktelevision: took 10 months to nerf 53+% wr eve.
[4:00:37] GideonBast: yeah that’s why I said the team is just not big enough and isn’t broken into categories so everyone is doing everything
[4:00:38] ftUncleDrew: your w mark goes through Jax E btw @santorin
[4:00:38] Bazeloth: Not my first in 2024 @TheTrakker LUL
[4:01:30] Bazeloth: What do you think about Rek'Sai's passive right now? @Santorin
[4:01:32] Velraptured: Mark applies damage doesn't
[4:01:32] Norie_____: Idk why they don't break the game up and balance it depending on ELO, similar to how they scale / balance ARAM in comparison to the rift
[4:01:35] lackmind9: Should go through since it's an ability
[4:01:43] ftUncleDrew: it’s real, the dmg doesn’t go through but the mark applies! @santorin
[4:01:47] iiNumb3rz: Buff Bek veth please
[4:01:58] rexxarhero4: phreak said in a podcast hes going to adress lvl 1 cheese invades
[4:02:06] koolaidking456: tf is broken he’s actually fun to play now
[4:02:29] GideonBast: @norie_____ they do, if you look at patch notes they have a color key system that shows what’s nerfed or buffed and if it’s targeted towards a specific skill level
[4:02:42] Bazeloth: What made tf so broken right now? Did they buff him? @koolaidking456
[4:02:43] TheTrakker: when i first played voli after the rework i was expecting the w to be an empowered aa jaymay1Derpmin
[4:03:03] Bazeloth: I know he's popular now but i dont know why
[4:03:47] Mve_Ur_Bdy: bring back double jungle meta LUL
[4:04:00] TheTrakker: tf got a bunch of ad scaling to make his ad build an option, ended up a bit over the top xD
[4:04:06] koolaidking456: he’s get bonus money everytime he crits a minion and you can build him attack speed crit and he’s pumps out the damage
[4:04:37] iiNumb3rz: Can we all agree bel veth needs a prestige skin?
[4:05:18] koolaidking456: and you can play him adc now and it’s actually a lot fun
[4:05:33] xgreatscottx: i agree, we need more ez skins i the game
[4:05:39] GideonBast: but the prestige skins are so underwhelming and have 0 new voice lines and usually lack ability animations
[4:05:47] Bazeloth: We need another lux skin
[4:05:51] Bazeloth: She doesnt have enough
[4:06:06] GideonBast: they need to really step up the prestige skins and give them worthwhile unique animations etc
[4:06:17] Naruza: There are 20 miss fortune skins we could use another
[4:06:23] TheTrakker: wasnt the funny part that lux doesnt actually have the most skins? (yet xD)
[4:06:25] Bazeloth: Someone clip that ouf of context please LUL
[4:06:26] lackmind9: Jesus that terrified me
[4:06:37] rexxarhero4: least feminine league player
[4:06:39] legendod1: bro that scream in my ears LOL
[4:06:47] iiNumb3rz: I wants to go look at laypea
[4:06:51] legendod1: mandom you said... i think not
[4:06:59] Burgerbrater1702: what do u think of voli? will he be picked in proplay
[4:07:14] iiNumb3rz: Kaypea stream and see if she reacted
[4:07:29] Bazeloth: I think miss fortune has the most skins alongside other champions like Ezreal, Lux, and Ahri
[4:09:05] rexxarhero4: i guess ksante doesnt need nerfs guys
[4:09:06] Sejstargazin: 2 minute ult CD? that's the worst CD in the game
[4:09:58] xgreatscottx: nashors tooth voli just noob bait?
[4:11:10] Sejstargazin: nicee
[4:11:41] Sejstargazin: 94cs
