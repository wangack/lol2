[1:23:05] WorlldSinger: Urgot is yuumis safe option and they'll do okay together but top lane isnt going to win on its own, its just prolonging a loss
[1:23:06] Angelyc: If yuumi urgot are duo makes sense
[1:23:15] gigachadgodsu: As a Former Cat player, It just feels better to attach to someone who can stay alive longer bestie

[1:24:52] via_trita: buff ran out yeah
[1:25:02] zTimmy: she doesn't go on anyone else? wtf lol
[1:25:07] gigachadgodsu: Picking Yuumi is already inting ngl
[1:25:19] xBoomShotBaby: i would be pissed if i was that Vayne tbh
[1:25:31] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: True dat
[1:25:37] Jurlestia_Quinn: the amount of Asol/smolder combos ive had to play in the last two weeks has annoyed me to no end lol
[1:25:48] Darkcyter: @Jurlestia_Quinn kaypHello
[1:26:05] xBoomShotBaby: no shame to Yuumi players but cmon like you have a Vayne on your team...
[1:26:05] ShadowVixenXO: youre right, but they're duo so they arent gonna listen
[1:26:07] Jurlestia_Quinn: @Darkcyter heeeeeeyyy
[1:26:23] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: Yuumis are either really good or super fking bad there's no in between unfortunately
[1:26:36] som963: did karma rq
[1:26:41] som963: nvm
[1:26:43] zTimmy: urgot prob yelling at yummi "DO NOT GO ON ANYONE ELSE" LUL
[1:26:45] ObsceneSanity: i dont bother questioning the logic of yuumi players. I hardly ever see them stick to the adc after laning bc they stick to who they think is the carry
[1:26:46] Sleepe18: Maybe it's just low ELO but I've experienced Morgana carrying as support a lot. It's so much fun
[1:26:48] fluffycloudlove: did I miss the prediction?!?! kaypTroll kaypTroll
[1:27:11] gigachadgodsu: Urgot is Yuumi's long lost daddy
[1:27:13] irritatedunicorn: They picked Yuumi on top of abandoning their adc it's honestly almost reportable XD
[1:27:28] xBoomShotBaby: but she doesnt even go to Vayne for a split second PoroSad
[1:27:42] ShadowVixenXO: vayne such a good late game champ
[1:27:49] applecinnamonkas: powerspike when
[1:28:01] Darkcyter: @irritatedunicorn YO kaypHello
[1:28:03] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: I lost the beginning of the game, did yuumi ever play with her vayne or did she just straight up go to top to her duo?
[1:28:08] Sleepe18: I don't understand people trying new shit in ranked first. Why not play a casual game and learn if it's worth playing or not
[1:28:14] ibunnyzeka: they have too big lead for 5 vs 5
[1:28:22] ObsceneSanity: @AmIEvenLivingAnymore yuumi i think still has vayne as her bf
[1:28:28] ObsceneSanity: bestfriend*
[1:28:29] Jurlestia_Quinn: once smolder gets his stacks, the game gets super hard if they protect him
[1:28:31] gigachadgodsu: It feels bad to play vayne when no one peels for ya
[1:28:32] irritatedunicorn: @Darkcyter vicksyHeart
[1:29:04] ibunnyzeka: but did u ever get sniped ??
[1:29:07] applecinnamonkas: eve pdf mode
[1:29:11] Jurlestia_Quinn: eve is a little fed...sheesh

[1:29:20] ibunnyzeka: damn
[1:29:27] Angelyc: Im curious as to what urgots name means
[1:29:31] Squidymon: 5k dmg in 1.5s monkaW
[1:29:34] Jurlestia_Quinn: vayne is still yuumis bff after all that time @.@
[1:29:53] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: Well that's something
[1:30:01] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: Interesting game
[1:30:10] zTimmy: had an enemy kass go 39/8 LUL fun game
[1:30:20] gigachadgodsu: Yuumi saying there's no bffs cause it's league unless it's bff fries
[1:30:22] Jurlestia_Quinn: proly, cuz u wont be able to zhonya during the charm duration XD
[1:30:33] Sleepe18: This is the kinda game you just gotta have fun, play smart, and hope the others pull it together
[1:30:55] Squidymon: the wombo !

[1:31:54] Jurlestia_Quinn: karma/smolder/tf/asol...im sooooo tired of these 4 showing up in my games lol
[1:32:09] Darkcyter: @irritatedunicorn playing any pokemon game?
[1:32:25] guiltyprawn: Stockholm syndrome much, KelZ? Kappa
[1:32:26] Chandelinus: Smolder is just an item shop accident
[1:32:29] ElementalGt: Are we giga chadding today Kaypea
[1:32:35] Zawesomesauce: :(

[1:33:14] bluesiies: have you ever gotten a penta on viktor?
[1:33:26] Chandelinus: but when are we nerfing support tho
[1:33:41] Jurlestia_Quinn: AD tf should never be a thing. Like...he stuns you with a point and click and does insane AD damage with AS
[1:33:58] ShadowVixenXO: @Jurlestia_Quinn literally
[1:34:09] gigachadgodsu: @jurlestia_quinn PERIODT

[1:37:18] som963: nice brain move on the tp
[1:37:22] som963: !!
[1:37:23] AllOfKingsPotato: EZ
[1:37:25] kenshie89: gggsss
[1:37:33] Soff199: ggs that was such a hard game, you really deserved the win
[1:37:36] Sleepe18: gg!
[1:37:45] Sleepe18: Urgot didn't deserve that tho
[1:37:47] poncho_goblin22: she may have killed you 9 times, but she won‚Äôt kill you 10 times! kaypPog
[1:37:48] som963: that game was so ez ngl Kappa
[1:37:48] xBoomShotBaby: Vayne kept it cool
[1:37:50] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: The vayne had rock solid patience yeah
[1:37:57] som963: very satisfying to see an eve smolder lose
[1:37:59] som963: !!
[1:38:03] Niomah: That Urgot has the attitude of a middle school bully
[1:38:55] imyumss: maybe he missclicked
[1:39:16] xBoomShotBaby: ok but why would top and support duo? kaypTroll
[1:39:21] Sleepe18: Cleaning up these streets!
[1:39:28] WorlldSinger: as soon as someone inevitably puts ez at the end of the game my team or not, reported
[1:39:29] ibunnyzeka: !opgg
[1:39:29] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu

[1:39:31] Gresit: gresitYEIIJINX gresitYEIIJINX gresitYEIIJINX gresitYEIIJINX
[1:39:35] ChiinoCJS: hi!
[1:39:41] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: Top sup duo can do great but this was not an example of that lol
[1:39:48] imyumss: faker is never toxic, true story
[1:39:52] Chandelinus: geez just 1v2 them Kappa
[1:39:58] Sleepe18: That goes for anything in life, never an excuse to be a twat
[1:39:59] Niomah: I mean they can do ok if they are duo to communicate
[1:40:03] via_trita: he probably honored to try and help counter any report put in. I can see a riot mod going "well they were an ass but they did honor in the end, so we'll give him a warning"
[1:40:07] alshehabalali: How are you KP it has been a while since I said hi
[1:40:11] Niomah: Since top is mostly an island atm
[1:40:36] yepein99: Hi kay
[1:40:51] Niomah: omg what the heck is this ad with two flowers literally making out
[1:40:55] Niomah: oh doordash
[1:41:27] HeshamYoussef: there's a two years old knows your name and your stream for two years straight :D she asks about "kaboba" to start your stream.. love from Egypt
[1:41:32] Niomah: I can't unsee that lol
[1:41:35] via_trita: true league players know that doesnt work lol
[1:41:38] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: If i know twats in ranked he did it to mock you lol
[1:41:56] ShadowVixenXO: oh wow not only are they a duo they just do that when they play, urgot and yuumi every game xD
[1:42:05] zTimmy: getting tampon ads LUL
[1:42:12] Niomah: YOu died a lot but you didn't mental boom and stayed relevant to the rest of theg ame
[1:42:51] Niomah: the biggest hurdle in league is the mental boom
[1:43:06] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: You always try kp, you're a very consistent player in every round you play
[1:43:17] zTimmy: yeah
[1:43:17] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: Which is very admirable
[1:43:24] Niomah: yes ma'am. I saw the weirdest doordash ad ever during it
[1:43:47] Chandelinus: oh boy Karma Smolder and Eve. Long time no see
[1:44:07] ShadowVixenXO: I recently been playing ranked on an alt and idk why but its helped my mental with ranked so much to have two accounts
[1:44:07] pianostics: Good afternoon everyone <3 Broxah had a long stream, and what a better segway than into some mid lane for the evening :)
[1:44:12] BiSettual: Watch him spam ff right after that LUL
[1:44:13] jt_black_93: naafiri top kinda sus o.o
[1:44:16] ShadowVixenXO: feels like less pressure on myself xD
[1:44:53] guiltyprawn: Welp, this time the Karma isn't duo with the jungler. Now she's duo with the toplaner  PepeLmao
[1:45:00] ShadowVixenXO: everyone is a meta andy now days
[1:45:02] ObsceneSanity: if balancing didnt mean also setting new metas for pro play so its not the same champs every year, the game would be more fun
[1:45:12] mustangoors: why did you stop the #sotd FeelsBadMan
[1:45:25] SonicSlice: it did not
[1:45:34] xBoomShotBaby: such a chill song kaypVibe
[1:45:50] Darkcyter: kaypWHAT
[1:46:00] RCStableSteven: i have a Peep Fetish; Lil Peep's music is good for the Deed
[1:46:02] mustangoors: fair enough
[1:46:17] via_trita: insta is getting close to becoming twitter, i mean X
[1:46:34] som963: i am not feeling the new bg sound change this season
[1:46:39] som963: i always mute the background now
[1:46:48] mustangoors: if you were to have the same rate of audince but you were to play another game, would you quit leauge for it?
[1:47:58] mustangoors: im just tryna figure out are you bored of league tbh
[1:48:12] zTimmy: waiting for league of legends 2
[1:48:25] via_trita: if she every stop streaming LoL she'd just play it in her off time
[1:48:27] Sleepe18: Back in the day, Ahri was a good supp. Is she still viable?
[1:48:40] jt_black_93: The MMO Riot is working on might come out in the year 2052, so you could always stream that as a little old lady. :D
[1:48:47] noctroewich: And you can always try new stuff too
[1:49:07] guiltyprawn: In league, every game is different. Some games the enemy toplaner gets fed. Some games the enemy jungler. Some games maybe even the mid laner. Or perhaps it's both and all of them Kappa
[1:49:09] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: It was wonderful seeing you again kels, imma go back to league! Good luck and adios chat <3 DinoDance
[1:49:12] noctroewich: I didn't know you were an OG streamer!
[1:49:47] ObsceneSanity: you saying 4 hours of league is too much?
[1:49:48] Sleepe18: So close to a kill
[1:50:03] noctroewich: Holy shit congrats
[1:50:11] sovitiaisavampire: 1 match of league is too much
[1:50:23] sovitiaisavampire: opening the client is too much league
[1:50:26] noctroewich: What all roles and stuff have you played the last few years?
[1:50:29] via_trita: 4 hours without breaks is a lot on the mental
[1:50:38] Teekwan: Karma's really out to get ya, huh?
[1:50:55] sovitiaisavampire: which is why CHEESE picks are goated
[1:51:15] noctroewich: I only love off meta honestly
[1:51:18] Squidymon: heh heh, yeah who would use that? monkaW
[1:51:19] jt_black_93: it does make learning the game easier for new players
[1:51:43] AmIEvenLivingAnymore: OK hold on I got tf on aram, do I go ad pls help
[1:51:43] rmvfrostbite: Hello friend! hope youre doing well and are having good games :)
[1:51:59] imyumss: I remember playing 75 minutes games before, now its considerd long when its 45 minutes
[1:52:03] drtesseract22: drtesseract22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey KP! Hope Monday games are going well!
[1:52:17] Tavernously: I think a lot of the prblems with sites like that is people also just autobuild the items. They dont even think about the comps and what items might be swapped in and out from those builds
[1:52:18] noctroewich: KP off meta series when?!
[1:52:23] jt_black_93: yeah it definitely removes a knowledge base we used to have back in the early days of league. it also makes it so that everyone knows every build for every champion and what's meta.
[1:52:26] ObsceneSanity: My favorite thing is going into a NORM draft game, saying you're learning a new champ and your team saying to report
[1:52:27] jt_black_93: so people flame builds.
[1:52:46] RadiantWisp: pew pew
[1:52:49] Chandelinus: Often times OTPs even have their own builds which are not considered optimal by "Standards"
[1:52:50] jt_black_93: the exhaust was tragic
[1:52:55] Teekwan: Btw i saw that you won the previous game. I'm so glad, it seemed extremely difficult, but you pulled it off in the end. Another W for the positive mental attitude! kaypFlower
[1:52:55] een029: what a flash from her
[1:53:03] via_trita: got the flash
[1:53:10] smoluri: Every game ive had theres always one person where they have such a weak mental, most often its someone saying ''ff'' at like 5 minutes in because they died once and its so tiring to play with, even if you mute them you can tell theyre tilted by the way they play
[1:53:16] via_trita: from karma
[1:53:17] noctroewich: KP would you do an off meta series?
[1:53:46] jt_black_93: i too am stuck in emerald on lux and ahri atm lol
[1:53:49] Sunnytinker: Hey KayPea kaypHello Hi Chat kaypHello
[1:53:50] som963: and who cares what other people think
[1:53:51] cherrikoala: yeahh i'm very new to the game and people were yelling at me asking if i was high lol in like, my 10th ever norm game ... i'm honestly scared to play ranked solo now :')
[1:53:58] Soff199: i actually really enjoy whenever you try new champs kaypSpy  it's always very fun!
[1:54:02] atticus_wren: We here for the vibes sis, play what you want!
[1:54:03] sparkweee: @KayPea Dont forgot about the anivia! We enjoy watching that one
[1:54:08] Sleepe18: Nah, you should play whatever is fun
[1:54:10] MissUnfortuneK: Ohh no I lost 2 hours of streaming üò≠üò≠üò≠ hey KP how are games today?? üéâ
[1:54:25] noctroewich: I think it'd be more exciting for you, too
[1:54:50] Sleepe18: @cherrikoala I'm right there with you. Every now and then someone will be really nice and make me want to play the game more though lol
[1:54:54] ObsceneSanity: Balancing nerfed mages so hard you cant carry games unless you're super far ahead.
[1:54:55] jt_black_93: back when ahri could build DFG and charm caused 20% more damage
[1:55:10] Oakley85: @KayPea I think a streamer should always play what they want to play. Imo its much more fun to watch people do what they want to do instead of watching people not have as much fun trying to please the chat. We should be here to watch you have fun
[1:55:22] damndani_: You dont get bored playing the same champs everyday?
[1:55:29] noctroewich: Donation for off meta day?
[1:56:07] Oakley85: Lets be honest. I think we would all enjoy watching you play Zed again
[1:56:16] Oakley85: Or Yassuo
[1:56:26] Sleepe18: I'm a supp, and try new champs but always come back to Morgana or Nautilus
[1:56:58] noctroewich: Yeah shit that is broken for 5 patches
[1:57:03] noctroewich: Or years
[1:57:23] lolarbi: Has bard even been bot yet
[1:57:37] Nadro: ive been spamming smolder mid. such a fun champion
[1:57:41] atticus_wren: You're a very entertaining and engaging streamer we would watch you play yummi mid lol.
[1:57:53] ObsceneSanity: too many comeback mechanics to carry by mechanics alone
[1:58:01] via_trita: riot - "they want us to nerf this, we'll just buff that"
[1:58:45] kid_kirua: no way she gets out
[1:58:48] Teekwan: @Oakley85 It really shows when they're comfortable, and they give off good vibes. Much rather watch the natural joy then the cringe pretender StinkyCheese
[1:58:49] kid_kirua: nt :(
[1:59:25] zoki_2706: Then Karma hit  mantra q delete whole team XD
[1:59:49] jzipfel20: How was the family visit?
[2:00:27] ShadowVixenXO: @cherrikoala I'm sorry thats been your experience. I hate that being most new peoples experience. I try to be as nice and helpful to new players as I can
[2:00:36] zoki_2706: Oh heartsteel anivia is another level of broken lul
[2:01:09] noctroewich: We love creative stuff
[2:01:25] imyumss: Do u play the game offstream sometimes, just for fun ?
[2:01:32] dylanship: how can bard steal the drake?
[2:01:49] eniiluap: Hello everyone GoldPLZ
[2:02:10] xxxMAULxxx: That's a ballz move Kelse having that much faith the team was gonna follow you up. I like it.
[2:02:26] Drifter226: I don't play LoL but in games, when I am getting whooped.. which is often, I try to figure out their strategy and see how i can stump them. I like watching LoL and you are great!
[2:02:26] tim_the_cake: is he playing offrole?
[2:02:32] jzipfel20: Haha tell him to only play support
[2:02:47] SirPoggingtonU: so you're saying he's him, essentially
[2:02:54] tim_the_cake: @jzipfel20 have him play only yuumi
[2:03:09] RadiantWisp: you didnt pick up herald
[2:03:12] RadiantWisp: sadge
[2:03:34] RadiantWisp: i wonder if you could take it with R
[2:03:38] GN_Duck: bru you didnt pick uo hearld
[2:03:42] RadiantWisp: but there's a lot of enemies
[2:03:45] noctroewich: Any particular plans for the new account?
[2:03:48] tim_the_cake: then have him play yuumi lol
[2:04:14] S17Master: There are a lot of """"supports""" that go out and just rack kills
[2:04:23] S17Master: Panth, Brand, Camille apparently
[2:04:44] shedfirekid1: started leveling up an alt as well, curious if that account will have better MMR because my current one is so scuffed
[2:04:47] xBoomShotBaby: @tim_the_cake kaypLOL kaypLOL that would be interesting
[2:05:12] exorc157: @s17master the best CC is a gray screen kaypFreya
[2:05:31] noctroewich: That Mantra Q is such a huge radius
[2:06:05] NoPainNoDane: Look i play alot of support and i love when the adc says idm if you take kills, cause obviously i ain't trynna take but I don't have ti hold back incase I set the adc off
[2:06:41] solo_poro: do you look at legit korea's ahri builds?
[2:06:42] dalig_: good afteroon @KayPea baffyBalloon
[2:06:43] NoPainNoDane: Otherwise you hold off, then neither get kills and you both die and your to blame
[2:06:49] CaramellCat: Good afternoon everyone! I hope you are doing well
[2:06:52] dalig_: hi everyone! daligCRflower
[2:07:06] ObsceneSanity: i like how you called that the team reacting this way was gunna happen when karma was 2/0
[2:07:16] Darkcyter: @CaramellCat @dalig_ kaypHello kaypHello
[2:07:30] dalig_: @Darkcyter daligHoly
[2:07:31] Rinniera: mid has been kind of frustrating this season, if im not getting camped by their jungler im getting camped by their support lmao supports just roam so much these days
[2:07:51] StarEnjoyCoco: hellooo how are you ??
[2:08:00] NoPainNoDane: I was in response to Lucas's playing support not having a go at u kaypeaaaa x
[2:08:04] S17Master: Just land your predictable CC on a champ with move speed boost, a tether that roots if you don't break it, and a nuke on command. Just do it 4Head
[2:08:15] wolterbrm2021: ur not going malignance?
[2:08:16] The1997wiki: in teamfight when karma use q+r she has back again and that how she does dmg
[2:08:23] NoPainNoDane: But when adcs say don't stress about kills 90% of those games come out as wins
[2:08:24] ObsceneSanity: @Rinniera my best games are when mid lane is left alone, my worst is when theres a constant hover around mid
[2:08:32] AvaVee: yeah im ngl mid is a shit show always LMAO
[2:08:55] Rinniera: @ObsceneSanity 100% lol
[2:08:57] solo_poro: your team really sucking up your cs
[2:09:04] RadiantWisp: how are smolder stacks looking?
[2:09:07] noctroewich: Yeah Naafiri top talking shit lmao
[2:09:37] garlicbread0220: its the way naafiri isnt even a toplaner so they must be a midlane player which makes their lack of mid karma knowledge even worse
[2:09:48] RadiantWisp: 7/2 bard damn
[2:09:55] AvaVee: wait thats so broken
[2:09:56] georgo__: solo bolo bard, #balanced
[2:10:05] shedfirekid1: good thing riot is happy with the state of game balance kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti
[2:10:05] ObsceneSanity: hes got chains and boots. you cant touch him.
[2:10:06] bulibasaacaras: supp is so broken these days
[2:10:09] piertotum_: im seeing tank bards too often, whats going on here???
[2:10:11] AvaVee: he does dmg like that as a bard support
[2:10:24] RadiantWisp: I feel your stream has been very negative lately
[2:10:26] CipherAdminShady: Bard casually soloing
[2:10:26] Dracjko_Moon: Hola Kp and chat peepoHey
[2:10:33] AvaVee: POGGERS RIOT
[2:10:34] RadiantWisp: especially after last patch
[2:10:45] Drifter226: why is the balancing so broken?
[2:10:49] garlicbread0220: with tank items that dont do damage at that
[2:11:00] AllOfKingsPotato: missing Karen emote
[2:11:00] KiriariQT: Well tbf the new patch is wild lmao
[2:11:01] lewhitehd69: @Darkcyter alo ppL @dalig_ alo ratirlKiss @KayPea ratirlSalute
[2:11:01] Dracjko_Moon: how are you today?
[2:11:04] HelloOctoberly: I would rather honest frustration than toxic positivity.
[2:11:08] noctroewich: Classic Mid lane mages feel BAD to me right now
[2:11:11] Sleepe18: I think it's just LoL being legitive
[2:11:12] Ranno: ur supposed to be happy a bard is soloing you
[2:11:16] Sleepe18: negitive
[2:11:17] Darkcyter: @lewhitehd69 kaypHYPERS
[2:11:21] AvaVee: complaining about the game isnt rly negative its just giving ur opinion
[2:11:24] garlicbread0220: not really positive or negative, just an observation
[2:11:26] Dracjko_Moon: Darkcyter peepoHey
[2:11:39] Darkcyter: @Dracjko_Moon kaypHello
[2:11:39] dalig_: it's called having your own opinion daligCATrevenge
[2:11:42] Sleepe18: You're the most positive League player I've seen. Don't listen!
[2:11:42] wolterbrm2021: like kp isnt liek oh no game bad reeeee, just reasoning things
[2:11:50] Darkcyter: @AvaVee @KiriariQT @wolterbrm2021 kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:11:54] RadiantWisp: I think when I found your stream you were seeing loss more as here is what happened, here is what I will do better (if you made mistakes), let's crush the next one
[2:11:58] dalig_: @lewhitehd69 hey bby baffyKiss
[2:12:03] wolterbrm2021: hihi
[2:12:05] sovitiaisavampire: the only thing negative about KP is the temperature of the countries she lives in
[2:12:09] Niomah: Listing facts about why a game is less fun lately is not complaining, its stating cause and effect
[2:12:10] AvaVee: WAIT WINNABLEEEE
[2:12:14] HelloOctoberly: you're reacting appropriately to your environment
[2:12:20] AvaVee: that was a good fight
[2:12:20] wolterbrm2021: like oh no i get oneshot for the 20th time this game so fun guys lesague is great hahahahah
[2:12:21] dalig_: daligGege daligSweetheart
[2:12:22] The1997wiki: bard is more a tank then ammumu lol
[2:12:24] lewhitehd69: damn they got clapped
[2:12:27] CaramellCat: that felt really good to watch
[2:12:29] georgo__: wanna talk about the naafiri damage late? :D
[2:12:36] lewhitehd69: @dalig_ are you winning son? ratirlBros ratirlKing
[2:12:39] KiriariQT: azy push actuallycr
[2:12:47] KiriariQT: *crazy
[2:12:49] AvaVee: yea support is broken these days
[2:12:50] garlicbread0220: league streamers who rage are popular, until youre not that positive about a tank build brad 1v1ing you when you played well anyway
[2:12:53] RadiantWisp: I don't really expect you to express yourself one way or another, whatever is on your mind will always be better than any viewer's opinions
[2:13:01] ardaozturkben: Helloo
[2:13:21] HelloOctoberly: peepoHey @lewhitehd69 peepoLove
[2:13:24] Teekwan: @RadiantWisp That's delulu behaviour. It's good to vent on things that bother you so you can go into another game clear headed. StinkyCheese
[2:13:29] wolterbrm2021: oop-
[2:13:30] dalig_: @lewhitehd69 not lately, not in life baffyPlead .. wbu?
[2:13:32] lewhitehd69: @HelloOctoberly peepoLove
[2:13:32] wolterbrm2021: drama
[2:13:35] wolterbrm2021: lemme get the popcorn
[2:13:49] garlicbread0220: when other big streamers get mad to the point of breaking their keyboards its cute but they draw the line and that bard comment
[2:13:51] RadiantWisp: I see, I am probably wrong about that part then
[2:13:56] lewhitehd69: @dalig_ nyooo NOOOO how come? ratirlSit im doping okey thanks, veeery close to catching a cold monkaS
[2:13:56] Sleepe18: I think some people in chat are just trying to rile you up
[2:14:00] murkihonest: oh shit im late af , Hi miss kaypea
[2:14:01] AllOfKingsPotato: MrDestructoid
[2:14:11] AvaVee: yay bard 1v1ing me :D Poggies
[2:14:12] lewhitehd69: permabann him kaypCaptainMaple
[2:14:12] solo_poro: wait, did he just miss all his r's on a charmed champ?
[2:14:20] doctor0616: hey Kaypea kaypPengu
[2:14:25] dalig_: it's yr stream, if he doesn't like it he can leave nickiShrug
[2:14:28] amethyst_art22: vent when necessary but what i have always liked about you is you always give you're looking at things objectively and are open to input from your community
[2:14:31] Niomah: @RadiantWisp that is kind of also insinuating that nothing in the game is broken and @KayPea is just playing bad. Or can very much be read that way, when things in the game atm are DEFINITELY broken and favoring specific types of champs.
[2:14:34] wolterbrm2021: @solo_poro lolz
[2:14:53] dalig_: @lewhitehd69 just hard time in life tbf, can't find work, feeling alone perma blah blah baffyDespair

[2:15:04] solo_poro: @wolterbrm2021 sadge
[2:15:13] Darkcyter: Ok, let me interpret this differently, probably they meant that negative stuff have been happening to the games more lately, but came off that way
[2:15:19] garlicbread0220: i mean there is a reason bard with those items is as popular as it is currently
[2:15:24] RadiantWisp: what I was trying to say is less that you are not allowed to be frustrated, but more of you have been frustrated more after patch (at least feels like it to me), and I wonder if league is more frustrating to you lately or am I wrong about that
[2:15:29] Niomah: the MR items are incredibly broken, with no effective counter to them.
[2:15:30] noctroewich: AP Mages don't feel good right now mid
[2:15:36] lewhitehd69: @dalig_ ah man that sucks daligSadge hope it turns your way soon ratirlBros
[2:15:37] SirPoggingtonU: if youre not mad when you lose, you've lost twice
[2:15:44] ucandoit69: those emotions are always reasonable when playing league in general Kappa
[2:15:47] wolterbrm2021: @RadiantWisp i mean be honest who is not frustrated the last few patches about league
[2:15:54] WorlldSinger: as soon as a teemo shoots me 1 time im already tilted so i think thats fair
[2:15:57] doctor0616: so can i be frustrated if im an ap mage main? monkaHmm
[2:16:10] noctroewich: Liandrys next?
[2:16:19] RadiantWisp: @wolterbrm2021 me, I am enjoying the hell out of playing support after the patch, and was climbing very well as a bonus
[2:16:20] AvaVee: finally brad is dead
[2:16:20] garlicbread0220: yet bards auto would do more damage to you than your full combo does to him but thats a feature, not a bug
[2:16:25] Niomah: I think the fact that @KayPea voices frustration to the game hammers home HOW broken things are right now. Even Kelsie is commenting on it!
[2:16:27] solo_poro: you did one tenth his health bar. pretty op KappaHD KappaHD
[2:16:29] atch_ha: fooyah
[2:16:38] Sleepe18: @RadiantWisp I feel that!
[2:16:39] noctroewich: @doctor0616 AP mage mids are all more frustrated right now
[2:16:53] zentex10: Dzie≈Ñ dobry <3
[2:16:55] wolterbrm2021: @RadiantWisp okay but that doesnt mean others cant be frustrated tho
[2:17:02] garlicbread0220: yeah people hold the "positive" thing over your head even when theres no possible way of you being positive in that instance
[2:17:06] Niomah: @KayPea Yeah it's kind of the equivalent of telling women to "smile more"
[2:17:20] solo_poro: ITS DEAD!!!!!
[2:17:22] zentex10: Daily dose of positive, here I can find it lol
[2:17:23] atticus_wren: Positive streaming just means you arent toxic, doesnt mean you cant be frustrated
[2:17:29] zentex10: positivity*
[2:17:31] AvaVee: @Niomah YES THIS
[2:17:33] Sleepe18: If someone is always positive, then they're delusional
[2:17:35] smokeyswrldr: ggs
[2:17:39] Sleepe18: gg
[2:17:42] imyumss: dont need kills to win games :D
[2:17:42] S17Master: This does bring up a meta point about how viewers have this expectation that if someone is not 25/8 raging at the game, the one time they do get upset is suddenly this awful evil thing that they can't do
[2:17:53] wolterbrm2021: like calling her out for being frustrated cuz mid meta is shite atm is quite... strange
[2:17:57] Jaikobu: kaypFlower
[2:17:59] wolterbrm2021: @Sleepe18 ikr
[2:18:10] BuddhaB413: voice them queen, it‚Äôs human üôåüèΩ kaypFlower
[2:18:12] dalig_: ggs <3
[2:18:17] atch_ha: just bring ignite
[2:18:20] jotnepro123: I just think Karma shouldnt do damage with her Q if she misses it...
[2:18:23] S17Master: Which is not healthy for anyone, not the viewer nor the streamer
[2:18:25] doctor0616: @noctroewich i know :D especially me because i can't play against ad assassins or Fizz LUL and i main Lux and Ahri
[2:18:32] lewhitehd69: me ratirlMe ratirlDisguise
[2:18:33] smacbasan01: smacbasan01 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:18:34] dalig_: @lewhitehd69 it will baffyHug
[2:18:40] Jaikobu: that‚Äôs not fair to you guys at all
[2:18:40] RadiantWisp: you also mention matchmaking a lot, and after the match, when you lose, you lose much more LP than you gain when you win - those seem to be points of a lot of frustration. wtf is up with the LP gain/loss? I have no clue how game calculates those
[2:18:48] lewhitehd69: @dalig_ i believe dankHug
[2:18:51] WorlldSinger: i've only started watching league streamers since starting playing recently, who else do you reccomend?
[2:18:54] solo_poro: you aren't allowed to be mad KappaHD
[2:18:58] nottaicho: ZzZz
[2:19:03] Sleepe18: You're supposed to get upset when things are bad. People shouldn't expect you to fake your opinion on things to seem more positive
[2:19:04] thomasmueller21: @kaypea noleague, no cry
[2:19:11] Scovillain_: i like your voice. very nice for accompany when at work AYAYA
[2:19:14] Teekwan: Tho if you kept it all those comments pent up inside you, you would have eventually gave up. Venting is also part of positivity, and why we win games like these kaypFlower <3
[2:19:14] jimbob_ywert: I‚Äôm back, love seeing that 3-0. not surprising from a week game tho :)
[2:19:14] noctroewich: @doctor0616 I literally picked up Heimerdinger to deal with the current mid lane issues
[2:19:21] RadiantWisp: no it's all good, it's a good assumption that I was simply blaming you for being frustrated, like you need to be positive all the time
[2:19:34] zoki_2706: Halfway to 6-0 u got it :D
[2:19:39] DragonOfSorrow: You're human. You're gonna get frustrated
[2:20:01] Sleepe18: @RadiantWisp Holy shit, someone can actually own a mistake. Respect!
[2:20:16] oskewow: kaypTeach
[2:20:19] doctor0616: @noctroewich idk when i played heimer :o i should try the other mages :D
[2:20:25] shedfirekid1: I‚Äôm losing 30-32 and winning 22 regardless of how well I do compared to my team. this is making it impossible to not be frustrated
[2:20:28] solo_poro: comeback games are a lot more rare, and those are my favorite
[2:20:39] wolterbrm2021: tbf it want neccesarily a mistake but a miscommunication
[2:20:43] BuddhaB413: I don‚Äôt really play anymore but I watch streamers, why everyone got 2000+ hp? even the adcs üíÄ
[2:20:46] AllOfKingsPotato: ‚úåÔ∏è
[2:20:59] Jaikobu: yes this season was nasty :(
[2:21:06] zentex10: most of the games are like a coin flip right now
[2:21:14] noctroewich: Yeah they are making changes around it with next patch for lp I think
[2:21:22] RadiantWisp: so start of the season messed up the MR for you and that's what is causing the LP shenanigans, I see!
[2:21:23] wolterbrm2021: senna adc and tf in mid top adc is stoopid
[2:21:25] smoluri: I had a terrible point where i was getting +20 and -34... it hurttttt
[2:21:32] solo_poro: you just gotta believe or something
[2:21:41] zentex10: like how are you suppose to rank up when you lose more LP than you gain, twisted logic riot james
[2:22:01] Kunafish: Stuck in bronze, have over 100 games
[2:22:03] wolterbrm2021: mmr is fcked for a lot of ppl i feel
[2:22:05] Jaketin8: @BuddhaB413 Because riots solution to tanks being too tanky, is to slap tons of dmg everywhere, so they have to slap sustain to all roles because of the dmg increases everyone getting one shotted without it
[2:22:06] Kunafish: i hit silver once
[2:22:08] Sleepe18: @zentex10 Right? You'd have to have a very positive winrate
[2:22:11] noctroewich: Phreak talked about these glitches with LP recently
[2:22:13] HelloOctoberly: +18 -33
[2:22:13] Drifter226: do people pay for new characters to use?
[2:22:14] jotnepro123: *karma misses her Q*, half hp
[2:22:14] zentex10: + 25 -20
[2:22:16] RadiantWisp: is there a way I can see how many games I have this season?
[2:22:17] atticus_wren: mine is too
[2:22:23] gretchen2137: G4 +16 -34
[2:22:26] Oivichyhuiseaux: +25 -20
[2:22:28] Iruykaa: + 19 -30... Yeah.. losing streak
[2:22:30] yumiibee: win 23\24 lose about the same amount
[2:22:32] tronofcool: +25/30 -20
[2:22:38] shedfirekid1: not over 100, but even when I had 67% wr after 40 games I was +22 -27
[2:22:42] irritatedunicorn: My boyfriend and I went into flex with a friend he went 30/4 and it gave him iron 4 which I know isn't the same thing but kind of insane
[2:22:44] tuberculoman: loose 30+ gain 20
[2:22:51] BuddhaB413: in November I had around +22 -31
[2:22:55] smoluri: +22 or 24 and -24
[2:23:00] jotnepro123: *Karma misses her Q* half hp‚Ä¶
[2:23:10] zentex10: @Sleepe18 which is kinda impossible bcs this game is constructed to have 50% win ratio If you think about it xd
[2:23:16] RadiantWisp: I have only 52 games this season
[2:23:18] StTimmy: I guess with the system rigged against players, how do people climb to challenger?
[2:23:22] NoPainNoDane: Ngl I'm thrashing this season, wins I get 32 losses minus 20
[2:23:28] ObsceneSanity: the negative lp gains to me feel like Rito went about punishing boosted accounts in a way that ended up hitting everyone instead.
[2:23:28] georgo__: I went down from s1 98 to b1 20 in 2 days :D
[2:23:28] BuddhaB413: I‚Äôm also poop at the game and been hard stuck Gold 1-2 lmao
[2:23:30] S17Master: @StTimmy Brute force
[2:23:32] noctroewich: Wasn't Lp Supposed to just be static below a certain elo??
[2:23:37] Iruykaa: Its so hard to climb right now
[2:23:37] llucas_kx: I play in LAS server and I‚Äôm in the same situation as you, stuck between emerald IV and Plat I kaypFreya
[2:23:47] reginaphalange00: HeyGuys <3 kaypFlower
[2:23:55] Niomah: They need to make Malignance bonus cooldown for ults only work on an ult that in and of itself does damage. Not on ones that boost another ability
[2:24:01] Niomah: and for the burn
[2:24:03] S17Master: @S17Master Also being in GM or Challenger before things got this bad
[2:24:11] wolterbrm2021: to be fair ive had a lot frustrations too last few days w league
[2:24:25] Kunafish: Was there a season where Rank system felt more balanced?
[2:24:27] Niomah: because basically if Karma hits her q on a champ, with malignance, her Q-R is up all the time
[2:24:31] alluring_grace: There are too many broken champs, and a lot of people are abusing them. I hate seeing Aurelion Sol and Smolder the most. But I have to ban Brand cause he is just too easy to be a problem.
[2:24:34] StTimmy: @S17Master what does that mean?
[2:24:45] zentex10: In the worst scenario I was getting 3 LP for the win and lose about 20, by the way it was when the new rank system came out (no promos between g2 and g1 etc.) @KayPea
[2:24:49] ObsceneSanity: @Niomah malignance isnt the problem. It's buy rate is pretty low, so its the champs that do use it that need a tweek
[2:24:50] sovitiaisavampire: kaypFreya looks like a plushie rn
[2:25:02] NoPainNoDane: I played karma support before maligned came out but since it's been out I carry support alot as her hahshaha
[2:25:03] RadiantWisp: oh that's a very good point, validating the community when this frustration is happening all around
[2:25:27] georgo__: +20 -28 for me mostly, when I go under s4 I gain +18 lose 30++
[2:25:32] Sleepe18: I was just looking at my stats and realized that most of my games are like 20-25 minutes
[2:25:40] Sleepe18: everyone tilts too quick
[2:25:55] S17Master: @StTimmy Just keep playing and throwing themselves at the game until they eventually get in
[2:25:56] zentex10: It is, I even reported that for riot games company xdd, and they said there is nothing they can do and they understand my frustration but thats for it xdd
[2:26:10] Scovillain_: im 3-1 now. there is hope KEKW
[2:26:10] ObsceneSanity: if you just walked in to stream without seeing today's score you'd think you were having a bad day. But nope, its just another example where winning is just as frustrating as losing lol
[2:26:40] zentex10: Imagine playing 50min game just to get  3 LP and then lose 20 LP in 15 min game KEKW
[2:26:42] HelloOctoberly: I feel you. So much
[2:27:03] StTimmy: @S17Master Ahh i see, so not even a matter of skill anymore. that's sad to see.
[2:27:12] MissUnfortuneK: I find it very challenging to climb up in nowadays
[2:27:15] zoki_2706: Everything fuked when riot added emerald..So many things went wrong from there
[2:27:19] georgo__: lp effect is much higher on losing than winning
[2:27:28] jotnepro123: k
[2:27:30] som963: its time we move on from league to hearthstone
[2:27:34] som963: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:27:40] som963: battlegrounds feel good
[2:27:53] noctroewich: I keep my text chat off unless people are friendly in pre chat lobby
[2:27:54] Kunafish: What season felt the best?
[2:27:59] mouritchou: that always happens to me i be 5/0 and someone 0/10 flmaing me lmao
[2:28:00] SixAFourA: SixAFourA subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 87 months! Hope you have a wonderful day/week/month here in the basement kaypLove
[2:28:04] StTimmy: As a viewer I have the advantage of being able to just move to a different game if it's frustrating. Content creator is a whole different thing. You're locked in.
[2:28:06] zentex10: at this point "system" is taking you down not players xd
[2:28:08] guiltyprawn: Singing yah yah yah yah
[2:28:28] atichii: season 3 was peak league. you just had to be there
[2:28:35] RadiantWisp: heartsteel lux?
[2:28:39] BuddhaB413: LUXX
[2:28:41] shedfirekid1: @kaypea reminder for a prediction this game!
[2:28:44] spookysboos: im a super new league player and i have never turned chat on because i‚Äôm scared lol
[2:28:45] dylanship: Can we have some magma lux :D
[2:28:48] noctroewich: Yeah I just turn chat on to like, compliment my teams
[2:28:59] RadiantWisp: team has a lot of frontline
[2:29:06] DarbiesM: Are you still dating Sivhd?
[2:29:06] Osko3: @spookysboos good, don't do it, pings are enough
[2:29:06] shedfirekid1: that‚Äôs what I am here for kaypCozy
[2:29:07] atichii: i got snowmoon and spirit blossom ahri from chest lol
[2:29:07] ObsceneSanity: @spookysboos leave the chat off.
[2:29:08] dylanship: <3
[2:29:14] zTimmy: turn chat on :)

[3:18:14] croquetadepapa68: not bard ulting himself
[3:18:42] zentex10: or turret shots should ignore armor
[3:18:46] el_mitro: Remember the Laser turrets?? they were burning tanks
[3:18:47] Arisutra: never a good sign when a bard has to ult himself
[3:19:05] lilCACTUSS9: It got better, but we still have a long way to go in order to balance the tanks in terms of dmg  / HP / armor / magic resist
[3:19:10] Martybggg: maybe it would be good if they make it so the more hp you have the more dmg you take the more tower shots hit you
