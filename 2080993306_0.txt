[1:38:13] svezz1: jinxs who build shiv belongs in jail
[1:38:31] svezz1: yeap call the police.
[1:39:31] ADCPurple: @svezz1 not bad, perma wave clear and can boost IE by 400 gold and the wave clear gets more cs so even faster ie
[1:39:49] ADCPurple: plus kraken doesnt even feel good as passive and you get same stats
[1:39:57] ADCPurple: crit items suck so
[1:40:48] svezz1: @ADCPurple i mean yea i get the idea of wave clear but jinx is already good at pushing after 1 item spike so i wouldnt see it the best option.
[1:41:04] svezz1: who am i to judge but
[1:41:04] ADCPurple: 300 gold cheaper, shiv plus 1 auto clicks ranged
[1:41:10] ADCPurple: instead of 4 autos with kraken
[1:41:18] ADCPurple: its a big difference
[1:41:43] ADCPurple: -4 autos a push a wave is quite big
[1:41:45] svezz1: jinx fell of hard on this season
[1:41:48] ADCPurple: more time for sona to poke

[2:13:39] shiny00: isnt eclipse build goes with hail of boners?
[2:13:52] 365Doors: HUH
[2:14:05] ADCPurple: someone explain to me why eclipem has more ad then INFINITY EDGE, a shield every 6 seconds (less sometimes), max hp ad dmg AND ability haste
[2:14:12] 365Doors: well you dont really need HoB for eclipse, just auto and press q
[2:14:16] ADCPurple: pog good job riot crit is for sure worth it
[2:14:19] ADCPurple: cheaper too
[2:14:55] shiny00: it lacks on synergizing with other builds
[2:15:44] ADCPurple: ?
[2:15:45] 365Doors: @shiny00 eclipse or crit items?
[2:15:55] shiny00: eclipse ofc
[2:15:57] ADCPurple: its good with so many lethality builds
[2:16:37] trommelfeuer1: @jackspektra what is the final item build?
[2:16:45] ADCPurple: im yapping about how eclipse is broken
[2:16:48] martinucs: How u fast evolve with e?
[2:16:58] shiny00: yes it doesnt ramp ur crit like IE does
[2:17:16] Kasunylol: do you always go eclipse no matter if final build is ap or ad?
[2:18:00] vens147: isn't the usual build eclipse into nashor's?
[2:18:14] ADCPurple: @shiny00 okay true but if they have boots its alr 12% less dmg, and 20% less if they have wardens
[2:18:30] joeyyl: eclipse does seem kind of nasty
[2:18:31] ADCPurple: your 3.3k gold you spent is doomed with 1000
[2:18:49] selenic2: phreak bout to come axe kick your pc for using having a defensive item passive on adc
[2:19:03] FeelsGoodStream: Isnt Kaisa not great overall atm tho?
[2:19:12] ADCPurple: she got buffed she feels alright
[2:19:36] shiny00: @ADCPurple issue is u cant go eclipse except on few adcs
[2:19:46] ADCPurple: thats what im saying
[2:19:51] shiny00: niche item
[2:19:57] turbogodxx: hows eclipse on draven?
[2:20:01] FeelsGoodStream: @ADCPurple How does she handle the scaling meta of Senna/Smolder tho?
[2:20:04] ADCPurple: im saying that crit sucks ass that adc's would buy anything but crit
[2:20:35] skaww___: what about samira
[2:20:36] ADCPurple: @FeelsGoodStream unsure but kaisa is actually good into smolder if you have engage because you can punish and get in range of him with r
[2:20:46] vens147: that taliyah is cookin
[2:20:54] artest07: Shrek gappog
[2:21:06] ADCPurple: i would complete stop complaing about adc if they brought back shield on BT
[2:21:07] shiny00: shojin build on luc9ian with navori?
[2:21:44] 365Doors: wait draven cant proc eclipse? or you mean it just takes way too long or too much investment to be worth it?
[2:21:46] vens147: @ADCPurple +1
[2:21:59] gravitytracks: I mean adc just needs to scale better imo
[2:22:08] gravitytracks: mid champs outscale adcs which doesnt make sense to me
[2:22:17] joeyyl: nt nt
[2:22:25] vens147: @365Doors no spells to use i guess , you want to keep your E to disengage
[2:22:25] ADCPurple: its just crit items suck ass not adcs
[2:22:35] demonic_mako: ulting for a 150 gold support LUL LUL LUL
[2:22:35] turbogodxx: for the misery u have to endure to scale on adc u should be able to 2 auto anyone past 30 mins
[2:22:37] shiny00: shojin build on luc9ian with navori? thoughts?
[2:22:48] joeyyl: @demonic_mako the game is over lol
[2:22:51] Kasunylol: is rageblade better than terminus 3rd?
[2:23:04] barto_7: how would you fix adc role? @Jackspektra
[2:23:23] mams__: do you think we're one buff away to navori and ie from adc being a good role in soloq again? @Jackspektra
[2:23:33] demonic_mako: buff adc nerf support PopNemo
[2:23:51] greeniris_: well navori is gettin buffed next patch
[2:23:53] ADCPurple: make bt a good item for 3400 gold
[2:23:57] ADCPurple: @greeniris_ nope its not
[2:23:57] 365Doors: if you just walk up and auto twice with HoB on draven then it's procced. but it opens you up to taking damage from enemy cuz it's not very fast

[3:06:35] bizzjizz: inshallah heretics sees the light and puts him in
[3:06:46] maxozabojca99: that was illegal
[3:06:46] SingularFish: 🚓

[3:07:11] SingularFish: Illegal hook hitbox
[3:07:47] influenya: there’s no e on your hud what does e do on Aphelios?
[3:08:11] SingularFish: Respect it
[3:08:12] xDeekri: there is no e
[3:08:30] shiny00: @influenya q for ad w for attack speed and E for lethality
[3:08:33] dea1hwish: @influenya by leveling q/w/e he upgrades his stats
[3:08:34] influenya: @xdeekri but he said he likes to put points in q before e
[3:08:37] shiny00: just stats per lvl
[3:08:42] influenya: ohhhh
[3:08:50] FeelsGoodStream: Aphelios only has two abilities to use. He levels stats with QWE.
[3:08:54] influenya: so what does q and W do on the screen
[3:09:05] maxozabojca99: e just shows what gun is next
[3:09:08] shiny00: w swaps q use the current gun ability
[3:09:15] dea1hwish: q - ability of main-handed weapon, w - swap weapon with secondary
[3:09:16] FeelsGoodStream: W shows the second active gun
[3:09:43] influenya: @maxozabojca99 where do you see e
[3:09:48] influenya: thanks chatters
[3:09:55] influenya: for helping me understand
[3:10:05] maxozabojca99: @influenya when you press e, it shows what gun is next
[3:10:09] maxozabojca99: I think
[3:10:09] SingularFish: Not close
[3:10:09] 365Doors: wtf
[3:10:11] donkey_brains_: ?
[3:10:13] 365Doors: clean
[3:10:17] dea1hwish: EZ
[3:10:20] FeelsGoodStream: The little icon to the northeast of his secondary weapon is probably considered the "E" icon in this isntance.
[3:10:32] FeelsGoodStream: instance*
[3:10:42] influenya: @maxozabojca99 like after the q w guns he has in inventory on q and w?
[3:11:04] influenya: @feelsgoodstream ahh okay thanks yeah it’s the the blue one now was red before

[3:11:28] SingularFish: Ahri is kinda strong in 14.4 eh
[3:11:38] influenya: what does he mean by using red and green to fix weapons @feelsgoodstream
[3:11:43] FeelsGoodStream: Pressing E doesnt do anything as far as I know, it just shows on the HUD his two active weapons and then the next one coming up so you see 3 out of the 5 guns at all times to keep your gun rotation in order
[3:11:45] SingularFish: 54% 📈
[3:11:49] influenya: how did weapons break?
[3:11:55] ofizzor: !tierlist
[3:11:55] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/Jackspektra/status/1755987824392704128
[3:12:06] influenya: @feelsgoodstream thank you!!
[3:12:15] FeelsGoodStream: His guns will show in the order that they expire. Aphelios gets 50 ammo for his guns when he gets them. Using their ability consumes 10 ammo, autos consume one auto
[3:12:22] SingularFish: Karma BatChest
[3:12:24] FeelsGoodStream: 1 ammo*
[3:12:48] AlphaTwinsLoL: Explain what happened
[3:12:53] maxozabojca99: @FeelsGoodStream when you press E, a text shows which gun is next, its pretty useless but it does so
[3:12:57] SingularFish: Ahri mejais curse
[3:13:08] influenya: auto consumes 1 ammo you mean?
[3:13:13] FeelsGoodStream: So if he uses up Blue(Flame gun) first here, then green (Sniper) then Flame will show up before Sniper once he works through rotation
[3:13:19] FeelsGoodStream: @influenya Yes
[3:13:26] Chipez: Hwei and aph are the only 2 champs i have no clue how to play
[3:13:41] FeelsGoodStream: Watch on his Q icon at the bottom, the number at the bottom is how much ammo it has left.
[3:14:23] FeelsGoodStream: The colored bar underneath Aphelios's mana bar also reflects how much ammo is left in that gun.
[3:14:23] influenya: ahhh @feelsgoodstream okay so whichever gun you finish first goes into the order so if the first rotation was blue then purple but you finish the purple one first then it will be purple then blue in the next rotation right?
[3:14:36] migueldelaho: !LEC2025
[3:14:36] Nightbot: I will go to LEC by 2025 or i retire from esports, mediocrity will not be tolerated, rank 1 and another eum win is coming.

[3:14:52] xDeekri: aatrox never played draven into tabis
[3:15:15] h0llw: losing 1 v1 to kayle as aatrox is wild
[3:15:26] 365Doors: @influenya there's a third coloured bar that matches the colour of his main weapon
[3:15:37] shiny00: @influenya theoretical will suck on this champ i recommend playing him or trying out urself in practice tool
[3:15:49] influenya: @365doors where?
[3:15:56] FeelsGoodStream: @influenya Yes, that's why you want to try and track your gun order and keep it in line as best you can. You can also start using gun expirations as a power move once you get advanced on the champion.
[3:16:10] influenya: @shiny00 yeah I think I will just trying to understand as I watch
[3:16:34] shiny00: cool
[3:16:35] FeelsGoodStream: @influenya It matches the color of the gun that he's using.
[3:16:39] influenya: @feelsgoodstream ahh okay so is the best order the order it comes with at the beginning
[3:17:01] FeelsGoodStream: @influenya No it requires shuffling to get the best order.
[3:17:05] influenya: I don’t see this bar haha
[3:17:09] FeelsGoodStream: !guns

[3:42:26] rapheelol: @PiyuSama how can he eat more hotdogs if he doesn't charge you a fair amount tho?
[3:42:39] Dirtycute: should be called a glizzy
[3:42:40] Ravileon: because they're only enjoyable when hot.
[3:42:56] halal_frozen_pork: pig is haram
[3:43:00] PiyuSama: @rapheelol  byee
[3:43:06] Kong_Jones: gg
[3:43:07] influenya: what is this quality
[3:43:14] Dirtycute: @halal_frozen_pork wait what about halal frozen pig?
[3:43:15] xcalebur: apparently its because people in the late 19th century thought they were made of dog meat
[3:43:18] SingularFish: Because the germans who invented glizzy's used dog meat
[3:43:29] halal_frozen_pork: @Dirtycute delicious
[3:43:39] reeiaa: The term dog has been used as a synonym for sausage since the 1800s, possibly from accusations that sausage makers used dog meat in their sausages
[3:43:56] dea1hwish: okay, can i be called hot dog because of.. monkaS
