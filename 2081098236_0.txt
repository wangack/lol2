[2:12:37] Amaresu_: real
[2:12:45] Chrisssan: do you prefer profrane rush now? or is this a situational build because of enemy team comp?
[2:12:54] lardyparty: uh oh smart player q
[2:12:54] akaiwii: ghosting, no??
[2:13:07] akaiwii: do u actually think he's not ghosting?
[2:13:18] noway4uong: Do you still go domination ?
[2:13:19] Amaresu_: nah he goes dirk into profane every game
[2:13:22] LordVipah: prolly warded
[2:13:32] theblindmonkkk: he seen him recalling obvious he's going to recall there
[2:13:32] akaiwii: yea maybe
[2:13:35] Flarezard: that movement wasnt ghosting at all
[2:13:41] Amaresu_: he went back to transcendence 2ndary after like the first couple weeks of testing on the season
[2:14:04] feedmaster07: or just scared?
[2:14:16] theblindmonkkk: also in that context the stream has to be at least delayed by 2 seconds
[2:14:34] Amaresu_: i think.. zed gets 100-0d in a shy combo if he doesnt ult the windslash, with these items and lvl 11
[2:14:49] Amaresu_: and i say shy combo cause of the active, better than doublecast
[2:15:06] erfwahr2q: agree do theShy combo
[2:15:12] PsychopathicTop: whats his ign
[2:15:23] PsychopathicTop: HAHAHA

[2:17:14] akaiwii: kiss dad on lips #NA1
[2:17:37] Amaresu_: you cant build defensive items cause you do no dmg.. you have to be 10-0 to be relevant and you cant lane for shit vs ranged AND you re a worse roamer than talon qiyana kat etc

[3:08:26] Ambiate_: ur riven is almost as clean as mine
[3:08:34] Amaresu_: and it helps you keep track of it when pushing towers cause they made riven passive work on towers too

[3:44:00] dhaboutnetenpremium: @Machyskoa U don't do enough damage with only shojin all in anymore to kill her
[3:44:11] GothRayleigh: @anirrech he just cant destroy towers so its really bad because a lot of people in piss-low dont attack towers when they can so smoulder gets me giga high Kd's but i cant force ends because my team would rather do baren when people have 45 seconds respawns when we have them all the way to their inhib
