[0:10:23] coubi: !build
[0:10:27] SzDredd: he still have it running LUL
[0:10:48] Bluichu: I believe in you RaccAttack
[0:10:58] SzDredd: ad = advertisment
[0:11:15] SzDredd: for smurf accounts
[0:11:40] SzDredd: he advertises smurf accounts site
[0:11:41] Breathe234: There are streamers that are sponsored by smurf account companies
[0:11:45] SzDredd: ipavHmm

[0:13:01] Bluichu: you can buy smurfs from those top streamers
[0:13:07] Bluichu: or something
[0:13:30] SzDredd: it is constantly on his OBS
[0:13:42] Bluichu: ^
[0:14:44] Breathe234: It must be a banner
[0:14:52] SzDredd: yeah it is a banner
[0:15:51] SzDredd: yup
[0:16:02] SzDredd: it is for smurf accounts company
[0:16:30] SzDredd: no idea
[0:16:40] SzDredd: he was a pro for a little too iirc
[0:17:14] Bluichu: that's what I thought, but I guess he's advertising it still
[0:17:15] Infinity_Angles: no riot watch him KEKW
[0:18:25] JustsomeWhitey: i think TFblade just has too big a following for Riot to do something
[0:18:30] JustsomeWhitey: is my opinion
[0:18:49] JustsomeWhitey: no i'm saying this is TFblade
[0:19:04] JustsomeWhitey: yeah Tyler1 has big following but he still makes new smurf accounts and continues
[0:19:20] JustsomeWhitey: they don't IP ban
[0:19:41] SzDredd: Tyler was a special case
[0:19:52] SzDredd: the moment they saw him stream or w/e - ban
[0:19:58] JustsomeWhitey: and since they don't IP Ban, they continue to promote these smurf account sites
[0:20:02] Infinity_Angles: that obs has been on his stream for like 1 years even more,if really something gonna happpen then it should be happened?
[0:20:10] DallinS: why are tf/tyler getting banned? smurfing?
[0:20:40] JustsomeWhitey: @DallinS they aren't getting banned, its just crazy that TFblade isn't cause his stream has ads for buying Smurf accounts right now
[0:21:03] DallinS: oh ok
[0:21:44] JustsomeWhitey: i like TF blade though, he's good player. Can get tilted sometimes but who doesn't
[0:21:58] JustsomeWhitey: but teemo players are always my #1
[0:22:28] DallinS: I think he's hilarious when he gets mad. he's always talking about what's going in the game. and yea he's mechanically very good
[0:23:04] Infinity_Angles: dont get 15 deaths beware of the auto ban monkaSHAKE
[0:23:38] trombonator420: @ipav999 hows terminus buff? maybe pushed it into at least being viable on taimo?
[0:23:43] JustsomeWhitey: lol he going crazy cause of the shield heal rn
[0:24:07] razer_mon: MONK EMMMM
[0:24:39] trombonator420: 6 auto instead of 10 for full stats
[0:25:42] JustsomeWhitey: were you trying out the Manco on hit build? or doing your own thing?
[0:26:09] trombonator420: @ipav999 defence from terminus is more of an addendum on top of something like jaksho and conditioning
[0:26:11] trombonator420: imo
[0:27:13] JustsomeWhitey: i plan to try the on-hit build tonight for taimo. looks fun
[0:28:27] trombonator420: @JustsomeWhitey just meaningless to do it if ur team is full AD
[0:28:57] JustsomeWhitey: @trombonator420 well yah, if too much AD then for sure not worth
[0:29:04] JustsomeWhitey: but its mixed dmg too
[0:29:11] trombonator420: tru
[0:31:02] JustsomeWhitey: i think the build is like bork, terminus, either frozen gaunlet or wits end next, liandrys, and then last item varies
[0:31:19] JustsomeWhitey: kinda interesting
[0:31:42] MoArRoCkEtS: lol. tf said his team is cringe. he wants to lose
[0:31:47] DallinS: jak and terminus seem good on paper together
[0:32:32] JustsomeWhitey: @DallinS yeah i think jaksho was an alternative too if you needed more magic resist
[0:32:36] JustsomeWhitey: for this teemo build

[3:44:09] twitchsuckstoday: la fabrica seems specific when its actually vague
[3:44:29] Silragy: "a" and "the"
[3:45:08] OpaqueColours: a=vague. the = specific
[3:45:11] twitchsuckstoday: I watch a teemo stream. I watch THE teemo stream.
[3:45:25] twitchsuckstoday: the teemo stream is ipav stream
[3:45:36] 514484: Estoy watchando el Teemo strim EZ
[3:45:41] jiapb: a teemo stream is manco
[3:45:49] jiapb: exactly
[3:45:56] bittenbygeraldine: Same as english, basically if it's generally a factory you say "a" factory, if it's for example the only factory in your area "the factory"  makes it clear without any further explanations
[3:45:59] Cosmikator: ipavHmm
[3:46:24] jiapb: so the factory implies you and whomever you are talking too know what factory you are speaking of. A factory if the person does not
[3:46:38] Silragy: my apologies. thanks to bitten for being not a dumbass for me
[3:47:19] jiapb: yessir you are very smart mr streamer you figured it out
[3:47:57] Silragy: yep
[3:47:57] bittenbygeraldine: yes, but it's not entertaining as narrating doki doki in spanish or mandarin XD

[3:49:02] bittenbygeraldine: tankmo vs WW, vayne, zyra? They all gonna build %HP XD
[3:49:06] 514484: they don't want to ult the tank now do they?
[3:55:37] YouAreCuteXD: ugh fuck gendered nouns
[3:56:19] twitchsuckstoday: ugh forget gender period!
[3:56:35] twitchsuckstoday: ipavToxic
[3:57:19] jeromefrance: If i remember good, ww R is coded as 5 AA and so it's blindable.
[3:57:45] Cosmikator: @AngryTeenMum you are not german! das= neutral der=male die=female
[3:58:31] neises: Das= divers

[3:59:43] YouAreCuteXD: 10 minute timeout seems excessive
[4:00:30] Aldurfus: @quetzalcozy Kappa
[4:00:38] Cosmikator: @YouAreCuteXD went rude mode - we are nontoxic here
[4:01:00] Matteigh: why use "." only sometimes?
[4:01:02] YouAreCuteXD: that's a very slight rudeness, and a 10 minute timeout
[4:01:03] twitchsuckstoday: ipavToxic
[4:01:13] jeromefrance: Ww on low economy suicide
[4:01:15] twitchsuckstoday: ipavHmm
[4:01:34] quetzalcozy: i... what does a high economy suicide look like?
[4:02:00] YouAreCuteXD: capitalism
[4:02:26] twitchsuckstoday: ipavWut NomNom love shrooms
[4:02:28] jeromefrance: @quetzalcozy peaceful farm vs nasus
[4:02:48] RishGameplays: @jeromefrance "Warwick Dash leaps in the target direction with crowd control immunity" you can blind it before R though
[4:04:37] jeromefrance: @R i'am sure you're right. I still remember blinding some ww, they dash but no visible dmg on the bar. Need to check it on wiki tho
[4:05:46] thehamad_: hahahahaha

[4:18:18] Cosmikator: lose streak beginning? ipavHmm
[4:20:31] Cosmikator: i think its not possible to compensate such bot gap
[4:23:42] Arbaya: When a word ends with the same letter the next word starts with
