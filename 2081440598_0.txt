[1:31:20] asvanh: ro jayce ain’t that hard
[1:31:25] niniwhxre: my bf played aphelios twice and was instantly good at him
[1:31:33] niniwhxre: and he told me: I don't find him hard
[1:31:40] niniwhxre: and I was like: you motherf-
[1:32:03] bman1058: Jayce is widely considered one of the harder champs in the game to play xC
[1:32:09] bman1058: XD*
[1:32:11] RedeemedRiku: hey zwag did you ever get that problem fixed with the $ on your zwagmo channel?
[1:32:12] asvanh: damn
[1:32:21] asvanh: never knew jayce was hard…
[1:32:24] rena_kittycat: @niniwhxre first and only time i played him i got like 12 kills
[1:32:37] niniwhxre: @rena_kittycat wtf- what rank?
[1:32:37] bman1058: His skill floor is easy to figure out, but his ceiling is insanely high
[1:33:15] niniwhxre: I mean yeah he's not hard to learn but he's hard to master
[1:33:33] rena_kittycat: i dunno, pretty sure was norms
[1:33:41] bman1058: Id say it's the opposite for aphelios
[1:33:49] asvanh: what philosophical speeches we make today
[1:33:54] rena_kittycat: but i got a double kill bot not knowing anything im doing
[1:33:57] asvanh: reallu *chef’s kiss*
[1:34:01] niniwhxre: idk, I'm drinking wine
[1:34:09] asvanh: that explains it
[1:34:13] bman1058: His floor is high for learning gun rotations and combos but besides that he's really simple once you learn his optimal rotations and how to fast swap guns to get optimal loadouts
[1:34:17] niniwhxre: I gotta say I did get a quadra with phel but I still don't consider myself good with him
[1:34:35] bman1058: I got a quad while 0/4 on Aphelios in a Zwag video after getting fisted in lane
[1:34:48] asvanh: @bman1058 xdd
[1:34:58] niniwhxre: ALSO ANOTHER CURSED THING, I GET QUADRAS WITH A LOT OF CHAMPS BUT NEVER THE PENTAS
[1:35:09] niniwhxre: @bman1058 oh yes I remember that
[1:35:14] ashweem1991: Ya it's hard when you don't have a great team
