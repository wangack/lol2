[2:47:45] SamIsHereNow: @jnyrb It does. People complain about tanks nonstop and it's not even a tank champion, lol. Just low elo players piping.

[2:48:51] jnyrb: @SamIsHereNow well juggernaut is based on the legacy classes fighter and tank. Classes are more defined by the items that are valid on them at the time imo. The problem isn't tanks, but voli is building tank in that game so people calling him a tank doesn't make them "low elo"
[2:48:51] Noooim: paidchatter
[2:48:52] jordanmon18: @riimose I think he meant at end of stream for tomorrow

[2:50:14] Waltuigi: 10
[2:50:16] quantumdodger: gotta go stimpack if you're going terran vs zerg
[2:50:21] jordanmon18: Them changing the map this season prob left alot of blind spots
[2:50:27] xg32: yes the grind is too slow
[2:50:33] Redfactor3: having to waste a run is so annoying
[2:50:38] Waltuigi: agree
[2:50:42] SamIsHereNow: @jnyrb That first statement is false and a champion's buildpath does not define their class. Not continuing this conversation. He's not a tank.
[2:50:47] xg32: bet it'll change b4 the 1.0 release
[2:51:09] PANICalaMODE: I found this game to be shallow
[2:51:13] TorqueBandit: is it a scam?
[2:51:14] Crabber: Lol

[2:54:51] CFN_TeeKay: @inopportune yea "parrrley"

[2:55:06] SamIsHereNow: @jnyrb There's no nuance to be had. You're factually wrong.

[2:57:12] theArambulance: when you point at gold to mark it in Deep Rock Galactic you say "WE'RE RICH" and it's extremely spammable, eventually the guy on comms says like "Yesssss, yessssss, you're rich, now get back to work"

[6:16:19] MedicOverHere: @ch3m15try the 75% crit? Its one of those things you gotta get lucky early on. There is an upgrade/artifact you can unlock that grants you 0.5% crit for every Nitra(the red currency) you have. Pair that with the artifact for getting a chance to gain nitra when mining; it becomes very easy to hit 100% critrate
