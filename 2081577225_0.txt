The game autoplays and if you win then you can type in chat any role/champ including off meta picks (Examples: AP Warwick, AP Nid Mid, Briar Top, Zyra Jungle)

The game autoplays and if you win then you can type in chat any role/champ including off meta picks (Examples: AP Warwick, AP Nid Mid, Briar Top, Zyra Jungle)

[3:00:44] Nightbot: Every Monday Pekin does Marble races to decide what his next champion pick is. All you have to do is type !play during the races to have a marble. The game autoplays and if you win then you can type in chat any role/champ including off meta picks (Examples: AP Warwick, AP Nid Mid, Briar Top, Zyra Jungle)

[3:32:56] Nightbot: Every Monday Pekin does Marble races to decide what his next champion pick is. All you have to do is type !play during the races to have a marble. The game autoplays and if you win then you can type in chat any role/champ including off meta picks (Examples: AP Warwick, AP Nid Mid, Briar Top, Zyra Jungle)

[5:34:00] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: classic "what a noob"
[5:34:04] troubble_bubble: !zwag
[5:34:04] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[5:34:10] pixeluwu: Nerdge "u bad bro"
