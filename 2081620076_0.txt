[0:26:00] shewasabulldozer: I watched dune last night. dune (1984) by David lynch. my mind melted
[0:26:05] Pita26: So many adaptations of Dune

[0:26:26] nfcpm: i just dont know the point of making the movie. I liked the 80s version fine
[0:26:29] milk_tea_way: My hot take is that Dune adaptation is exposing the dearth of media literacy of the general populace, at least the one haunting socmed.
[0:26:35] Kethous: this episode...
[0:26:37] Pita26: Looked good until that Dune take

[0:36:36] steph_curry_no1_fan: @voidspawn__ yes lets kill 2 leagues at once
[0:36:36] luxiibear: Are they prioritizing Val? That format for vct is awful....
[0:36:41] timd6210: @karonmoser you are super dope and pretty
[0:36:57] VeteranEU: wtf cubby has a servant?
[0:37:01] Kethous: lol
[0:37:03] WopaPlays: making the basement into an actual theme was nice
[0:37:03] the1andonlycorbin: LUL
[0:37:04] SirAstien: is the smaller room permanant?
[0:37:12] a_large_farvaaaa: cubby getting full service
[0:37:13] InfectiousRash: cubby livin large
[0:37:13] nfcpm: i felt they did message this.
[0:37:23] karlheinzstockfootage: neck tats were a bad idear nick
[0:37:26] ProteusWest: Rafaa is toweling Cubby off like 15 minutes into the show, how sweaty could he be by now?
[0:37:26] DirtyDogDaveTFT: @sirastien no they are back to normal this week
[0:37:28] urgotabekidding: I liked the cage match space
[0:37:29] PogoStomp: As a viewer I honestly thought the experience was fine.  I don't think the bigger studio really adds that much.
[0:37:33] urgotabekidding: honestly better than main stage
[0:37:36] i_play_viktor: What was valorant side of the compromise?
[0:37:39] nfcpm: I think Marz was pretty clear on that from the beginning
[0:37:41] dudeupstairs: As a viewer it was cool.
[0:37:42] Pita26: Is the entire lol reports budget going to Cubby's butler?
[0:37:45] xavgap: hey question for Inero, churros, cookie or pretzel?
[0:37:51] voidspawn__: @steph_curry_no1_fan Larger viewer base and player base, more budget, better production, freshness. whats not to like ?
[0:37:51] Pita26: **lol esports
[0:37:52] inero: churro
[0:38:01] WopaPlays: I feel like corporate speak never means any owning downsides on their decisions
[0:38:04] xavgap: @inero CarlSmile
[0:38:07] nfcpm: i think they were just trying to make the best of the situation
[0:38:13] cultLeader_: they did hide it until last minute
[0:38:14] the1andonlycorbin: I liked the look, it was a nice change of pace, but I also wouldn't want it all the time
[0:38:21] idoSptember: hey question for Inero, hairline for hairline with xav, who you got?
[0:38:22] Auixerre: they literally put League in a Cage...
[0:38:26] inero: xav
[0:38:26] boutakirk: well its just na league dying to be fair right
[0:38:31] karlheinzstockfootage: sorry the vc money tap got turned off
[0:38:31] ryannlauu: imagine being 30 and bald LUL
[0:38:40] pfwangers: @i_play_viktor why would they need to compromise if they were already scheduled for the space?
[0:38:41] Drazian: Inero, i just gotta say, you're my favorite bald man, please keep being awesome!
[0:38:43] xavgap: @ryannlauu stray bullets in chat
[0:38:48] a_large_farvaaaa: what’s valorant viewership at
[0:39:07] nfcpm: also as a viewer it was fine to me. I like an audience but I don't watch LCS to see randos in the crowd with witty messages.
[0:39:08] pausechamp52: MEOW
[0:39:11] steph_curry_no1_fan: @voidspawn__ theres no indication that an americas league would get a larger budget and better production, it would just lead to lower south american viewership because their teams would be watered down with less native talent
[0:39:18] luxiibear: I don't understand this conversation... Val had the space booked until they switched LCS back. Val literally were playing finals.
[0:39:25] Auixerre: Diehard is a good movie. And LCS weekends = LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts
[0:39:29] trollinn69: there’s a middle ground between lying and being too honest
[0:39:32] dudeupstairs: i think most viewers understand.
[0:39:41] i_play_viktor: outside of hardcore fans... who is left?
[0:39:42] imhei: at this point arent the hardcore fans the only ones left?
[0:39:48] PogoStomp: Given how concentrated down the LCS viewership has become, how many viewers at this point aren't "die hard"?
[0:39:53] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: relying on hardcore fan base has worked so well for LCS viewership so far
[0:39:56] karlheinzstockfootage: what's funny is i highly suspect cubby never got a taste of the vc money.  he'll be fine.
[0:39:58] WopaPlays: can we talk about the weird advertising skin drops and then like 3 people got hextech chests lmao
[0:40:00] trollinn69: just say “hey valorant already had the spot so we’ve gotta do this for a weekend”
[0:40:08] xavgap: @WopaPlays you have to DM @idoSptember for the code drops
[0:40:17] akshayhp1234: why did we take a 3 week break to still not get our spot
[0:40:18] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[0:40:20] nfcpm: the only think I was unclear on is why they didn't play there vs. have a break
[0:40:25] imhei: beef on deck
[0:40:32] idoSptember: just ran out, message @inero he still has 10 skins for the hotline league drop
[0:40:32] SwedeBeGoode: fun fact the I in @inero stands for "irate"
[0:40:36] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: yep, just give up on casual/new fans good plan
[0:41:05] fujimode: Kappa
[0:41:05] legendofivan: there are like 1.2 million ranked players in NA
[0:41:05] VerbalHorse: League isn't dying, worlds had the highest amount of viewers yet
[0:41:10] ProteusWest: they had to have a break anyways because they lost two teams, is my guess, if you want to keep the schedule similar to the timing of the other Leagues and MSI
[0:41:11] nfcpm: if league is dying they should fire everyone right now. it doesn't make sense to waste money on a dying product.
[0:41:20] VerbalHorse: It's LCS that's trending down, not the other elagues
[0:41:33] ProteusWest: so having the break during Valorant stuff makes sense
[0:41:44] karlheinzstockfootage: @ProteusWest riot usa took a break those weeks historically
[0:41:58] xavgap: favorite champion @inero ?
[0:42:03] Konnoke: Konnoke subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! #TLWIN
[0:42:03] inero: ashe
[0:42:07] xavgap: thx
[0:42:09] SirAstien: I bet like 50% of NA player base is due to Ppl with multiple accounts "smurfs"
[0:42:18] CaedClaxton: holy shit the community is reaping what the sowed. I've spent 7 years listening to the community and content shit on the game/NALCS/LCS and then they want to act surprised because there's a negative attitude on the game. no fucking shit.
[0:42:18] Japhy58: Japhy58 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[0:42:28] Auixerre: The kids are playing League. Tons of high schoolers are getting into it.
[0:42:38] akshayhp1234: @inero sup ashe or adc ashe?
[0:42:42] RaafaaCasts: @ProteusWest you'd be surprised how much moisture this human produces
[0:42:43] inero: sup ashe
[0:42:49] nfcpm: Riot sucks at messaging overall. whatever budget and people they have for it don't do enough of it and loud enough.
[0:42:53] xavgap: wow u are sup main?
[0:42:53] Andyyybarton: Mobas had a good run o7
[0:43:00] karlheinzstockfootage: this struggle session
[0:43:08] ProteusWest: @RaafaaCasts I produce a lot of moisture, but not sitting in a chair, does he have proper air conditioning?
[0:43:08] SirAstien: @Auixerre That's cap
[0:43:08] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: ur right they are not doing that but they should lol
[0:43:10] VeteranEU: this year they've given up yeah
[0:43:11] karlheinzstockfootage: whistling past the graveyard
[0:43:13] VeteranEU: hail valorant
[0:43:14] fujimode: qtcinderella my goat
[0:43:18] VeteranEU: ALL HAIL VALORANT
[0:43:21] ProteusWest: I'm just worried for Cubby's comfort :)
[0:43:26] idoSptember: @inero if all the GMs had to box, how far is Andrew Barton running the gauntlet
[0:43:46] nfcpm: do they advertise LCS during Valerant streams
[0:43:50] VerbalHorse: It's more so for viewer retention
[0:43:50] PogoStomp: I think they are trying to reverse negative sentiment
[0:43:51] RaafaaCasts: @ProteusWest its not the lack of ac, its him sweating from watching VODs of games before the hotline stream :)
[0:43:59] inero: @idoSptember i think he can hold his own
[0:44:04] ProteusWest: ahhh, that makes sense
[0:44:12] RaafaaCasts: @idoSptember big fan
[0:44:16] VerbalHorse: There are no casual fans, 1% of the playerbase watches the league
[0:44:18] whoa2you: I think that RIOT is being SUPER Innovative with Making LCS and NACL on Live patch. Mark Zee is literally listening to the Fan Base and theres no way taht the fans arent super entertained by that
[0:44:25] VerbalHorse: It's a niche within a niche
[0:44:53] Magnarius: Magnarius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 2 month streak! :)
[0:45:07] Ikancast: PogBones we have afk brazilians now
[0:45:10] VerbalHorse: If they want more viewers why not advertise in client to the player base
[0:45:12] ProteusWest: I've enjoyed everything they've done this split so far, but it feels like they're working against all the mistakes of the past and what Riot is willing to give them now
[0:45:19] a_large_farvaaaa: let inero cook
[0:45:23] karlheinzstockfootage: i feel bad for markzz.  he was forced to be the patsy for a really good show.
[0:45:26] fujimode: I think when Riot made the decision to move the LCS to the backrooms it seems they failed to consider how it would affect Lebron's legacy.
[0:45:27] legendofivan: LCS is good this year, other than the cave they're playing in
[0:45:28] razlol: imo the purpose of pushing live patch and focusing on patch notes + smolder ect is geared toward broader NA player base
[0:45:48] karlheinzstockfootage: but the lcs has degraded so much
[0:46:02] mojica100: Let's go Travis
[0:46:02] ProteusWest: @fujimode true
[0:46:09] xavgap: what a beautiful voice this @inero guy has

[0:46:44] travisgafford: is inero audio better
[0:46:45] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: how stupid do they think the teams are
[0:46:46] MattScoot2: inero sounds like hes underwater
[0:46:46] boutakirk: gaslighting

[0:47:01] fujimode: @travisgafford its good he just sounds like bane a little bit
[0:47:04] VerbalHorse: Inero sounds like he just found out some one was cheating on him and lieing to his faxce LUL
[0:47:05] ProteusWest: DGon was doing an interview with Vulcan and his chair was broken

[0:47:16] urgotabekidding: @MattScoot2 drowning in testosterone :D
[0:47:18] a_large_farvaaaa: inero sounds like he’s holding a bong rip in
[0:47:18] dropsofliquid: @ProteusWest Hahahahaha
[0:47:19] karlheinzstockfootage: peter guber jettisoned the golden guardians.
[0:47:20] red_05_: RIOT does not care about LEAGUE anymore!!!
[0:47:22] ryannlauu: valorant also got this super nice artwork in the back of the studio and league has nothing LUL
[0:47:27] scrapabidoopimpaff: @ProteusWest that was so funny lmao
[0:47:31] nfcpm: so why havent they been working on it before that moment
[0:47:31] fujimode: If LCS needs a venue I have a 500sqft studio in Seattle so tell MarkZ to hit me up if interested!
[0:47:46] SirAstien: FPS are boring to watch
[0:47:53] ProteusWest: I mean, it was just emblematic of everything Inero was saying, it's not like we can't all see it too
[0:47:58] urgotabekidding: I'd be curious to know how much less expensive the back stage was.  I liked it...maybe we go back stage and do 3 days/week :D
[0:48:00] embw: A wins a win baby
[0:48:11] nfcpm: a 2-0 is a 2-0
[0:48:27] VerbalHorse: APA call tonight Prayge
[0:48:35] karlheinzstockfootage: the c9 tl game was such a fiesta
[0:48:40] ProteusWest: did DSG beat LIT?
[0:48:41] Andyyybarton: FQ #1 in NACL lets go
[0:48:49] ProteusWest: I didn't get a chance to stick around and watch it
[0:49:05] a_large_farvaaaa: geng vs t1 who’s taking the dub
[0:49:06] numiiigoesrawrz: hi nadrew
[0:49:06] queenofcarmel: Are they back in the cage this weekend?
[0:49:09] Pita26: @karlheinzstockfootage clown fiesta!
[0:49:18] karlheinzstockfootage: so b03s are still a bad idea?
[0:49:26] ProteusWest: I wanted to because Kangas used the word Kangulations
[0:49:41] SevTST: How does the league just come back and we're straight back to doom? Lol
[0:49:41] PapaSmithy: @Andyyybarton I miss nightfiend.
[0:49:48] karlheinzstockfootage: @a_large_farvaaaa geng
[0:49:51] nfcpm: oh no
[0:50:06] linuscalling: Best of 2. Let's go!!!!
[0:50:08] nfcpm: i gave your Bo3 video a thumbs up

[0:50:23] Pita26: It's the part of the show when Travis tells us we don't know the
[0:50:30] Pita26: **what we want
[0:50:31] SirAstien: F bomb
[0:50:32] slumdo666: lets be honest. the data behind what ur saying is over 7 years old
[0:50:34] PhoenixTheFiery: the best of threes video backlash was so crazy
[0:50:39] embw: Best of 2s for regular season is the best
[0:50:40] slumdo666: Bo3s deserve another shot
[0:50:42] dudeupstairs: I liked it
[0:50:48] dropsofliquid: Really? I saw a lot of people enjoying it but just still wanting bo3
[0:50:51] ProteusWest: I would take some Valorant style promo and relegation to get back to 10 teams and keep best of 1s, thank you
[0:50:52] SirAstien: @embw 100%
[0:50:55] WrathOfKon: You had a lot of great points on why double round robin best of 3 can not work at all
[0:50:56] Ikancast: the bo1 supporters will ddos you until you accept their format
[0:50:56] imhei: problem is that ANY more games than we are getting than now would be better so if you oppose best of 3 it just looks like you oppose more games in general
[0:50:59] VeteranEU: ye my bad, i didnt watch the video i was just following the crowd in comments
[0:51:00] Cubbyxx: !discord
[0:51:00] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[0:51:08] VeteranEU: i dont even like BO3
[0:51:14] SirAstien: I want Fearless Bo2's
[0:51:23] nfcpm: if they games continue to take 40+ minutes a best of 3 will take weeks
[0:51:26] BadgerJahr: BadgerJahr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! Baked takes only!
[0:51:32] urgotabekidding: LCS should've gone with 3 split format and set up a mini tournament between the top two LEC/LCS teams between winter and spring
[0:51:43] Babyd72: 2 teams best of 7, 4 days of week sotlThinking
[0:51:46] karlheinzstockfootage: well they eliminated b03s's 7 years ago, lcs is so much more healthy now.  lck and lpl are suffering so much.
[0:52:20] ProteusWest: @karlheinzstockfootage poster child for correlation is not causation, right here
[0:52:23] dudeupstairs: Travis's acting in the beginning was great.
[0:52:26] nfcpm: LCS is doing a Thurs, Fri, Sat Sunday for playoffs. so they can do it
[0:52:39] the1andonlycorbin: the1andonlycorbin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:52:44] ixbx: is a huge bummer that LCS has never given Bo3 a chance
[0:52:45] BeepImaJeep2015: LUL
[0:53:02] igmatats: BO3.. Teams play from their own HQ on Thursday/Friday. In studio Sat/Sun? Might be doable

[0:53:19] PapaSmithy: monkaS Inero on this episode after we did this in 2021
[0:53:19] linuscalling: Rochester MN...the San Diego of the North!
[0:53:21] ProteusWest: didn't we basically do that in 2021?
[0:53:22] OG_Plumwick: msi modCheck
[0:53:23] embw: Oh no, not the T-sports call
[0:53:24] Andyyybarton: We ddi that, was kinda weird
[0:53:26] vilhelmq: Just no
[0:53:27] aequorin628: So no playoffs halfway though?
[0:53:27] cultLeader_: it didn't go that well last time
[0:53:30] HexBlast: Tried it, people don't like starting summer with spring record
[0:53:36] dropsofliquid: @linuscalling Is San Diego a medical city?
[0:53:39] ixbx: @SwedeBeGoode trikHeart
[0:53:41] nfcpm: hard for teams to fire players and coaches if it is a season long
[0:53:44] grandezelx: Wtf
[0:53:45] I_Saika: Lamo it didn't went well
[0:53:47] PatLevels: This guy was not here when we tried it. Massive failure
[0:53:48] ixbx: @SwedeBeGoode Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:53:49] Babyd72: but then doublelift wont be able to tell us spring split doesnt matter :(
[0:53:55] Auixerre: i like having more champions...and more MVPs
[0:53:56] WrathOfKon: How about instead of one long continuous season the esport was one shorter NFL type season. 1 split and worlds, thats it
[0:54:07] VerbalHorse: The LEC playoffs just got the 800K viewers, seems 3 splits is better tbh
[0:54:07] ThexCatmanx: How would we pick who to send to MSI? Like a tourney?
[0:54:10] InfectiousRash: i think i agree with that
[0:54:11] SwedeBeGoode: @ixbx you've paid it forward in advance <3
[0:54:12] nfcpm: how do they choose who goes to MSI
[0:54:21] HexBlast: If you want bo3 copy eu's format instead of round robin
[0:54:24] Jeankof: wasn't 2021 essentially that, didn't the record carry over to summer
[0:54:24] SirAstien: They won't ever bring ONE season back because of CLG ace season
[0:54:25] linuscalling: @dropsofliquid San Fran is. The weather in MN has been San Diego like.
[0:54:25] ixbx: 3 splits seems to be the future path

[0:54:29] app1ethief: sotlThinking
[0:54:30] P4llace: 2021?
[0:54:35] Seanatonin_: But what if we like just play more games
[0:54:38] WrathOfKon: @VerbalHorse LEC viewership gain IMO is not format based but the fanbases from ERLS coming in and boosting it.
[0:54:43] karlheinzstockfootage: btw lec is suicidal having three seasons.  where teams disappear faster.  they are lemmings chasing the lcs
[0:54:50] ProteusWest: yeah, that was Niles in spring
[0:54:54] dropsofliquid: @linuscalling My mom sent me a video of snow in MN today :D
[0:54:58] WrathOfKon: @Seanatonin_ Sadly there is no money for that with broadcasting costs
[0:55:00] SwedeBeGoode: @ixbx stop i didnt gift the sub for you to hurt me like this
[0:55:04] Niles: best roster ever
[0:55:05] shewasabulldozer: GOAT rodter
[0:55:08] urgotabekidding: @karlheinzstockfootage chasing the LCS with...a completely different format and better viewership?
[0:55:08] VerbalHorse: @WrathOfKon But the finals was the 800K peak, with LCS viewership that game is another BO1 that gets a quarter of those views
[0:55:08] shewasabulldozer: roster
[0:55:09] slumdo666: @karlheinzstockfootage LEC format is a crime against humanity
[0:55:12] Niles: that roster gets too much hate.
[0:55:16] shewasabulldozer: @niles amen to that
[0:55:17] Tbone_1337: 2021 was the full year season because it was the Coach Bjergsen season
[0:55:20] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[0:55:25] Pita26: That's actually better
[0:55:32] inero: @Niles fr
[0:55:33] steph_curry_no1_fan: the same niles that good cooked by tyler1?
[0:55:38] inero: was good times
[0:55:38] VerbalHorse: Having a BO5 finals is just better than BO1's over and over again
[0:55:39] ProteusWest: it was a tough situation for that roster for sure
[0:55:49] WrathOfKon: @VerbalHorse The finals were 800K because a spanish community built team made finals. It's less to do with anything format wise.
[0:55:49] ixbx: @SwedeBeGoode oof sorry sorry I did not mean to wound
[0:56:05] grandezelx: Wtf
[0:56:06] OhHaiVegA: @inero we are visiting cali in a month or so we gotta get up ill dm you
[0:56:10] メフィスト: i hate this guy
[0:56:14] inero: hmu brother
[0:56:14] PogoStomp: the tournaments are the most fun part.
[0:56:15] Auixerre: Um. Worlds is the happiest time of the year.
[0:56:19] BeepImaJeep2015: Olympics style every 4 years LUL
[0:56:20] grandadmiralneckbeard: tbh, I would rather have a single round robin of Bo3 over two rounds of Bo1's, because Bo1's just suck imo
[0:56:24] grandezelx: The caller should not have opinions
[0:56:25] toshiro_uzumaki: Hey Travis, can you start like a monthly viewer league tournament where people who sign up who are viewers. They put their rank and role in the sign ups. You select captains and pick teams. have it casted :)
[0:56:27] nfcpm: the ols SC2 system
[0:56:27] VerbalHorse: @WrathOfKon So the format creating a bo5 has nothing to do with viewership? What if it was FNC, or BDS, or KC thast mae finals same excuse right
[0:56:31] Jeankof: so top 2 in standings would go msi? or are suggesting just copy and paste 2021
[0:56:33] SwedeBeGoode: @ixbx It's alright, I still love you
[0:56:44] Snitzel13: is inero on the phone rn
[0:56:46] shewasabulldozer: Yuki Tsunoda clears
[0:56:47] grandezelx: This caller should get a brain
[0:56:48] inero: ye
[0:56:49] JakeandJoelareMagic: travis what are you eating
[0:56:57] VeteranEU: globalism is killing league
[0:56:59] Seanatonin_: Is Inero in the room with us rn
[0:57:03] inero: no
[0:57:06] nfcpm: 2+ 1 in Saudi Arabia
[0:57:09] yuuji4: Inero looksmaxxing on stream GigaChad
[0:57:11] VeteranEU: flat earth theory will save league of legends
[0:57:19] whoa2you: Splits are not a problem.... Why are we trying to "fix" a non-[roblem?
[0:57:20] karlheinzstockfootage: does inero have phoneor a face vibrator
[0:57:24] ProteusWest: @VeteranEU agreed, we need to get rid of Korea and China and it'd be way more competitive
[0:57:25] inero: it's a heater
[0:57:28] Niles: inero looksmaxxing on stream GigaChad
[0:57:51] i_play_viktor: if we dont have a playoff we could fint in atleast 1 more round robin
[0:57:52] Seanatonin_: @VeteranEU  The anticipation of the flat earth theory is better than the actual theory
[0:58:06] WrathOfKon: I think from a NA perspective I do think the emphasis on international events has disincentive a lot of casual NA fans from watching regional lolesports. They wait for international tournaments instead
[0:58:08] dropsofliquid: I think I can't even watch finals this year :(

[0:58:23] urgotabekidding: LEC format > LCS system
[0:58:25] VeteranEU: @Seanatonin_ that makes it perfect for international NA performances
[0:58:28] boutakirk: not a fan of the lec format personally
[0:58:32] Seanatonin_: exactly
[0:58:33] dropsofliquid: What's king of the hill format
[0:58:42] vilhelmq: LEC doesn't exactly seem to be positively affected by the format change, though, no?
[0:58:42] BeepImaJeep2015: King of the hill LUL. Everyone plays G2 until G2 loses
[0:58:45] inero: @Niles mind the jawline
[0:58:47] Ian7j2: I hate LEC format it's so confusing. I stopped watching LEC because of it
[0:58:49] Jeankof: everyone's just going to start zoning out Lcs if it's a full year of bo1's with just playoffs in the end
[0:58:51] urgotabekidding: with 8 teams LCS could just throw everyone into "playoffs" with the single RR for seeding
[0:58:54] karlheinzstockfootage: lrc winter season means nothing by the time we get to worlds
[0:58:55] Seanatonin_: @inero are you mewing?
[0:59:01] karlheinzstockfootage: *lec
[0:59:02] HexBlast: Lec format is the best way to get bo3s
[0:59:09] iamelvis4: LEC format has lead me to never watch LEC
[0:59:11] ProteusWest: LEC feels like a lot of it doesn't really matter in terms of qualification for worlds
[0:59:15] ThexCatmanx: Whatever they decide, all I know is 14 game seasons are pretty weak. How can the players level up when they play 1/5 the games most other regions play?
[0:59:26] nfcpm: as a knicks fan it sucked
[0:59:30] Mounizle: he's still muted for us as well
[0:59:30] OhHaiVegA: i do think its a big issue we dont give players accomplishments historical context, like when plays are having great seasons how it stacks up vs all tiem grats etc.
[0:59:31] urgotabekidding: @karlheinzstockfootage if LCS had a winter season and we then did top two NA vs top two EU it would be hype for fans and make winter matter
[0:59:33] dropsofliquid: @iamelvis4 Same I start in spring then lose track of everything & never catch up
[0:59:42] whoa2you: @Seanatonin_ How on Earth does a Flat Earth Theory or its anticipation have anything to do with...well...anything...?
[0:59:46] WrathOfKon: LEC format is meh. Keep it away
[0:59:46] karlheinzstockfootage: the lakers won the last championship for kobe
[0:59:51] P4llace: LMFAO
[0:59:53] Seanatonin_: @whoa2you you wouldn't get it
[1:00:07] ProteusWest: @whoa2you he's trolling :)
[1:00:08] Tameablebread93: people think the earth is round?
[1:00:16] Ikancast: i prefer league format over tournaments

[1:00:26] Auixerre: Making sports brackets help
[1:00:32] karlheinzstockfootage: nba in season tournament has no stakes, no one knows who won
[1:00:32] nfcpm: tournaments are only fun if your team is in it
[1:00:38] Seanatonin_: There is a reason that DBZ does Tournaments almost every time
[1:00:39] urgotabekidding: can we turn inero up like 5-10%
[1:00:40] HexBlast: Single round Robin bo1 for seeding in a bo3 double elimination tournament
[1:00:40] Jeankof: yes
[1:00:47] OhHaiVegA: yeah we already have that
[1:00:47] whoa2you: @ProteusWest This WHOLE conversation is irritating the crap out of me.... It just feels like Fake News.... I apologize for being ANGRY!
[1:00:48] Tunatoogood: When 6/8 teams make playoffs no one cares about regular season games
[1:00:50] nfcpm: lakers won
[1:00:51] SevTST: I mean... It's MSI.
[1:00:51] Almnast: that's why the nfl can get away with 17 game season every game matters so much
[1:00:52] Ikancast: right now valorant feels so useless because of kickoff tournament. waiting for the actual season to start still
[1:01:14] gurg7: they used regular season games as like tournament games
[1:01:14] ProteusWest: @whoa2you well played
[1:01:20] nfcpm: you played 2 games vs teams in your bracket
[1:01:22] Jeankof: so it just turns into lec format? bo1s into groups into playoffs KEKW
[1:01:24] gurg7: then the teams in finals were the only ones with additional games
[1:01:28] Seanatonin_: ^ @Cubbyxx
[1:01:37] Cubbyxx: @gurg7 Yes
[1:01:38] BigAngryHobo: BigAngryHobo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 69 months, currently on a 69 month streak! nice
[1:01:39] GrizBB: nba tourney only works cause of big purse up top, would riot put money toward prize pool?
[1:01:46] Cubbyxx: But your record going in only mattered for the pools you were drawn into
[1:01:49] urgotabekidding: @GrizBB doubt
[1:01:51] karlheinzstockfootage: i just hope lebron and bronnie can team up for 100T in fall
[1:01:53] WrathOfKon: you think winning  your region would be high enough stakes
[1:02:01] Tameablebread93: MSI is good because we get anice midseason reminder how bad LEC is :)
[1:02:06] PogoStomp: and the MSI format is good so having your favorite team go is more interesting
[1:02:20] ProteusWest: I kind of like the idea of having fewer 4 seeds at Worlds, personally, I miss having the whole World scene involved in the main stage
[1:02:25] urgotabekidding: @WrathOfKon you'd think NBA players making millions wouldn't care about the small prize pool for the in season tournament..but they did
[1:02:29] linuscalling: I want whatever format makes LCS world winners. America loves winners. That would save the LCS.
[1:02:30] HexBlast: We need more playoffs not less
[1:02:46] karonmoser: Yeah viewership always down in summer is a good point I don't see brought up enough thanks @travisgafford !
[1:02:57] Seanatonin_: Yeah viewership always down in summer is a good point I don't see brought up enough thanks @travisgafford
[1:02:58] WrathOfKon: @urgotabekidding competitors love to compete.
[1:03:00] karlheinzstockfootage: viewership is always down year on year for lcs.  for 7 years, prolly b03 failt
[1:03:06] urgotabekidding: @linuscalling do it like baseball/football/basketball etc and claim that you're world champions because you won the US league :D
[1:03:07] OhHaiVegA: but what if i want is viewership
[1:03:23] GrizBB: @urgotabekidding Bron & starters were working for big payday for bench guys, huge for them
[1:03:31] i_play_viktor: why would the lcs make major changes when things are going so well
[1:03:40] Auixerre: 100% Stage Design and LCS Production this year. LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts
[1:03:42] Tameablebread93: def made the best of a tough situation
[1:03:46] VeteranEU: I think the only way to secure a decent NA placement at Worlds is nuclear warfare
[1:03:48] grandadmiralneckbeard: @linuscalling No format is going to suddenly fix all of the other things that hinder NA's ability to compete, chief of which is the lack of a dedicated player-base to generate players
[1:03:54] urgotabekidding: I liked cage match stage design. I vote to keep it perma
[1:04:04] Tameablebread93: it really was pretty cool
[1:04:17] karonmoser: LOL Shoutout to Travis his job sucks
[1:04:22] urgotabekidding: the pre-game trash talk was fantastic
[1:04:22] ThexCatmanx: Uh oh. Someone said the J word
[1:04:25] Ian7j2: HE USED THE J WORD
[1:04:29] JinnAxel: pepelaugh Travis being called a journalist
[1:04:31] Seanatonin_: Journalist Travis Gafford
[1:04:37] danada389: having a staring contest with Kelsey rn
[1:04:42] iamelvis4: *not a journalist
[1:04:54] SevTST: Either Kelsey is frozen or she does not blink.
[1:04:57] app1ethief: sotlThinking sotlThinking
[1:05:03] JinnAxel: Travis "I'm not a journalist" Gafford
[1:05:07] GodzillaGuerilla: *or else certain manchilds somewhere will get offended and make a 3 hour podcast about it
[1:05:09] a_large_farvaaaa: lol
[1:05:10] P4llace: @karonmoser yo yo !
[1:05:22] app1ethief: uhoh
[1:05:23] BigAngryHobo: Travis doesn't even call out my 69 months resub how dare him lol
[1:05:33] SwedeBeGoode: SwedeBeGoode gifted a Tier 1 sub to karonmoser! They have given 159 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:05:38] urgotabekidding: I think FQ crushed the break with that event
[1:05:39] karlheinzstockfootage: tonight is my bday.  can i get a sub from my experimental music pun fans?
[1:05:44] Seanatonin_: is he eating his mic?
[1:05:51] nfcpm: i agree all the teams and riot wasted the break. (except flyquest)
[1:05:53] app1ethief: sotlMic sotlMic sotlMic
[1:05:55] inero: @karlheinzstockfootage happy bday boss
[1:05:56] HexBlast: Pros don't wanna do random stuff during the season other than practice
[1:05:59] slumdo666: @bigangryhobo nice
[1:06:01] JinnAxel: Is this a challengers diss call?
[1:06:09] ProteusWest: I definitely felt like the three week break was something they didn't expect to have
[1:06:10] Tameablebread93: not wrong tbh
[1:06:19] GrizBB: valo takes priority rip
[1:06:21] dropsofliquid: I agree but idk how much of that was TL not putting much out
[1:06:22] nfcpm: riot or the teams
[1:06:22] Konnoke: Blame Markz for baiting us
[1:06:30] Tameablebread93: I mean they did have a bit of content
[1:06:36] WrathOfKon: I would of loved a video series in the break where each team talks about their favorite game or one important game from the first half the split.
[1:06:36] Tameablebread93: FLY mostly ya
[1:06:41] ProteusWest: C9 organized some ARAMS with their players
[1:06:44] ProteusWest: on their Discord
[1:06:47] vilhelmq: C9 did too
[1:06:51] the1andonlycorbin: C9 put out some stuff and did Arams
[1:06:52] PogoStomp: what do you mean Kobe and Flower casted the NACL....
[1:06:57] Auixerre: FlyQuest killed it during the break
[1:06:59] dropsofliquid: It was pretty fun to watch
[1:07:01] karlheinzstockfootage: flyquest took three stranded euros and 2 rookies
[1:07:01] Ikancast: nrg also did arams
[1:07:04] SirAstien: they did do the LCS Challengers co stream with kobe and captflowers
[1:07:05] nfcpm: and they had top tier casters for the fly event
[1:07:06] JinnAxel: Didn't the LCS channel co stream Challengers?
[1:07:06] dropsofliquid: NRG did Thursday night ARAM or something too
[1:07:07] Auixerre: IMT also organized ARAMs on discord, btw
[1:07:07] Padlin: oh man i never get to watch this show live! i'm in europe
[1:07:12] Ian7j2: I watched the flyquest thing it was cool
[1:07:14] メフィスト: what did fly quest do
[1:07:20] Padlin: i can watch now because i decided to get drunk and stay up late
[1:07:20] Tameablebread93: ARAMS is so low effort that does not count
[1:07:21] whoa2you: Jesus - RIOT LCS content is literally free to us viewers and someone is bitching that the Free entertainment disappeared for a few weeks....
[1:07:47] urgotabekidding: @メフィスト 3 game show match with their challengers players, with the last two games being captain pick players for mixed teams
[1:07:53] Auixerre: @Tameablebread93 Hard disagree. It's a way to connect and play with the pros. Low pressure so it's something and they are spending their time with fans. #fanengagement
[1:07:53] aequorin628: Fly said they weren't allowed to play other LCS teams right?
[1:07:56] Tameablebread93: I think it's extremely reasonable to critique the LCS strategy
[1:08:01] Karpeezy: I'm really good The Dive and Speaking with the Pros were still released weekly
[1:08:01] ProteusWest: teams always prioritize the competitive side over the content side
[1:08:01] Ikancast: @メフィスト show match with their two rosters and changing lineups to different combinations between games
[1:08:08] Andyyybarton: @aequorin628 correct
[1:08:10] urgotabekidding: @aequorin628 I'd imagine interteam games would've been a no-no
[1:08:13] PogoStomp: @whoa2you someone is reasonably stating that it's disappointing
[1:08:14] Jeankof: 100Thieves can't afford to reserve a bowling lane, they ain't gonna spend money on content LUL
[1:08:16] Tameablebread93: @Auixerre I just mean more it's very localized to specific people, not the wider scene.
[1:08:20] Seanatonin_: I think an NA All star break thing would've been fun..   have fans vote for new players and old players alike..    Rookies vs sophmores or Rookies vs Retired vets
[1:08:22] PapaSmithy: @aequorin628 ya we pitched some interregion/other competitive stuff but not allowed
[1:08:24] メフィスト: didnt hear about it at all and i check reddit pretty religiously
[1:08:25] karlheinzstockfootage: flyquest removed the ovilee video curse and got a cheap team
[1:08:27] Padlin: break was lame and weirdly timed
[1:08:28] dropsofliquid: I thought it was just a one weekend break until I watched an APA stream lol
[1:08:34] ixbx: they kept putting out 'the dive' what more do you want from them!?
[1:08:36] thee_mastergen: @whoa2you we arent complaining about free entertainment leaving we are saying if there is nothing to do for 3 weeks why not make something happen
[1:08:41] whoa2you: @PogoStomp Its fricking FREE - How about being grateful and stating that we cant wait for more...?
[1:08:46] メフィスト: the dive was great
[1:08:47] urgotabekidding: And most LCS teams don't have challenger teams anymore :D
[1:08:54] Auixerre: @Tameablebread93 Ahh. Gotcha. Do you have any ideas of what they could have done?
[1:08:58] PapaSmithy: ya can do 1v1's/2v2's just not comp 5v5s
[1:08:59] Ikancast: PogBones mundo dodgeball
[1:09:07] urgotabekidding: a 1v1 tournament would've been cool
[1:09:09] Tameablebread93: ITS FREE = you can't comment on viability or intelligence of the approach because its free
[1:09:11] razlol: there could've been 1v1 tournaments like C9 did King of the hill event a while back
[1:09:14] whoa2you: @thee_mastergen There is literally a WHOLE WIDE WORLD out there! There is NEVER nothing to do........
[1:09:14] julianlearning: THAT'S WJHAT I USED TO DO
[1:09:15] SirAstien: showmatch with LLA team
[1:09:15] SwedeBeGoode: @ixbx we're so gosh darn entitled
[1:09:17] razlol: The reality is teams didnt want to do it
[1:09:17] PogoStomp: @whoa2you my bad fed the troll
[1:09:17] GrizBB: would orgs make money doing all star game type stuff?
[1:09:28] razlol: Saying teams weren't allowed to play eachother to me is a cop out
[1:09:34] BigAngryHobo: Hi Raz
[1:09:36] SevTST: @razlol ^
[1:09:40] ProteusWest: it sounded like teams spent time scrimming
[1:09:48] urgotabekidding: @razlol they needed a break after a brutal schedule of *checks notes* 9 games
[1:09:49] BigAngryHobo: Loved the most recent episode of Pros
[1:09:52] razlol: Props to Fly it was a fun event
[1:09:56] kudo_1: brand building for pro player and org is a two way street
[1:10:02] Padlin: yeah fly event was cool
[1:10:03] dadsimonkayle: Cubby are you still pulling takes? I just got here.
[1:10:08] Padlin: and i like fly players more this year
[1:10:10] SirAstien: LLA team woulda coulda  and shoulda "Scrimmed/showmatched"
[1:10:14] thoughtfulcoconut: a lot of younger players have horrible branding too

[1:10:24] SevTST: The Fly event was fun to anyone who actually watched it. Lol
[1:10:27] GrizBB: whos making money on 1v1 sunday tourney
[1:10:28] imhei: i think rather than positional coaches or actual coaches - these teams should literally be marketing agencies for the players
[1:10:28] whoa2you: @PogoStomp Im seriously not trolling. Im tired of how everyone is bitching about ... well ...  nothing...
[1:10:38] urgotabekidding: I dunno, FQ made their event HELLA fun to watch with high level production values tbh (overlay was better than LCS overlay)
[1:10:42] daisydupe23: omg can pro players do anything alone
[1:10:44] shewasabulldozer: fly event was A tier
[1:10:44] vilhelmq: @thoughtfulcoconut Yeon is great, but it isn't really displayed
[1:10:51] Jeankof: corejj in-house with casters is probably the best we could do outside of Fly
[1:10:56] SevTST: It'd have been nice if maybe the LCS channel carried team events as well, but I dunno if that teams wanted that.

[1:11:03] VeteranEU: @imhei they literally should be yeah, they're just really, really dumb
[1:11:04] c9_bobby: aite i tried to get OG C9 vs current C9 i swear
[1:11:06] メフィスト: dig had content but honestly the players come off as pretty boring most of the time
[1:11:11] Padlin: wtf is inero rubbign on his face
[1:11:17] razlol: @c9_bobby <3
[1:11:17] Padlin: @VeteranEU why are you awake
[1:11:18] karlheinzstockfootage: inspired sat on the bench, bwipo and jensen sat on the bench, this was cheap talent who was in na.
[1:11:20] CoyoteNA: All-stars matter compared to a random sunday
[1:11:21] a_large_farvaaaa: I wouldn’t mind watching the players box each other
[1:11:23] MacDaAce: I love king of the hill
[1:11:24] PapaSmithy: @c9_bobby that would've been fun!
[1:11:26] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:11:28] ProteusWest: @c9_bobby that would have been popular
[1:11:29] WrathOfKon: Dig probably could have if they brought in people from their fortnite side that are content creators that are just good casters
[1:11:32] Andyyybarton: TGI should have hosted the 1v1 tournament
[1:11:34] VeteranEU: @Padlin because i am not asleep
[1:11:39] CoyoteNA: 1v1ing faker compared to 1v1ing your mid
[1:11:40] inero: @Padlin hand warmer
[1:11:40] c9_bobby: but balls isn't local :(
[1:11:40] Padlin: @VeteranEU truism isn't cool
[1:11:41] inero: it's cold
[1:11:46] urgotabekidding: @SevTST I wonder if that's a missing piece that could help viewership overall, have more stuff going on on the LCS twitch channel not just weekend games
[1:11:46] iamelvis4: half the players sign up???
[1:11:47] whoa2you: @c9_bobby HOLY CRAP! Now that would be SUPER entertaining!!!!
[1:11:52] SirAstien: 2v2v2v2 tournament woulda been fun
[1:11:53] ProteusWest: I think it would be depressing to watch OG C9 get crapped on a little, but it would have been fun
[1:11:53] Ikancast: maybe they could have opened CQ up and we could watch that!
[1:11:57] urgotabekidding: like hosting streams and stuff like that
[1:11:59] karlheinzstockfootage: btw wherer is closer?
[1:12:06] aequorin628: That's a great idea
[1:12:07] Seanatonin_: @razlol give me an NBA All star weekend thing for LCS during the break
[1:12:07] razlol: like to me, the C9 king of the hill was really cool and built player brands. Any team could've done that
[1:12:12] ProteusWest: if Balls isn't local, you just find Dyrus or make Doublelift play Vayne top
[1:12:16] toshiro_uzumaki: they should do an LCS Arena 2v2v2v2 tournament lol
[1:12:19] ProteusWest: or ask Darshan
[1:12:20] Seanatonin_: Like the Red Bull 1v1 Tourney ?
[1:12:20] Satvai: could have had a caster vs caster game
[1:12:23] Jeankof: Sion speedway bed making thing last year was solid side content
[1:12:23] SevTST: @urgotabekidding I'm just wondering if that would take away from the actual Org channels though, and they wouldn't wanna give away the traffic.
[1:12:32] Tameablebread93: Teams don't understand long term company viability imo
[1:12:33] CoyoteNA: have team go community in-houses with casters
[1:12:37] julianlearning: im tilted
[1:12:38] imhei: teams should just be hype-men for the players. coaches are overrated.
[1:12:43] Ikancast: @Jeankof i also liked that
[1:12:48] MattySocials: indeed
[1:12:51] urgotabekidding: @SevTST for the FQ event multiple other channels were going, like Captain Flowers. They, at least, were OK with it
[1:12:52] starlitspirit: the LCK is doing some content called WHO R U MAN which is basically a 1v1 tournament where the players are disguised so it is a fun guessing game too
[1:13:00] Padlin: @inero face warner too ig
[1:13:04] urgotabekidding: particularly since it was a charity event so more eyes the better
[1:13:07] starlitspirit: i think it would be fun for LCS to do something like WHO R U MAN
[1:13:08] inero: @Padlin YES!
[1:13:19] karlheinzstockfootage: @Tameablebread93 teams are poor, they needed vc money.  huni could never get 2 mil now
[1:13:28] Jeankof: Dj Khaled must be the head of brand building in the lcs teams, walks in and is asked for a plan and says "all I do Is win win no matter what" LUL
[1:13:32] Padlin: @inero what's the point of the beard if your face is cold?
[1:13:34] メフィスト: honestly it's pretty fun to watch the LCS when the players play well
[1:13:39] inero: @Padlin idk tbh
[1:13:40] SevTST: @urgotabekidding The Flowers stream was scuffed, but it got me to the main FQ stream. Still, it's up to whether or not the Orgs want that traffic on the LCS channel or their own.
[1:13:40] Tameablebread93: I mean why not require more content spots from teams via contract
[1:13:52] メフィスト: so if prioritizing winning makes them play good then that's a pretty big W even if they don't win
[1:13:56] メフィスト: it's hard to like a team that just sucks
[1:14:10] linuscalling: Partner with caster's Couch!
[1:14:13] vilhelmq: Somewhat stupid question maybe, but is there any certain reason we don't get to see allchat on broadcast? I doubt they say anything *that* bad, and it helps show of the players' personalities a lot.
[1:14:15] SevTST: @urgotabekidding I'm not disagreeing with you just so we're clear. I think they should, but I can think of reasons why they wouldn't.
[1:14:35] karlheinzstockfootage: @メフィスト i saw c9 v/ tl that is not playing well . fredit brion could beat both of them
[1:14:36] Fingerszs: 1v1 tourney would be way mroe watched than even a normal weekend of the lcs
[1:14:44] Tokkinlots: Tokkinlots subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:14:49] ProteusWest: people who watch the LCS or any professional League can't really tell if someone is playing well or not unless it's super obvious, or unless a caster or co-streamer points it out
[1:14:50] Ikancast: LoL survivor where they go through obstacle courses
[1:14:50] karonmoser: You can defeinitely enjoy and consume content from a team that sucks.The highest engagement piece of LCS content from a team last year was a DIG content piece when they were completely failing.
[1:14:54] VeteranEU: I would simply administer lethal doses of radiation to any player whose SEO is not adequately growing
[1:14:59] WrathOfKon: truly pair with tyler1!!! he loves LCS playerse
[1:15:02] Jeankof: should have setup something like in-house sponsored by anyone, the pagado break showdown, and hire nacl casters to cast the inhouses
[1:15:09] urgotabekidding: @SevTST oh sure, but if LCS channel is just hosting and the org has their brand overlay splattered all over the place I think the brand awareness outweighs whatever the compensation would be for the viewership for that event. I dunno. More eyes the better for LCS (and orgs) right now IMO
[1:15:18] grandadmiralneckbeard: Idea: Toplaner 1v1 tourney, where Sniper plays each toplaner to see which ones he solokills
[1:15:18] Padlin: @VeteranEU speedrun darwinism
[1:15:21] karlheinzstockfootage: mr. beast
[1:15:28] karlheinzstockfootage: lol
[1:15:28] Pangstrom: Pangstrom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:15:32] SevTST: Less... Shoving it to the teams. More, we can't trust the teams outside of FQ to take advantage and promote themselves and their players.
[1:15:36] urgotabekidding: @grandadmiralneckbeard that's just LCS games :D
[1:15:39] VeteranEU: @Padlin This is not Darwinism. You will receive radiation.
[1:15:41] Padlin: KEKW pinned
[1:15:46] Ikancast: flyquestFQcheer
[1:15:48] Jeankof: based comment
[1:15:49] aequorin628: The FLY event was great
[1:15:52] Tameablebread93: it should have been required by Riot as a condition of membership in LCS ideally imo
[1:15:52] Padlin: @VeteranEU but i am too strong to die from it.
[1:15:57] SevTST: @urgotabekidding Right. If the LCS profits they all ought to profit.
[1:16:02] grandadmiralneckbeard: @urgotabekidding So let's just cut out the boring extra parts :D
[1:16:05] Ian7j2: Bwipo was unhinged it was hilarious
[1:16:12] karlheinzstockfootage: kelby should tell a client to prop up lcs *eyeroll*
[1:16:20] urgotabekidding: @Ian7j2 soooo much fun to watch bwipo going full bwipo
[1:16:24] VeteranEU: @Padlin Yeah too late buddy, ask your doctor how true that confidence is
[1:16:30] Tameablebread93: The day in and day out people at these teams have no incentive to actually brand build though
[1:16:31] Ian7j2: SIIIIUUUU
[1:16:35] julianlearning: its just LCS in a nutshell ngl
[1:16:41] the1andonlycorbin: a Dominate vs DL event with a  pro player from each team on their teams
[1:16:45] Padlin: @VeteranEU i can't have more cancer than playing league already gave me
[1:16:59] PogoStomp: @VeteranEU might be fun to see what happens if he actually couldn't die though
[1:17:03] ProteusWest: he might have you on that one @VeteranEU
[1:17:15] travisgafford: @karlheinzstockfootage wat
[1:17:17] Padlin: @PogoStomp rip to your organs but i'm built different
[1:17:36] Tameablebread93: oh my god it was so dumb, promote your own content ffs
[1:17:38] VeteranEU: @Padlin I concede.
[1:17:40] C9Jack: Teams had very limited time to set something up
[1:17:42] MattySocials: rally cry lol
[1:17:47] Tameablebread93: go off king
[1:17:54] nfcpm: because Flyquest did stuff on their own stream iirc
[1:17:59] Padlin: @VeteranEU the tragedy is that i'm literally nobody and i get more interaction than the average lcs player
[1:18:04] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford he represents mr. beast?
[1:18:07] linuscalling: We see you Cubbie
[1:18:08] BigAngryHobo: The thing that makes me the most sad are that these teams talk so much about how invested they are but they never actually invest when they're given the chance.
[1:18:10] VeteranEU: @C9Jack like 0715 to set up a herald sweep from bot?
[1:18:14] Wyrmoslol: jack Pog
[1:18:15] Niles: They asked us to reschedule the day of but we could not on such short notice
[1:18:16] C9Jack: if this happens in the future I’d love to have more heads up
[1:18:18] julianlearning: booooo
[1:18:20] grandezelx: Huh
[1:18:22] Karpeezy: how much time?
[1:18:22] SevTST: I mean... We've known about this break for a long time...
[1:18:24] lolflailure: so this break wasn't planned months ago..?
[1:18:27] slumdo666: Lol
[1:18:28] SirAstien: HaHAHAHA LOL JACK
[1:18:30] BigAngryHobo: The break was announced before the split started.
[1:18:33] urgotabekidding: I mean...isn't the schedule published a while ahead of time? Like a month before the season start?
[1:18:35] grandezelx: Lol funny
[1:18:35] Padlin: @lolflailure lcs wasn't planned
[1:18:36] Tameablebread93: That sounds cope tbh. We knew this happened before the split
[1:18:43] epicalbawler: blud finna be like
[1:18:44] kerokerogrips: is that the same niles t1 was flaming?
[1:18:45] Ikancast: thats my question wouldnt they know when the season started
[1:18:46] ProteusWest: the break was like 5 or 6 weeks ahead, but maybe Riot said that they were going to do something
[1:18:46] c9_bobby: kelsey hit it LMAO
[1:18:47] lazink: That is classic riot, do things at the last second, and don't advertise it
[1:18:53] lolflailure: @Padlin certainly feels like that sometimes
[1:18:54] travisgafford: @karlheinzstockfootage he does not
[1:18:54] ProteusWest: and then Riot didn't really do anything
[1:18:54] nfcpm: 6 weeks is not enough time
[1:19:02] blaener: kelsey ^
[1:19:10] magiceye7278: @BigAngryHobo It's all lip service. What else is new with the LCS?
[1:19:13] Tameablebread93: Kelsey 100% on point
[1:19:15] Padlin: @lolflailure just spend more time online bozos
[1:19:18] SirAstien: xd
[1:19:18] grandadmiralneckbeard: I mean, even if you found out about the break literally the day of, they can't figure any shit out in more than 2 weeks?
[1:19:27] SwedeBeGoode: The expectation to make content should be on Riot, not on the orgs (but both are good ofc)
[1:19:35] kerokerogrips: c9 was getting smoked they used that time for scrims no?
[1:19:37] VeteranEU: @Padlin but roe v wade was repealed so we have to stick with it
[1:19:41] nfcpm: lucky Flyquest had the skills to pull it together with the limited weeks of notice
[1:19:44] i_play_viktor: Tyler1 vs 5 lcs players in sockem boopers match
[1:19:44] Tameablebread93: It should be on both, both have a clear incentive to build the scene for their own profit
[1:19:51] SevTST: At best we can say that everyone underperformed... That's the most generous take.
[1:19:51] financeconsultant: financeconsultant subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:19:56] Padlin: @VeteranEU unless LCS meets with an unfortunate unplanned accident
[1:19:57] AaeryMusic: 6 weeks is not a LONG time on an op level, but its some time
[1:20:02] urgotabekidding: @SwedeBeGoode Why?  Its in the brand's interest to do cool shit so more people are into their brand...
[1:20:05] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford travis can you name kelby's top 3 ppl he reps?
[1:20:14] BigAngryHobo: NICE
[1:20:17] SirAstien: C9 doesnt have a challengers team they wouldnt have done anything anyways
[1:20:19] PapaSmithy: shoutout joefisx20 and missharvey for carrying the stream stuff both are kings
[1:20:19] SevTST: Still, it feels like the LCS catching a stray for the fact that their partners weren't as on the ball as everyone may have assumed.
[1:20:19] LCSEevee: Twitch prime to travis gafford.
[1:20:19] linuscalling: Nice!
[1:20:20] karonmoser: Thanks!
[1:20:23] aerosbroadbunny: Team McDonald's to go through teams in a gauntlet
[1:20:24] ProteusWest: I am not sure that the teams knew that Riot were going to expect them to carry the content during the break
[1:20:25] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[1:20:31] VeteranEU: @Padlin with their intentions to get in to american high schools, it's merely a matter of time
[1:20:36] ProteusWest: at the beginning of the split
[1:20:38] karonmoser: I lost my massive badge, times are hard mange
[1:20:40] urgotabekidding: @PapaSmithy The overlay was super good for the FQ event.
[1:20:51] vilhelmq: No he has not LUL
[1:20:52] urgotabekidding: Cold take. I 100% agree
[1:20:52] Padlin: @VeteranEU the average league player is already too interested in getting into high schools.
[1:20:55] Tameablebread93: @ProteusWest that's totally a fair comment but that's not quite what was said
[1:20:58] ThexCatmanx: The best you say?
[1:21:04] PapaSmithy: bvoy has played very well
[1:21:05] Tunatoogood: Adc doesn't matter useless role
[1:21:09] slumdo666: Bvoy and Insanity are being GRIEFED by top and jg
[1:21:12] karlheinzstockfootage: plz elaborate in a world with berserker
[1:21:16] SwedeBeGoode: ice cold take but true
[1:21:18] urgotabekidding: if bvoy wasn't on SR there'd be no argument about it...but he's on SR
[1:21:23] slumdo666: If only Licorace and Spica were free agents
[1:21:26] メフィスト: idk if there's anything that can even be done about this, but a problem i noticed with talking to younger people about the LCS, is that there's a really negative perception around "league of legends" in general, where it's viewed as "toxic". hard to get some 18 year olds / young 20s to even entertain the idea (although valorant is more okay for some reason)
[1:21:30] razlol: razlol gifted a Tier 1 sub to baldguyfrombrazzers_! They have given 61 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:21:32] julianlearning: he's looked very good
[1:21:36] epicalbawler: why is brand building always the center of discussion
[1:21:37] vilhelmq: @karlheinzstockfootage eh, serker hasn't been on top of his game this split
[1:21:45] urgotabekidding: @karlheinzstockfootage berserker has been downright mediocre this year. I don't even put berserker in all pro this year
[1:21:46] Lyghtsaber: zeyzal is the one playing starcraft though.
[1:21:47] LCSEevee: @razlol nice.
[1:21:53] Padlin: man, i remember bvoy being mid in europe in 2019 or something
[1:21:54] SirAstien: @slumdo666 agreed Bugi > Sheidan
[1:21:55] the1andonlycorbin: Haha Raz
[1:21:58] VerbalHorse: Yeah Tomo is very solid for sure
[1:21:58] Padlin: why is he being celebrated in NA
[1:21:59] SwedeBeGoode: @razlol gifting a sub to his best friend nice
[1:22:06] ProteusWest: the Pros episode that came out today was interesting, all the players on it, none of which were ADC's, all thought that ADC was super weak
[1:22:06] Tameablebread93: @epicalbawler because in an environment where VC money has dried up you profit streams are important
[1:22:09] ThexCatmanx: Meech has looked good when he hits the flash button

[1:22:14] melond0g: Numbers domt matter if your teamfighting is bad, his teamfighting has not been clean consistently, Bvoy is middle of the pack
[1:22:15] karlheinzstockfootage: he beat tl yesterday for no good reason yesterday
[1:22:17] shewasabulldozer: he’s watching NBA
[1:22:18] SirAstien: Srty > Mask
[1:22:18] Caffeinemia: True
[1:22:19] Tunatoogood: Woooooow
[1:22:19] grandadmiralneckbeard: betrayal D:
[1:22:20] SevTST: *sigh*
[1:22:21] starlitspirit: bvoy is carrying my fantasy LCS team that's my giat
[1:22:21] kerokerogrips: BASED
[1:22:22] Sifuginsaing: Who is Bvoy?
[1:22:24] Drazian: damn if only there were a really good top and jungle available to play for teams
[1:22:26] Caffeinemia: Somebody had to say it
[1:22:29] milk_tea_way: .....I agree.
[1:22:30] grandadmiralneckbeard: Inero is part of the problem
[1:22:34] Wyrmoslol: based
[1:22:34] 1DeepBlue: lmao
[1:22:34] Tunatoogood: It's fun
[1:22:35] Exaltedtales: xdd
[1:22:39] grandezelx: Based
[1:22:42] kerokerogrips: its better gameplay
[1:22:43] RViegs: holy based
[1:22:43] VeteranEU: Actually fucking cooked
[1:22:46] VerbalHorse: Damn bro Inero just spitting facts
[1:22:49] karlheinzstockfootage: tsm bvoy
[1:22:49] ThexCatmanx: Based Inero
[1:22:50] epicalbawler: @Tameablebread93 has any brand content increased revenue to a remotely sustainable amount?
[1:22:52] Padlin: actually tragic that mid-tier korean import in europe in 2019 is good in NA
[1:22:53] WrathOfKon: This is kind of a based topic to talk out with inero
[1:22:55] imhei: this convo feels like deja vu
[1:22:59] thee_mastergen: that's what I'm saying bro i said it last time, its not interesting to watch NA
[1:23:01] Karpeezy: the realest inero
[1:23:06] SevTST: I'm not sure why I tune into this show sometimes. Lol
[1:23:11] VeteranEU: let's be real if you want to be an NA GM you need to know whop's doing well in LPL LCK lmao
[1:23:14] Crawlsballs31: he’s bitter
[1:23:14] timd6210: new  patch
[1:23:17] nfcpm: LCS is on the same patch as DSG
[1:23:22] magillagorilla4sale: Smodge
[1:23:22] VeteranEU: LPL was first no?
[1:23:29] Tameablebread93: @epicalbawler I bet for 100T it has
[1:23:33] Padlin: @VeteranEU no you need to know who's doing well in LDL and lck challenger
[1:23:35] ThexCatmanx: God I love Inero LUL
[1:23:35] Ikancast: best thing about live patch is we get this senna nerf sooner
[1:23:38] milk_tea_way: To Mark's credit, the live patch has made me tune back into LCS after dropping it completely last year.
[1:23:42] Caffeinemia: Haha
[1:23:43] ixbx: yup LPL was fire as first on this patch
[1:23:44] evies_: this poor viewer trying to bring in a positive take about a player and some gameplay only to get shot back into negativity depression
[1:23:51] Tameablebread93: but regardless, it shouldn't be a wild argument that building a brand leads to increased profits
[1:23:57] Jeankof: wait is Inero a MILKMAN enjoyer though,
[1:23:58] inero: NOT MEANING TO BE NEGATIVE I JUST DONT KNOW!
[1:23:58] stephcurrysim: what's the point of having a guest invited to a show primarily tailored around the LCS when said guest isn't watching LCS? what completely dead content but yall have to sit here and pretend it's all a laugh
[1:24:02] ThexCatmanx: If it was easier for me to watch LPL/LCK, I would
[1:24:02] linuscalling: I was here for this
[1:24:04] WrathOfKon: this is a very relevant point that needs to be talked out
[1:24:09] Padlin: @inero too late, you're getting cancelled
[1:24:10] karlheinzstockfootage: shopify that rebellion
[1:24:13] Drazian: hes got a very valid point though
[1:24:19] grandadmiralneckbeard: @Padlin or alternatively, you need to know.. who's in 6-8th place in LCK/LPL I guess?
[1:24:20] Drazian: why bother watching LCS anymore?
[1:24:30] karlheinzstockfootage: i watch lpl, lck
[1:24:30] SunnyDavidRS: IS MARKZ COOKED
[1:24:32] SwedeBeGoode: fun fact, the -ne- in @inero stands for "negative"
[1:24:32] Padlin: @grandadmiralneckbeard the real prospects for future talent
[1:24:40] dropsofliquid: Both of my brothers just watch LCK now. It's kinda sad I miss talking about LCS with them
[1:24:41] SevTST: That one time last year where they completely fucked the schedule yes.
[1:24:44] SevTST: We all remember.
[1:24:48] urgotabekidding: I dunno if that's the case.  I think the "hardcore" league viewer in NA is a small number and probably a minority of those are watching Asian leagues and not watching LCS
[1:24:52] Tunatoogood: I mean at the same point why bother watching EU? They haven't had international results
[1:24:53] SunnyDavidRS: lpl is a bad viewing experience because of the emote-only stream experience
[1:24:54] BigAngryHobo: When I tell people I only watch NA and I only keep up with other leagues to prepare for worlds I get weird comments every time. I'm a rare Team Liquid super fan and I don't follow a person.
[1:24:57] メフィスト: i do know a lot of people in NA who still watch lck (mostly T1) but not lcs
[1:25:04] Sifuginsaing: I only watch LCS because im xenophobic
[1:25:18] grandezelx: T1 leggit destroys all viwership
[1:25:21] ProteusWest: I only follow LCS, I used to see more LEC back when the broadcasts were more connected
[1:25:22] Padlin: @BigAngryHobo does anyone actually hate this though? watching a league as a fan is the most normal experience
[1:25:28] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:25:30] Tameablebread93: I don't watch LEC because who wants to watch bad league
[1:25:30] epicalbawler: i mean obviously the league needs to pivot to a western interregional competitive scene including na eu and brazil. it doesn't have to be one league but why are there ZERO competitions between any of these regions?
[1:25:32] karlheinzstockfootage: i like lcs , i used to watch lec but g2 or rogue always win and fail
[1:25:35] WrathOfKon: I mean saying you are apart of something and you don't care to follow it highlights a HUGE HUGE issue product disconnecting to fans
[1:25:37] Padlin: the people who think that's weird are the people who watch everhting
[1:25:38] Seanatonin_: It's not negative.. it's matter of fact
[1:25:40] Paulo_Ai: the cycle is complete LCS is a 4Fun region again
[1:25:41] Crawlsballs31: XD he cooked the lcs
[1:25:41] nfcpm: so Inero doesn't enjoy LOL. He watched because he is paid to.
[1:25:43] Jeankof: i feel obligated to watch lcs, but  lpl/lck fan culture is so much more fun and engaging
[1:25:44] grandadmiralneckbeard: I just watch every league because I'm addicted to watching LoL
[1:25:50] grandezelx: Lcs needa to get faker and t1 in lcs
[1:25:53] aequorin628: LCS is the only league I watch live, others I'll watch caedrel or iwd vids of
[1:25:55] inero: @nfcpm NO I PLAY TO LEARN AND WATCH ASIA!
[1:25:58] C9Jack: whew guys
[1:26:03] razlol: @nfcpm he just wants to watch the best league of legends
[1:26:04] urgotabekidding: @nfcpm he doesn't enjoy LCS. He's watching lol, just superior LOL
[1:26:07] Tameablebread93: I gave up entirely on results and now it's a blast every week
[1:26:08] linuscalling: Negative with context could be seen as realistic.
[1:26:08] evies_: i wonder what the guests think about bvoy
[1:26:10] Seanatonin_: LPL and VCS right @inero
[1:26:14] epicalbawler: i don't know why fans and riot want to see the west blasted by the east 13 years in a row instead of fostering na/eu/br competition
[1:26:15] lolflailure: are esports not supposed to be fun watching experiences?
[1:26:17] SevTST: I definitely don't watch things that I think are 'for fun'?
[1:26:18] ark91000: DK vs KT was basically a NA series.
[1:26:19] karlheinzstockfootage: lec iwinter champion is crazy stupid
[1:26:20] SkyeTheX: When we don't even talk about the take
[1:26:26] Padlin: @nfcpm bait used to be believable
[1:26:27] Larewt: Meanwhile no one is talking about the callers point lol
[1:26:28] Crawlsballs31: so were the laughing stock
[1:26:29] knocknockout: this is why players and teams need the narrative to drive the viewership
[1:26:32] eavlol: inero is bald
[1:26:36] thee_mastergen: LMFAO
[1:26:37] starlitspirit: genuinely part of why I love LCS so much is that the games are so often really chaotic and weird drafts and that makes for a decent amount of bangers
[1:26:38] thee_mastergen: yes
[1:26:38] Padlin: @eavlol TRUE
[1:26:38] razlol: @eavlol yes
[1:26:39] slumdo666: Top 8 at worlds from a 4fun region?
[1:26:40] RViegs: LMAO
[1:26:40] eavlol: kelsey is based
[1:26:43] BigAngryHobo: @Padlin idk if people hate it but they tell me it's a waste and for me it's like...I watch csgo and other esports to root for TL as well.
[1:26:45] PapaSmithy: is she talking about lpl
[1:26:45] SwedeBeGoode: @Larewt Because it was ice cold
[1:26:46] Seanatonin_: MLS
[1:26:48] grandadmiralneckbeard: @eavlol bold take!
[1:26:48] ThexCatmanx: It is the WWE of LOL
[1:26:53] urgotabekidding: Usually.
[1:26:55] Sifuginsaing: No cap, I actually make an effort to watch NRG games, not because they are good, but because their games are actually the most entertaining since they always give you a heart attack
[1:26:57] milk_tea_way: I think leaning into the For Fun identity has been a positive move, and the live patch might HOPEFULLY give some competitive advantage by forcing the league to innovate.
[1:26:59] kerokerogrips: didnt yall see the esports charts, most LCS viewers are Portuguese viewers from co streams and Europeans watching caedrel
[1:27:07] ProteusWest: Inero is saying what everyone said in 2013 and has said since, just watch LCK and copy it for best success
[1:27:08] The_Blaze83: They and We need BO2'S at Minimum
[1:27:08] Seanatonin_: @VeteranEU  Loves Bovy :)
[1:27:11] Padlin: @BigAngryHobo that's weird tbh, i'm not an NA watcher but i think it's normal to enjoy your own region/team....
[1:27:12] linuscalling: Travis getting the stream back on track.
[1:27:13] SHawkeye77: if ppl don’t care about bad regions why would people watch lec? like not flame but it’s annoying that the same people would support lec viewership
[1:27:15] Crawlsballs31: I’m not sure I understand watching for fun? I like competition and rooting for the Org I like
[1:27:18] SallieMae: spotify?
[1:27:18] Drazian: honestly i was an avid viewr of LCS because i was a Golden Guardians fan but now that they're gone and my next person i wouldve watched for (licorice) isnt on a team
[1:27:21] Seanatonin_: SPOTIFY?! HAHAHA
[1:27:25] ProteusWest: so he's no different from any other coach for the last 11 years
[1:27:25] inero: @ProteusWest NO! ITS JUST MORE FUN!
[1:27:27] VeteranEU: @Seanatonin_ WHEN HE'S ON THE ENEMY TEAM HE'S MY FAVOURITE PLAYER LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:27:31] Lyghtsaber: zeyzal plays bvoy like zven played berserker
[1:27:32] Seanatonin_: xD
[1:27:33] WrathOfKon: @SHawkeye77 Based
[1:27:35] urgotabekidding: Its eye test tho. bvoy mechanically looks better than the other adcs
[1:27:36] imhei: too many years of worlds or bust has made the community jaded and after 10 years of mediocrity its just played out at this point and its too late to go back to just caring about LCS
[1:27:37] Drazian: i genuinely dont see a reason to watch the league anymore
[1:27:40] ProteusWest: you think watching LCK is more fun? LOL
[1:27:41] Seanatonin_: @VeteranEU  you're awesome haha
[1:27:42] Ikancast: kohaibiWaw we need more xayah
[1:27:51] inero: @eavlol shutup.
[1:27:54] SevTST: I don't think it's a new or novel take that you don't watch the LCS for it's skill level.
[1:27:57] inero: @ProteusWest ye
[1:27:59] Satvai: I think bvoy builds bad
[1:28:01] twizna: I think that's key in this conversation. It sounds brutal that Inero says "I dont watch it", but the subtext in this context is important. He's essentially saying: "I am never watching professional league of legends for entertainment. I watch to inform my opinion for coaching. So I watch the best region, not LCS". And that's ok! Folks that only watch league to watch THE BEST GAMEPLAY should only watch LCK/LPL like Inero does. Full stop, there's no argument against that outlook
[1:28:05] Tunatoogood: You watch because it's fun to watch and costreams are funny lol no other reason and that's okay
[1:28:06] SevTST: All the same... I'm not sure you watch the LEC for that reason either.
[1:28:07] razlol: When I was talking to Jojo, Impact and Inspired they said Bvoy is one of the best ADs rn without the best surrounding
[1:28:08] eavlol: @inero bald = invalid opinion old man
[1:28:16] Padlin: to the people saying they don't know a reason to watch: have you considered chilling out and having fun?
[1:28:20] urgotabekidding: @Satvai homie rushed stormrazor on lucian then sold it later this weekened
[1:28:23] eavlol: bald man shouts at cloud
[1:28:24] lilmoodi: MAASSU MY GOAT
[1:28:24] inero: @twizna yeah p much
[1:28:25] ixbx: ehhh you got any more of that smolder shyt? I'm needing a 40 min banger
[1:28:28] Tameablebread93: @twizna very true except LCS* has the best gameplay in the world
[1:28:33] eavlol: goodbye chat
[1:28:33] Archique: Wait, we giving props to Tactical and not Bvoy? Did we watch the TF game?
[1:28:34] eavlol: bald
[1:28:41] inero: @eavlol yeah.
[1:28:45] urgotabekidding: SR licorice please
[1:28:48] razlol: @inero you did not read that stop acting like you read
[1:28:50] Lyghtsaber: @eavlol ur bald inside
[1:28:54] C9Jack: I love league and enjoy watching LCS.  I hope to see western region international events.
[1:28:59] Padlin: i mean i can watch the best leagues duking it out with good strategy
[1:29:00] inero: @razlol Hey man.
[1:29:07] Satvai: fakegod is always killed on the side lane for no reason
[1:29:07] Padlin: but i'd also enjoy watching slogfests
[1:29:09] ProteusWest: I can understand people making an argument for watching LPL for fun, but LCK has always felt boring as crap to me
[1:29:12] slumdo666: FBI is not playing better than Bvoy
[1:29:14] SHawkeye77: bro at what point do we as a community collectively agree just saying bald is not clever or funny at all lmfao
[1:29:14] urgotabekidding: @C9Jack 3 split format, EU vs NA between winter and spring.
[1:29:21] epicalbawler: @C9Jack did u just take my idea i posted
[1:29:26] C9Jack: yeah that would be insane
[1:29:29] Padlin: the same way watching chess players is fun, but watching monkeys wretslle is also great.
[1:29:35] vendolis: LCS had lost me over the last years. With a Family I am not able to watch a lot of games, and when the support products are missing its not fun. ESP that they did not have a Dive after the finals to discuss it turned me off. I just was not able to watch a bo5 on the weekend. Cheer100
[1:29:36] inero: @C9Jack when is rift rivals coming back
[1:29:37] razlol: dont be surprised when player votes in all pro move to Bvoy
[1:29:43] ThexCatmanx: @urgotabekidding Licorice spica
[1:29:56] Padlin: @inero when riot holds the players at gunpoint and makes them fly across the atlantic
[1:29:57] the1andonlycorbin: They touched on it a little on Pros yesterday. ADC is weak rn
[1:30:08] urgotabekidding: @ThexCatmanx That'd be nice but I want IMT spica.  would level up both teams a lot
[1:30:16] Archique: @ProteusWest Thats my thing too. Lets not act like half LCK games arnt absolute stomps unless top team trolls G1 or G2
[1:30:17] grandadmiralneckbeard: tbh, I think the main thing that interests me to watch LCS at the moment is the transparency of the "all hands on deck"-ness of it all. It's interesting to see and root for an ailing product trying to turn itself around
[1:30:17] C9Jack: rift rivals is a weird format.. just make a normal western tournament
[1:30:18] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[1:30:35] Padlin: @C9Jack harder in the west because the timezones suck ass
[1:30:42] ThankQu: first rule is to never trust players about their opinions on other players
[1:30:43] twizna: @inero and i am horseshit at league and like watching palafox giggle in post game interviews, so i tune in to LCS. all viewers have different motivations.  @razlol lmfaooo
[1:30:45] メフィスト: as a TL enjoyer, taking for granted that your carries will carry the game just because you put them in that position is a luxury
[1:30:49] Padlin: rift rivals would better as EUM or americas tournaments
[1:30:54] inero: @C9Jack we change formats every year for everything. It'll just be different anyway
[1:30:57] karonmoser: @メフィスト LOL
[1:30:57] urgotabekidding: 3 splits, NA vs EU, hosted in iceland :D
[1:31:01] SevTST: I went from watching NFL on Sunday's with my daughter to now watching LCS on Sunday's with my daughter. She obviously doesn't watch, but she runs around while I sit and play with her. It's honestly been a good time for us and it gives her mama a break.
[1:31:17] Emcee_Mikey: inero can I dm you damonte discord
[1:31:22] inero: ye
[1:31:23] C9Jack: give me a normal cs style Swiss format with all western teams 4x a year
[1:31:28] Tameablebread93: @SevTST Panthers fan eh?
[1:31:37] Cubbyxx: Majors is the way truly
[1:31:38] urgotabekidding: @C9Jack now that would be awesome
[1:31:40] Padlin: UK let's goooooooooooooo
[1:31:41] LCSEevee: @c9jack that shit would go hard
[1:31:43] app1ethief: holay
[1:31:46] epicalbawler: @C9Jack email riot right now
[1:31:50] SevTST: @Tameablebread93 Oh God no. Vikings fan.
[1:31:53] OG_Plumwick: why?
[1:31:54] VeteranEU: it's 20 past 4, he's a liar
[1:31:54] Tunatoogood: ??????
[1:31:55] OG_Plumwick: what
[1:31:58] Archique: @Tameablebread93 aw damn man. I caught a stray on this one
[1:31:58] OG_Plumwick: ?
[1:31:59] grandezelx: Huh
[1:32:00] Nightbot: @milk_tea_way -> You wanna dance? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[1:32:00] grandadmiralneckbeard: lmao
[1:32:02] Paulo_Ai: weak? oh oh
[1:32:03] Tameablebread93: @SevTST RIP Kirko
[1:32:07] ProteusWest: I appreciate this take the last 5 years I've heard it
[1:32:09] Wyrmoslol: same thing gets said every year
[1:32:09] iamelvis4: LPL looks weak??
[1:32:09] shewasabulldozer: Here’s how the West can still win
[1:32:11] Tunatoogood: Lpl will forever clear EU
[1:32:13] grandezelx: Bro is trolling
[1:32:14] Padlin: @VeteranEU 22 past, lamer
[1:32:18] nfcpm: G2 is the clear best LEC team
[1:32:19] inero: @karlheinzstockfootage wtf LOL
[1:32:22] Drazian: poor inero getting dogged on for a valid take
[1:32:30] SevTST: @Archique Nah, Tepper caught a stray, and no one is sad about that. Lol
[1:32:37] Mounizle: HAHAHA???
[1:32:40] minuilol: @inero what a handsome lad
[1:32:41] Tunatoogood: Lck has always dropped random games
[1:32:42] razlol: I feel threatened
[1:32:43] Jeankof: bro
[1:32:48] Padlin: @minuilol true
[1:32:50] grandadmiralneckbeard: I mean, LCK is almost always super top-heavy, and LPL always looks like shit until they don't
[1:32:54] PapaSmithy: here comes kelsey
[1:32:55] inero: @minuilol hiiii
[1:32:55] ark91000: This is some insane cope
[1:32:58] kerokerogrips: blg, fpx, jdg?
[1:32:58] starlitspirit: nongshim mentioned
[1:32:58] LCSEevee: Idk man milkyway is about to send the west into another galaxy
[1:33:00] ThexCatmanx: All regions shit confirmed?
[1:33:01] Mounizle: bball with inero when @razlol
[1:33:02] julianlearning: let bro cook i need some copium
[1:33:03] SkyeTheX: C9 aint making playoffs... get real
[1:33:03] SHawkeye77: I think this is Brazil’s year
[1:33:04] Tunatoogood: Just how it goes for EU but lck it's them being weak
[1:33:06] Archique: @SevTST lol, im ok with that. tbh I stopped watching when we ran Olson into the ground. do that to all our good players
[1:33:07] Tameablebread93: is this a question
[1:33:13] Jeankof: nah but aint no way we're expecting lpl to look "good" its always like this and then they come to play
[1:33:13] dropsofliquid: Have we fallen so far we're taking LEC calls?
[1:33:14] Mounizle: inero looks like he hasn't seen the sun in 3 months
[1:33:19] Padlin: i will never ever believe in g2 until they show more ADC flexibility.
[1:33:22] SevTST: I'm sorry... Is this a G2 copium take?
[1:33:24] inero: I dont tan sry man @Mounizle
[1:33:26] milk_tea_way: I kinda enjoy this copium.
[1:33:30] PogoStomp: Moral of last call was that LCS is a for fun region and now this man is coming and trying to say we have a chance to win internationally
[1:33:32] Mounizle: dw that's what raz and i are here for
[1:33:33] urgotabekidding: Or 2nd. Top 2 to MSI
[1:33:33] SevTST: G2 of NRG fame?
[1:33:35] VeteranEU: i know literally every streamer this guy subs to lmao
[1:33:36] Tunatoogood: EU FAN
[1:33:41] razlol: @ThexCatmanx it wouldnt be a competition, nick could not handle it
[1:33:42] BeepImaJeep2015: LUL
[1:33:50] Wyrmoslol: get a spray tan or no balls
[1:33:50] SHawkeye77: what do you think about Turkmenistan? like general vibes and shit @inero
[1:33:51] shewasabulldozer: C9 Trojan horse
[1:33:54] the1andonlycorbin: I've said this in past years when watching the eastern teams but then sure enough they dominate the west in international play
[1:33:54] aequorin628: EU FAN DETECTED
[1:33:56] Dayspringg: iron sharpens iron, and the LCK and LPL may look bad here and there in their own leagues, but they still will gigastomp other regions either way
[1:33:57] SevTST: @Archique I feel bad for Baby Boy Bryce. He don't deserve that shit. Lol
[1:33:57] ThexCatmanx: G2 couldnt even take down NRG
[1:33:58] Tunatoogood: WHY WOULD G2 WIN VS LPL WHEN NA CLEARS THEM
[1:33:59] linuscalling: Trojan horse from England
[1:34:01] Ikancast: it wouldnt be the first time C9 laundered for G2
[1:34:03] Tameablebread93: Yeah but @travisgafford you launder Magic the Gathering every HLL episode <3
[1:34:04] shewasabulldozer: C9 disguise as Neeko passive
[1:34:08] dropsofliquid: G2 lost to NRG they're about to get their shit rocked at MSI
[1:34:11] boutakirk: lec does not look good this yeaer tbh
[1:34:13] urgotabekidding: LEC looked weak until last week of playoffs IMO

[1:34:16] slumdo666: LEC has been trash
[1:34:18] nfcpm: Karmine Corp is unstoppable
[1:34:19] Padlin: how do we even ask questions, i only ever watched this on youtube
[1:34:24] ThexCatmanx: @razlol Based and true
[1:34:25] HexBlast: Whole world bad lol
[1:34:26] Padlin: BNRO
[1:34:27] Paulo_Ai: I love my G2 boyz but i dont see the gap closing
[1:34:28] Tunatoogood: Doesn't watch lec... Best chance for g2....
[1:34:30] Drazian: hol up
[1:34:32] Padlin: I DIDN'T WATCH BUT IT SUCKS
[1:34:33] dropsofliquid: Wait he doesn't watch LEC but knows G2 is clean & good?!
[1:34:33] Padlin: ??????
[1:34:34] proxhimo: I mean G2, MDK, FNC look good
[1:34:34] SevTST: I can't even.
[1:34:35] SkyeTheX: I think everyone is struggling with the map changes and grubs addition.. people are having trouble trying to find an identity
[1:34:35] j_tripper: it still looks better than lcs
[1:34:36] PhoenixTheFiery: g2 gonna win, dont watch lec btw
[1:34:38] ark91000: LEC is a one team region
[1:34:40] ixbx: can tell you don't watch LEC when you tried to make a point about G2 losing to KC
[1:34:42] ProteusWest: @Padlin you put takes on the Discord to call in
[1:34:46] ProteusWest: !discord
[1:34:46] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[1:34:47] ThankQu: kelsey with the puzzled look
[1:34:48] SevTST: European Union come get your mans!
[1:34:50] dropsofliquid: This guy deserves a medal he's the peak hotline league caller. Someone give him a sub but he probably has one
[1:34:53] Padlin: @ProteusWest ty i want to put takes in
[1:34:58] proxhimo: Literally top 3 EU would beat top 3 NA soo
[1:35:02] Padlin: so i can verbally beat this caller into the mud
[1:35:07] P4llace: LMFAOOO
[1:35:07] Tameablebread93: I'd pay good money for somebody to come on this show with an argument defended with facts or stats
[1:35:08] ProteusWest: it's probably too late for this show
[1:35:09] danada389: BASED
[1:35:10] Jeankof: :) its doomed after that comment
[1:35:12] NormalGuy66: Coppe
[1:35:14] grandadmiralneckbeard: I kind of think the LEC bad narrative has been super overblown. Like, the bottom few teams look really bad, but it's leagues better than people are acting. Even KC seems borderline salvageable
[1:35:18] VeteranEU: nobody watches what they talk about. THIS is League discourse.
[1:35:28] aequorin628: Might be worth talking about why every region feels sloppy this year
[1:35:29] inero: @VeteranEU YEAH!
[1:35:29] SevTST: @VeteranEU XD
[1:35:30] Tameablebread93: how on earth would this be better than the TSM year with DL
[1:35:39] Jeankof: 2022 worlds was also the best chance for lcs according to lcs
[1:35:39] HexBlast: G2 about to win worlds and then NRG come in with a steel chair
[1:35:42] ThexCatmanx: Inero is beyond based. Hopium merchant for sure
[1:35:43] dropsofliquid: @Tameablebread93 Trust you'd regret that. The people who research their takes are so nervous & read from a paper for 10 minutes until Travis interrupts them
[1:35:44] VeteranEU: @grandadmiralneckbeard LEC bad narrative is because needed to explain their absolutely dogshit pre-season analysis, unironically
[1:35:48] SevTST: The best takes have the least amount of information.
[1:35:49] travisgafford: @Tameablebread93 you're welcome to call in
[1:35:51] legendofivan: not sure how you can genuinely watch more than two leagues and not be in the industry
[1:35:56] ProteusWest: we have the exact same conversation every year
[1:36:00] inero: @VeteranEU SHUTUP EUROPEAN !
[1:36:01] Paulo_Ai: G2 i love them and they are the scrims world champions but the LPL and LCK have too many teams and not many look like BDS or MAD.
[1:36:07] Tameablebread93: @travisgafford no I like to sit here and flame while doing nothing :)
[1:36:12] inero: NA > EU ! GG > BDS 3-0
[1:36:13] Tunatoogood: Lpl vs lck is a discussion but west is still cooked
[1:36:17] travisgafford: @Tameablebread93 fair
[1:36:17] nfcpm: the bvoy caller literally quoted stats
[1:36:20] ixbx: @Tameablebread93 classic, never change
[1:36:21] Padlin: @inero you're just using the timezone to bully us
[1:36:40] Jeankof: do people also know Lpl has to travel for games
[1:36:45] inero: LIsten here buddy, I'm the first North American to ever be imported and play in Europe and that was the easiest shit of my life. EU is TRASH!!!
[1:36:56] Zerotu14: this is our year Kappa
[1:37:02] inero: W/L Record in EU as a player - 0/1
[1:37:04] ProteusWest: why are they fighting? to show dominance and tilt the other side
[1:37:05] aerosbroadbunny: Listen to Inspired explain on PROS what makes a team like T1 stand out above other teams.
[1:37:07] VeteranEU: @inero you lost
[1:37:15] Padlin: "the west"
[1:37:17] yanya7701: no
[1:37:25] SevTST: I got so caught up in this chat that I almost got killed in my game on the other screen. Lol
[1:37:26] inero: @VeteranEU he's just standing still putting out damage!! Maximing his damage!
[1:37:43] shewasabulldozer: NRG are going to clap T1 in quarters and BLG in semis to lose to OKBRO in finals
[1:37:47] Tunatoogood: Lec benches players for having a slight argument with managers
[1:37:50] Tunatoogood: The league is cooked
[1:37:54] HexBlast: I like LEC because they actually promote new talent
[1:37:57] nfcpm: non perkz heretics coming on strong
[1:37:57] Fredthefree: Are good things happening in LCS?
[1:38:16] slumdo666: I am impressed by Mad even tho they got swept
[1:38:19] ProteusWest: @Fredthefree it's fun to watch from a broadcast perspective
[1:38:19] ixbx: @nfcpm Perkz benched, region has a chance now
[1:38:22] Archique: @HexBlast much larger pool to take from
[1:38:24] slumdo666: Myrwyn is insane
[1:38:33] Padlin: inero if i look on leaguepedia the picture shows someone with hair. is this an evil twin?
[1:38:37] dropsofliquid: Does having 2 LPL & LCK teams make it way harder for western teams?
[1:38:40] Paulo_Ai: NA gave that MSI to EU thanks NA for being so kind
[1:38:44] inero: @Padlin mandela effect
[1:38:44] ProteusWest: it's hard to say if LCS is all good or they're all bad, but it's competitive, and that's fun
[1:38:53] epicalbawler: perkz benched and dom is wondering why xD
[1:38:54] Padlin: @inero oh no not the berenstein bears
[1:39:03] epicalbawler: next apa will be benched and dom will be dumfounded
[1:39:05] Tameablebread93: It's definitely the most enjoyable watching experience in a while for me at least
[1:39:09] Jeankof: KEKW
[1:39:10] yanya7701: wait nobody thought g2 was winning MSI but a lot of ppl thought they were winning worlds and Travis destroyed their delusions LUL
[1:39:21] Padlin: man if APA gets benched for a mid tier import then LCS is doomed
[1:39:23] imhei: everyono who watches LCS is obligated to at this point
[1:39:32] grandadmiralneckbeard: @ProteusWest I'm gonna go with not good, but probably better than last year?
[1:39:35] MattySocials: apparently it is super embarassing to watch lcs/nacl lol
[1:39:38] nfcpm: Cubby even watches all the games twice
[1:39:43] SevTST: @Padlin Jojo would bench him if he could. So would Inspired. Lol
[1:39:46] LSF_Frog: bench APA for Pobetler
[1:39:51] SevTST: Impact ain't even stick up for him.
[1:39:54] PhoenixTheFiery: not top 10 is crazy imo
[1:39:54] aequorin628: @Padlin TL Perkz 👀👀👀
[1:39:58] ThexCatmanx: @Padlin A mid tier import would be an improvement

[1:40:19] Padlin: @SevTST why would he leave C9??
[1:40:20] ProteusWest: @grandadmiralneckbeard we had an LCS team in groups at Worlds last year, so doing better is nice
[1:40:22] OG_Plumwick: LMAO
[1:40:23] grandadmiralneckbeard: @SevTST *Impact takes uncomfortable sip from mug*
[1:40:24] epicalbawler: i dont think apa should be benched. the comment was just to hate on dom
[1:40:30] LCSEevee: Based
[1:40:31] urgotabekidding: next
[1:40:34] Tameablebread93: caller is badass though for taking heat and going on.  Fun call
[1:40:34] Exaltedtales: no way bruh
[1:40:34] Tunatoogood: Asian teams are not getting worse such copium
[1:40:34] ThexCatmanx: There is no way it is a level playing field lol
[1:40:34] Padlin: @aequorin628 perkz might do fine but it's suicide for his brand
[1:40:36] Jeankof: i can't wait for msi, these takes always age well LUL
[1:40:40] nocturnavi: I wish I had this confidence
[1:40:41] karonmoser: LCS is the Fast and the Furious of LoL, no one admits to wathcing the latest sequel, but it's fun af
[1:40:41] BeepImaJeep2015: Make them play at our level and then beat them with experience
[1:40:44] Padlin: @ThexCatmanx so? who cares man
[1:40:49] SevTST: @Padlin If you watch Pros this week, you'll see what I mean. They were cookin' that poor man.
[1:40:49] Zerotu14: This is our year TwitchConHYPE
[1:40:50] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:41:02] VeteranEU: @karonmoser I watched the latest Fast and Furious sequel
[1:41:04] Padlin: if your only objective is to do well with a mid tier import for 1 year, who cares about results
[1:41:06] Ian7j2: Chat has been lit tbh
[1:41:08] kerokerogrips: bench apa and yeon and maybe core jj
[1:41:09] slumdo666: It yakes
[1:41:11] メフィスト: i want to bench whoever is calling over impact honestly because all they need to do to win games is just listen to impact
[1:41:14] slumdo666: Takes skill
[1:41:14] CoyoteNA: @inero GoatEmotey
[1:41:15] milk_tea_way: As someone who watches for fun and has watched all 4 major regions this year, I think LCK and even scuffed LPL costream are unfortunately more fun than LCS and LEC.
[1:41:16] imhei: serious suggestion - instead of adding new patches can we start going backwards and removing patches?
[1:41:20] dropsofliquid: I watch live for chat tbh. I lose track of the actual takes half the show
[1:41:26] lec_airport_speedrun: @karonmoser is fast and furious even fun these days, but I deffo see the point
[1:41:31] legendofivan: When are we fighting in space
[1:41:34] embw: For fun region
[1:41:37] danada389: I love F&F and LCS. Coincidence?
[1:41:41] Tameablebread93: @imhei you may be TOO much for a genius for that
[1:41:45] aequorin628: We should do LCS in space then
[1:41:48] c9_bobby: so inero is vin diesel?
[1:41:58] karonmoser: @c9_bobby You're so right honestly
[1:42:01] GodzillaGuerilla: they gave out skins and it didnt increase?
[1:42:02] nfcpm: people came back??? wow
[1:42:03] Ian7j2: It was cause of drops
[1:42:04] urgotabekidding: 3 week break not cratering viewership is great
[1:42:04] ThexCatmanx: @Padlin I would love for it to be a young player who takes his spot over a mid tier import, but it would still be a better product
[1:42:04] PapaSmithy: drops + twitch front page
[1:42:04] ThankQu: LCS is the marvel cinematic universe
[1:42:05] HexBlast: Middle of the season is boring anyway
[1:42:06] Jeankof: vinero diesel
[1:42:08] c9_bobby: but more handsome
[1:42:09] inero: @c9_bobby YES ! BALD!
[1:42:09] Bearus_Aurelius: Viewership is down for NA viewers Travis.
[1:42:11] quintincrusher: The closet slapped
[1:42:12] OG_Plumwick: drops
[1:42:12] razlol: razlol gifted a Tier 1 sub to chinahipster! They have given 62 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:42:13] VeteranEU: it did go down though, because it was up in other regions, so you're further down by being static
[1:42:17] urgotabekidding: @GodzillaGuerilla bruh I watched all weakend, I didn't get a fukkin drop
[1:42:20] Tunatoogood: I did get a drop
[1:42:21] C9Jack: yay 😁
[1:42:22] the1andonlycorbin: I got 4 drops
[1:42:23] VeteranEU: it's like celebrating you didnt lose money when inflation hit 7%
[1:42:25] Ikancast: i got an illaoi and nasus skin
[1:42:26] slumdo666: Inero give us your best Vic impression
[1:42:27] Jeankof: KEKW
[1:42:28] carelesssssss: he
[1:42:29] Ian7j2: I just icons smodge
[1:42:29] Bearus_Aurelius: those numbers count the European and Brazilian viewers no?

[1:42:30] aequorin628: KEKW
[1:42:32] grandadmiralneckbeard: lmao
[1:42:34] Pita26: @travisgafford disagree, static viewership in that scenario is a wim
[1:42:34] carelesssssss: he's one of us
[1:42:35] C9Jack: caught
[1:42:38] Zerotu14: Clap
[1:42:38] MattySocials: @inero has all the drops
[1:42:39] kerokerogrips: admitting the lcs was faking views
[1:42:40] Pita26: *win
[1:42:41] Padlin: @ThexCatmanx if they replace him with a complete random from abroad, who cares? like even if they win 2-3 more games, it doesn't make it more compelling
[1:42:43] Jeankof: thats why Lcs viewership was flat LUL
[1:42:45] SevTST: The open page counts!
[1:42:52] Padlin: LCS fans are brainwashed that international results are interesting
[1:42:52] ThankQu: LCS being carried by non-NA viewers
[1:42:52] urgotabekidding: LCS viewbotting
[1:42:54] Bearus_Aurelius: there are LESS NA viewers than last year
[1:42:56] SevTST: I got 2
[1:42:58] Paulo_Ai: a lurker giving his support for the drops NA is alive again
[1:43:00] VeteranEU: @inero tomorrow I costream czechia slovakia tier 1 league of legends, come watch
[1:43:04] Tameablebread93: Tameablebread93 gifted a Tier 1 sub to C9Jack! They have given 11 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:43:06] linuscalling: This is LCS' year...for drops!
[1:43:11] Dayspringg: i just want to watch live pro league at a decent time and watch my team play
[1:43:17] c9_bobby: i had my stream open for the drops while watching from the studio ngl
[1:43:36] C9Jack: dark cloud Travis
[1:43:36] ThexCatmanx: @Padlin Winning is more compelling than anything
[1:43:36] SevTST: That's not a negative.
[1:43:39] メフィスト: the silver lining is that LCS has been pretty fun to watch
[1:43:49] slumdo666: I dont think its negative its good marketing
[1:43:55] milk_tea_way: Yeah, I think leveraging such stuff is good.
[1:43:56] SevTST: That just means they knew to make sure to keep viewership up when there was a clearly weird break.
[1:44:05] Lyghtsaber: @c9_bobby islandEZ
[1:44:12] iamelvis4: who...Riot doesn't have the "budget" for that
[1:44:12] Jeankof: something something opportunity cost i assume
[1:44:14] Padlin: @ThexCatmanx this is the fakest data that ever faked
[1:44:20] Dayspringg: if only the client was half functional
[1:44:22] LordAudie: bring the dota2 twitch overlay to league
[1:44:23] razlol: idk about leveraging the client, this client is killing me slowly
[1:44:23] urgotabekidding: Directly viewing LCS from client when....?
[1:44:23] Satvai: @cubbyxx what happend to proview
[1:44:24] legendofivan: the biggest resource is the resoruces the client requires from my pc
[1:44:25] Tameablebread93: Riot did their usual gameplan of burying a feature in the client, then saying "nobody uses it" and removed it
[1:44:26] slumdo666: Cubby playing 4D chess
[1:44:27] quintincrusher: Travis videos slap
[1:44:30] SevTST: Let's just not tank the league for we can ACTUALLY blame Markz for stuff.
[1:44:35] Cubbyxx: @slumdo666 Always
[1:44:36] Bearus_Aurelius: naw, we should just keep the same format and keep doing the same things that have lost viewers year over year #sarcasm
[1:44:39] ProteusWest: Cubby?
[1:44:40] Jeankof: oh no
[1:44:40] VeteranEU: Support the military industrial complexes' attempts to get South Korea too tied up in a war to beat NA at Worlds
[1:44:44] Paulo_Ai: Where is Mark Z ? We need to improve the drop system so I can comeback to a LCS stream
[1:44:49] lec_airport_speedrun: Fucking doublelift called in?
[1:44:50] nfcpm: random players should be able to play LCS pros during the broadcast. leverage everything
[1:44:50] shewasabulldozer: damn we are out for spring split today
[1:44:56] Ian7j2: NO
[1:44:56] ProteusWest: makes sense, we just all skip MSI
[1:44:57] Jeankof: so valorant
[1:45:01] Ikancast: PogBones copa america for league of legends
[1:45:01] Ian7j2: NONONONONO
[1:45:03] epicalbawler: include eu too
[1:45:07] Ian7j2: sotlHang sotlHang sotlHang sotlHang
[1:45:07] shewasabulldozer: What if they got rid of LCS and just did a big LEFT
[1:45:10] shewasabulldozer: *LEC
[1:45:14] imhei: as long as we move out of LA im all for it
[1:45:17] Padlin: MAKE WORLDS LESS IMPROTANT

[1:45:19] Bobacola: Bobacola subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 78 months! CONCAF LCS Division
[1:45:21] legendofivan: lcs CHAMPIONSHIP MATTERS TO MEE
[1:45:22] Padlin: YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO GETTING IT
[1:45:27] slumdo666: Kinda convoluted
[1:45:41] Padlin: regional tournaments are FUN
[1:45:46] Tunatoogood: I'm cool with merging the America's
[1:45:46] Padlin: and good ways to draw engagemtn
[1:45:47] dropsofliquid: Imagine if Brazil just easily clears us though
[1:45:50] DarkTarconis: DarkTarconis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:45:55] legendofivan: when the US stomps at olympics, wp. when NA loses, make it easier for NA
[1:45:57] quintincrusher: Lots of great memories of watching LCS championships... before they were in studios this year
[1:45:58] Prophet181: maybe swap to LEC format and have one of the 3 splits be between NA and LLA/CBLOL
[1:45:59] Archique: Gotta imagine the shit-talk from CBLOL has to be fire too
[1:46:00] thoughtfulcoconut: thats literally what LCS playing on live patch is doing
[1:46:01] Tameablebread93: It would be cool to get more brazilian fans involved with LCS
[1:46:02] Padlin: wait let me put in a take that gets ignored, this is driving me mental
[1:46:06] danada389: danada389 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! nice
[1:46:06] grandadmiralneckbeard: let's set up an american regional tourney and get our asses handed to us by guatemala or whatever
[1:46:07] SevTST: Anyone who watched USA at the World Cup can understand how easy it is to watch NA at Worlds and not be so tilted.
[1:46:07] thoughtfulcoconut: You're just gonna have worse players doing it
[1:46:09] legendofivan: LO L

[1:46:21] Badvertisement: is Inero kinda quiet for anyone else
[1:46:23] deekomode: Sadge
[1:46:24] iamelvis4: how to make LCS worse...make an Americas League
[1:46:25] ProteusWest: I think what happens is the LCS totally stomps on those regions and warps their metas
[1:46:29] Paulo_Ai: Captain america is cool
[1:46:45] Tunatoogood: Lcs surely stomps Brazil Clueless
[1:46:46] lolflailure: Riot should move worlds
[1:46:51] VeteranEU: Guys franchising is working for sure (anyway guest 1 and 2 are we slightly dead or completely dead)
[1:46:52] lolflailure: and the offseason to be over Summer
[1:46:52] Archique: @Badvertisement The bald head messes up the acoustics
[1:46:54] Jeankof: i can already see the reddit posts if Lcs teams bomb out to cblol
[1:47:01] SevTST: It's not like the US wins in everything we do. You can root for the home team but just enjoy an overall tournament. It's not that hard when it's not like... US Basketball or Womens World Cup where we ought to win.
[1:47:07] Badvertisement: @Archique right, reverb and such
[1:47:11] aequorin628: Honestly I like this idea
[1:47:12] inero: @VeteranEU YES FRANCHISING WON
[1:47:21] Ian7j2: Because it was depressing Travis
[1:47:28] aerosbroadbunny: Instead of MSI, do a western and Eastern championships. Then worlds brings all regions together.
[1:47:30] HexBlast: Merging americas would kill the Brazilian fan base
[1:47:31] iamelvis4: How many people watched the video?
[1:47:31] thoughtfulcoconut: why would you want a tournament of lower quality play. at least the LCS as it is rn is marginally interesting
[1:47:39] VeteranEU: @inero I HOLY HECKING LOVE FRANCHISING
[1:47:42] Drazian: i mean they already did it with PCS, folding LCO and LJL into it
[1:47:50] karonmoser: @VeteranEU I got my TGI sub back, so I am thriving
[1:47:52] ProteusWest: I am not basing my idea that LCS will be better than Brazil on anything like the times they've faced each other
[1:47:56] nfcpm: i dont see value in merged regions.
[1:48:00] Drazian: it wouldn't surprise me if they did it with americas regions
[1:48:12] Tameablebread93: I feel like they could do that in a manner that would be actually pretty neat. I also bet they won't do they
[1:48:16] quintincrusher: Screw Valorant
[1:48:16] Ian7j2: If they go to America's for LCs that'll be the nail in the coffin for me as a fan likely
[1:48:16] Badvertisement: 16 regions is way too many wtf
[1:48:17] Ikancast: although in valorant a C9 player got into some drama last year for him and hif gf ranting on twitter about the south american players taking jobs away from NA players
[1:48:20] Tameablebread93: do that*
[1:48:23] legendofivan: lol
[1:48:24] Jeankof: ljl
[1:48:32] Tunatoogood: Tft just merged regions if you guys care
[1:48:33] Archique: @Ikancast NA Classic
[1:48:39] aequorin628: Americas league is just the correct way to do it. NA and Brazil don't have the playerbase to sustain a major region, but combined they would.
[1:48:43] Tunatoogood: There's no North America in Tft anymore
[1:48:46] nfcpm: Travis so now all games would be via lan? No studio? No fans?
[1:48:50] Seanatonin_: ???
[1:48:57] Hookwinked: !discord
[1:48:57] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[1:49:07] grandadmiralneckbeard: VCT americas makes more sense to me because there's relative parity between the regions being folded in. I mean, a Brazilian team won Champions before an NA team did
[1:49:18] ProteusWest: Brazil has a good fanbase
[1:49:26] Seanatonin_: it would make LCS FANS FEEL GOOD TRAVIS
[1:49:30] kerokerogrips: didnt TL lose to a Vietnamese team?
[1:49:34] Seanatonin_: THINK OF THE ANTICIPATION FACTOR OF FEELING GOOD
[1:49:34] VeteranEU: LCS has lost to LCO when LCO literally didn't exist, what is this cope LMAO
[1:49:39] aerosbroadbunny: Separate Eastern and Western championships
[1:49:51] PapaSmithy: @VeteranEU LCO > LCS > LEC?
[1:49:51] iamelvis4: When IWD watches CBLOL....the gameplay looks rather wanting
[1:49:53] cozycoffin_: LCS is not that strong compares to other regions...
[1:49:56] ProteusWest: @VeteranEU KABOOM
[1:49:58] Badvertisement: @aerosbroadbunny we would finally win OMEGALUL
[1:49:59] SevTST: If LCS can dominate CBLOL, you'll still get a ton of engagement from CBLOL because it's not like they're just gonna be chill about it.
[1:50:08] Seanatonin_: OGN format yesCubby

[1:50:35] dropsofliquid: @SevTST And if they get better they're going to be so hyped about wins
[1:50:39] thoughtfulcoconut: thats just a placebo buff to NA viewership though
[1:50:39] Tunatoogood: CBLOL Def clears all of NA that's not top 2
[1:50:51] thoughtfulcoconut: there's gonna be a lot of LCS fans that wont watch a combined league too
[1:50:53] OG_Plumwick: surely
[1:50:54] ProteusWest: LCS gets good engagement from LEC fans, and I am not really sure that LCS fans enjoy that
[1:50:54] SevTST: @dropsofliquid Exactly. It works on all fronts tbh.
[1:50:54] Seanatonin_: @Tunatoogood KEKW
[1:50:58] quintincrusher: If we just destroy Valorant servers we can take back the arena and all will be great again
[1:51:03] OG_Plumwick: surely imt doesnt shit stop the top cblol team
[1:51:03] lec_airport_speedrun: @tunatoogood IMT clears that region, what are you waffling about
[1:51:07] OG_Plumwick: stomp
[1:51:10] milk_tea_way: Why?
[1:51:16] Dayspringg: but inero still wont watch it
[1:51:17] grandadmiralneckbeard: NA teams are such chronic underachievers that we'd probably just be worse than the CBLOL teams in a couple of years lol
[1:51:18] Badvertisement: ty for turning up inero :D
[1:51:29] Padlin: cblol viewership isn't real
[1:51:31] メフィスト: are any of these changes even necessary? viewership per region seems to be pretty much aligned with playerbase counts per region
[1:51:36] Padlin: baiano viewership is real
[1:51:50] ProteusWest: the question is whether or not you kill both products by combining them
[1:51:54] urgotabekidding: from an advertising perspective an american viewer is more valuable than a brazillian one though you can't just compare absolute counts
[1:51:56] nfcpm: but cblol viewers will drop when their teams keep losing
[1:51:58] Tunatoogood: Move to LA would be so bad lmao
[1:52:08] Seanatonin_: Move LCS to Houston
[1:52:09] Sprintspeed: what if LCS teams just move to brazil LUL
[1:52:12] aerosbroadbunny: Have them be like conferences that traditional sports have
[1:52:15] Ian7j2: Put the league in Mexico City like world's LOL
[1:52:17] Jeankof: lcs players giving up LA LUL
[1:52:19] jacklgrey: mexico city
[1:52:20] razlol: VAMANOOOOOOOS
[1:52:23] MattySocials: just move to cincinnati
[1:52:25] RlDennis: Texas, obviously Kappa
[1:52:28] RViegs: Move LCS to Canada
[1:52:31] Padlin: NO FUN ALLOWED
[1:52:32] aequorin628: Riot is an LA company so there's no way it moves
[1:52:32] razlol: LETS GO TO BRASIIIIIIIL VAMOOOOS
[1:52:36] lolflailure: is Riot Games making the LCS for the fans or are they making the LCS for Riot Games?
[1:52:36] ProteusWest: that doesn't sound expensive at all
[1:52:37] deekomode: KEKW
[1:52:37] thoughtfulcoconut: @ProteusWest diluting the product with more teams and worse players will kill the product
[1:52:38] shewasabulldozer: move to Australia

[1:52:43] evies_: the word you want is nomad
[1:52:45] SevTST: That's why tourney's make more sense. Because you can just travel for the tournament.

[1:52:46] dropsofliquid: You can use my guest room in Austin too nbd

[1:52:57] Nodack: yeah having a venue for important things would be cool
[1:52:59] VeteranEU: get this guy in as commissioner, unironically, this would be cheaper than the current system lmao
[1:53:00] Bearus_Aurelius: things need to change or LCS is going to be gone. can't keep doing the same old shit
[1:53:01] quintincrusher: 20 people in THE CAGE
[1:53:01] Archique: Hot Take: Lets put it in TX. Riot can blame power grid when they take breaks during winter
[1:53:03] kerokerogrips: if you are going remote why not switch to bo3 while at it
[1:53:06] Padlin: doesn't matter if it sells out
[1:53:06] Jeankof: LUL
[1:53:13] Padlin: if it's the same 100 people it's still sad
[1:53:16] timd6210: lol
[1:53:19] nfcpm: How many NA players are willing to for $30K a year in  Brazilian reals
[1:53:21] epicalbawler: does it actually sell out weekly?
[1:53:21] lolflailure: is the LCS selling out to LCS fans, or to Riot Game Devs?

[1:53:25] razlol: @Padlin its literally not the same people

[1:53:37] inero: just
[1:53:39] inero: exaggeration
[1:53:39] Padlin: _if_
[1:53:41] ark91000: It would obviously be based in Brazil
[1:53:41] timd6210: this guy is stoned lol
[1:53:42] Jeankof: housing alone surely blows it out
[1:53:46] aerosbroadbunny: Have LCS, LLA, and CBLOL all be conferences in the America's league and the only time they come together is for playoffs.
[1:53:47] milk_tea_way: As the minor region in terms of viewership, shouldn't LCS move to CBLOL.\
[1:53:49] artvandelay32: just opened the stream..genuine question: is this show/its hosts still pretty negative/focused on costs viewership etc? haven't watched much HLL this year despite watching every LCS game ..
[1:53:49] ProteusWest: so if we have a League that has both Brazil and the US involved, what's the Visa situation there?
[1:53:50] razlol: @Padlin ah
[1:53:50] Seanatonin_: NGL
[1:53:54] Seanatonin_: I'll move to brazil
[1:53:59] shewasabulldozer: move it all to Panama City
[1:54:00] lazink: Move to Vegas
[1:54:01] Seanatonin_: if travis pays me
[1:54:02] shewasabulldozer: the Falkland Islands
[1:54:03] quintincrusher: TEXAS middle ground?
[1:54:05] VeteranEU: if they did The Americas and it wasn't a tour then they're actually just dumb, like actually dumb
[1:54:05] Padlin: @razlol but ty for reply, still good info <3
[1:54:08] shewasabulldozer: Cuba
[1:54:08] LKX_tv: lcs to chicago?
[1:54:10] Paulo_Ai: cblol have football teams fanbase thats the secret Keepo
[1:54:11] shewasabulldozer: Cuba is the compromise
[1:54:15] razlol: take me to brasil so i can get a BBL
[1:54:16] RlDennis: Go in between. Time for Mexico boys
[1:54:16] SkyeTheX: Travis is already dressed for it
[1:54:20] RViegs: someone morde ult travis
[1:54:21] scrapabidoopimpaff: TRAVIS TO BRAZIL LETS GOOO
[1:54:21] Padlin: i've been to brazil a few times
[1:54:22] Sprintspeed: rent in the favelas is pretty cheap
[1:54:22] linuscalling: Neutral ground...Mexico City. Then the C in LCS could stand for Cartel.
[1:54:23] grandadmiralneckbeard: already booked my flight
[1:54:25] Padlin: i play vs morde in toplane
[1:54:26] danada389: Move the LCS to the midwest you cowards
[1:54:28] leagueofemily: i know BR-PT as it relates to LoL
[1:54:31] leagueofemily: and swears
[1:54:33] SwedeBeGoode: @inero you've been part of twitch chat - you know how it works - everything will always be taken at face value
[1:54:35] erwat: magic is popular there iirc
[1:54:36] KiaboBandit: Ah, Raz with a BBL. That's the dream
[1:54:37] PapaSmithy: i like that inero looks like he's calling in stock picks on a flip phone
[1:54:45] Paulo_Ai: Mark Z Please GIVE US more DROPS
[1:54:46] quintincrusher: @danada389 COWARDS.
[1:54:49] Seanatonin_: blackberry
[1:54:55] Padlin: @PapaSmithy and he's getting just as many wins ;)
[1:54:56] SevTST: Riot makes the rules so... It's what Riot wants to do. Not what the LCS wants to do.
[1:54:58] thoughtfulcoconut: 4fun show
[1:55:00] quintincrusher: MIDWEST RIOT is in St. Louis?
[1:55:04] shewasabulldozer: @papasmithy dump LCS stock, buy CBLOL
[1:55:05] dropsofliquid: He did get a drop he's a viewer dw
[1:55:05] ProteusWest: Inero only watches during drops
[1:55:09] grandadmiralneckbeard: @PapaSmithy "Put more shorts on LCS"
[1:55:09] deekomode: based
[1:55:10] numiiigoesrawrz: OMG
[1:55:11] danada389: @quintincrusher these californias could never handle the winters
[1:55:12] theemarkz: i watch this show but tbh kinda regretting it
[1:55:14] Jeankof: dig vs imt vs shopify
[1:55:14] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:55:15] theemarkz: KEKL
[1:55:15] aequorin628: They are 7th
[1:55:16] leagueofemily: LMAO
[1:55:17] Auixerre: wow...imagine not being friends with every pro player
[1:55:17] 1DeepBlue: Are there 7 teams left? I don't even know anymore
[1:55:23] Sprintspeed: @theemarkz Pog
[1:55:25] linuscalling: Skins for the win.
[1:55:25] deekomode: mark KEKW
[1:55:26] P4llace: @theemarkz HAHHAHA
[1:55:27] Tameablebread93: oh no its mark hide
[1:55:28] slumdo666: KEKW
[1:55:32] KiaboBandit: LCS Ohio would be inexpensive and would have sold out shows regularly
[1:55:32] dropsofliquid: He paid someone to use his twitch to say that
[1:55:34] Paulo_Ai: Lets go theemarkz give us our drops
[1:55:38] C9Jack: me too Mark
[1:55:39] SevTST: I also kinda regret it. Lol
[1:55:40] davidr0x: hi Mark
[1:55:42] razlol: @theemarkz for the first time ever Travis is the one thats the least negative
[1:55:42] Paulo_Ai: LUL
[1:55:43] j_tripper: MARK FIX THE PLAYER CAMS
[1:55:43] karonmoser: Toronto is the seat of power
[1:55:43] leagueofemily: Toronto pog
[1:55:45] JinnAxel: @theemarkz BOOOOOO
[1:55:45] RlDennis: Doesn't watch, still knows team placements better than me. peepoSad
[1:55:51] danada389: moving lcs to the midwest means better soloq ping
[1:55:52] rosiestofthorns: Mark I got no drops from watching in client this weekend :'(
[1:55:54] theemarkz: if you didnt get a drop its because I personally said not to give it to you
[1:55:56] j_tripper: HOW ARE THEY STILL OUT OF FOCUS
[1:55:59] dropsofliquid: Noooo the bench APA whiner
[1:56:07] slumdo666: Mark keep up the good work king
[1:56:07] Paulo_Ai: Oh no
[1:56:08] Jeankof: for who though?
[1:56:08] rosiestofthorns: @theemarkz Thank you <3
[1:56:12] timd6210: @theemarkz lmao
[1:56:13] Padlin: @theemarkz can you put in a good word next week then pls
[1:56:13] funnythang: @theemarkz based
[1:56:17] epicalbawler: @j_tripper its pretty unreal isnt it
[1:56:19] numiiigoesrawrz: take: for TL's next split, they should consider replacing mid and ADC if they don't make it through spring playoffs
[1:56:21] SevTST: This is what I want from my commish.
[1:56:22] dropsofliquid: Who are they upgrading with caller?
[1:56:22] kerokerogrips: HELL YEA REPLACE APA AND YEON, and start looking into Corejj replacement
[1:56:25] RlDennis: @theemarkz peepoSad But Maaaaark
[1:56:27] VeteranEU: guys whats cheaper 100 rents in LA santa monica a month or 100 economy flight tickets fkin kentucky or some shit
[1:56:30] Dayspringg: @theemarkz it all makes sense now
[1:56:31] Tbone_1337: @theemarkz only part of the show u have to VOD review is my take, saved you two hours prayge
[1:56:34] shewasabulldozer: bench Impact, UmTi and CoreJJ. import Cabochard, Bo and Targamas.
[1:56:36] linuscalling: !reward
[1:56:37] ark91000: No, TL should keep APA and Yeon for another year.
[1:56:38] cr0ckp0tt: Sven to ADC
[1:56:38] PogoStomp: Zven and an import mid
[1:56:41] KiaboBandit: @theemarkz can you love LCS to Ohio? It could cut a lot of costs and you could build a bigger studio/arena
[1:56:42] karonmoser: POG IMPORT SLOT GET RANDOM KOREAN WHOO
[1:56:46] theemarkz: going back to cooking and not reading chat
[1:56:47] Padlin: @VeteranEU aren't US flights a rip off for 0 reason
[1:56:47] KiaboBandit: Move*
[1:56:49] cozycoffin_: LETS GET RULER AND FAKER ON TL!!
[1:56:50] VeteranEU: AHAHAHAHA
[1:56:53] ProteusWest: this is a true TL fan
[1:56:54] VeteranEU: HANG UP ON HIM PLEASE
[1:56:54] quintincrusher: Doesn't Matter JOJO and the boys will body them
[1:56:54] dropsofliquid: Who are they getting mid year bro
[1:56:57] ThankQu: JUST HIGHER MORE KOREANS KEKW
[1:56:57] deekomode: lmaoo
[1:56:58] lec_airport_speedrun: @karonmoser TL Poby, mmmmm
[1:57:00] dropsofliquid: And how are you a TL fan without liking imports
[1:57:03] LordAudie: DECENT?
[1:57:06] LordAudie: not even good?
[1:57:12] slumdo666: They should import Perkz
[1:57:13] shewasabulldozer: TL can just import Doinb and Uzi, they’re not busy
[1:57:14] Jeankof: true lets import Fate and ship him off after a split wooooo
[1:57:16] LCSEevee: @veteraneu im pretty sure there was some guy who instead of getting a dorm flew like 3 hours daily back and forth to school because it was cheaper
[1:57:17] Tameablebread93: Zven needs to have a team or i lose my mind
[1:57:19] razlol: if we're calling for an import lets be more specific as to who
[1:57:22] cr0ckp0tt: Pobelter + Sven
[1:57:22] slumdo666: TL Perkz POG
[1:57:22] JinnAxel: Really drinking the Steve koolaid
[1:57:23] shewasabulldozer: @slumdo666 hahaha banger
[1:57:23] twizna: This guy cant be real
[1:57:25] danada389: ERL BETTER THAN NACL
[1:57:25] OG_Plumwick: thats a support no?
[1:57:27] epicalbawler: @razlol faker
[1:57:28] vilhelmq: Yeon is good enough, you don't need to import for the sake of importing lmao
[1:57:30] P4llace: @razlol this
[1:57:35] LordAudie: he would rather have a decent import than a NA player
[1:57:36] urgotabekidding: I'd love zven to take yeon's job
[1:57:36] CouchyHOTS: TL showmaker 🙏
[1:57:38] RlDennis: Time to re-import Nisqy and get Zven back
[1:57:39] lolflailure: who is this guy
[1:57:40] MattySocials: LMAO
[1:57:43] メフィスト: i'm as disappointed in APA as anyone but it feels a bit early to replace him, there are upsides to his play still, he just has a lot of rookie stuff to work through
[1:57:43] grandadmiralneckbeard: I'll have.. literally any korean import, please
[1:57:44] VeteranEU: nice this guy's brain is literally molded by propoganda interviews and algorithms lmfao
[1:57:45] cozycoffin_: TL Faker TL Ruler Steve hands both a blank check
[1:57:47] shewasabulldozer: @razlol we don’t do that here
[1:57:50] Sprintspeed: just import Ruler dignitas can outbid JDG right
[1:57:53] imhei: like this podcast?
[1:57:54] leagueofemily: "mid stuff"
[1:57:55] imhei: boom roasted
[1:58:00] SevTST: @danada389 Do you mean for this to be a take? There's like 8098038 ERL teams. Lol
[1:58:07] jacklgrey: I hate this take and takes like it because there's never a player that they would have instead
[1:58:09] ark91000: NA jungle, Chovy and Ruler
[1:58:10] ixbx: FQ mid?
[1:58:10] quintincrusher: doesn't matter.  JoJo is inevitable
[1:58:11] Jeankof: LUL
[1:58:12] Ikancast: pobelter was on broadcast this week
[1:58:16] razlol: I can accept it if people say Quad
[1:58:16] cr0ckp0tt: POBELTER
[1:58:17] CouchyHOTS: bring back toucouille
[1:58:18] KiaboBandit: If you guys think that Steve hasn't offered both Ruler or Faker a blank check already, you're nutz
[1:58:19] LCSEevee: Just get faker easy
[1:58:20] Nightbot: If you have an active Amazon Prime Account you can link it to Twitch Prime & you'll be able to Subscribe to Travis for "Free" every month! These do not automatically re-sub, so remember to check if its available! More details here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[1:58:22] slumdo666: Cubby knows
[1:58:22] legendofivan: mE
[1:58:27] shewasabulldozer: APA has legit played for like one split, one playoffs and four worlds games, you cannot fairly evaluate a guy who has barely more experience than Quid
[1:58:29] Padlin: it's spelled poBELTer
[1:58:31] dropsofliquid: He's probably going to say Faker or something braindead
[1:58:31] Tameablebread93: Quad is actually insane
[1:58:32] cozycoffin_: just buy faker ez
[1:58:34] epicalbawler: quad quid qued quod quud
[1:58:34] danada389: @SevTST I was shitposting the caller. Though it was ambiguous.
[1:58:35] nfcpm: flyquest challengers has an awesome mid
[1:58:37] s1ege3: lol cubby always asking if people are watching challengers league, Travis doesnt even watch it but complains about import boomerangs
[1:58:39] ProteusWest: wait, so we would have Quad and Quid?
[1:58:42] Padlin: is quad related to quid
[1:58:42] Archique: Quad actually would be it lol
[1:58:45] Jeankof: I'd be so tilted as Roamer if Quad got called up for TL
[1:58:46] vilhelmq: @LCSEevee varför är du vaken fortfarande lol
[1:58:48] grandadmiralneckbeard: why hasn't TL recreated 2013 T1 roster yet, are they stupid?
[1:58:50] shewasabulldozer: just swap APA and Yeon. Ziggs bot Lucian mid. sorted
[1:58:51] SevTST: @danada389 Got ya. Lol
[1:58:53] LordAudie: LMAO
[1:58:54] artvandelay32: apa is worse than dove and mask surely finding an upgrade import isn't hard ?
[1:58:54] slumdo666: Lmao
[1:58:56] Sprintspeed: we need to see the Quad vs Quid rivalry
[1:59:00] twizna: Bet some quid on the quad vs quid match, innit
[1:59:02] slumdo666: This guys must be IMTs GM
[1:59:03] SkyeTheX: The Quid Quad? The Squid Squad.
[1:59:04] LCSEevee: @vilhelmq im in korea bro
[1:59:06] kerokerogrips: Isn't Abbedagge a free agent rn?
[1:59:08] jacklgrey: 100%
[1:59:09] leagueofemily: what is scouting really
[1:59:12] shewasabulldozer: @grandadmiralneckbeard why does TL, the richest of the teams, not simply snap up the other teams? are they stupid?
[1:59:12] LCSEevee: Its 1 pm here
[1:59:17] Padlin: @LCSEevee doing what
[1:59:19] SevTST: Bring Vicla back. That worked so well.
[1:59:20] Dayspringg: go get perkz
[1:59:22] imhei: was this player born in the continental US or not?
[1:59:22] Archique: @kerokerogrips Yeah, but I dont think he wants to leave EU
[1:59:23] Seanatonin_: @leagueofemily i think that's the act of being scout
[1:59:24] KiaboBandit: I just wish APA just stopped playing azir. Our drafts in TL have been awful
[1:59:26] LCSEevee: Living with LS
[1:59:26] quintincrusher: I only watch the game for 1 split imports. Always excited to meet new friends that don't know who I am!
[1:59:27] Tameablebread93: I think it's easy to rag on Apa because he had a bad week and people are reactionary
[1:59:28] epicalbawler: bring back emenes
[1:59:34] SevTST: Yo~
[1:59:35] slumdo666: Strawman
[1:59:36] RlDennis: Time to bring Froggen back. Anivia = Blue. TL = Blue. perfect match. Kappa
[1:59:37] Jeankof: the skype take is valid though
[1:59:38] razlol: VENTRILO
[1:59:42] razlol: TEAM SPEAK
[1:59:43] epicalbawler: emenes manifesto was king
[1:59:43] vilhelmq: @LCSEevee oh shit, guess i'm the one with the degenerate sleep schedule
[1:59:43] P4llace: LOL
[1:59:44] VeteranEU: probably the difference is we're talking about human beings
[1:59:55] LCSEevee: @vilhelmq LOL
[1:59:56] slumdo666: Based Inero
[1:59:56] Sprintspeed: does skype even exist i thought it was turned into microsoft teams
[2:00:00] Padlin: @VeteranEU "human beings"
[2:00:01] ProteusWest: Ventrilo and Team Speak did replace Skype for us back in the day
[2:00:03] shewasabulldozer: @leagueofemily scouting is for cowards. real GMs sign 10th place LCK challengers players and pray
[2:00:06] SevTST: @VeteranEU Oh, so they're people now?
[2:00:09] Drazian: wait why use skype and not discord?
[2:00:13] Tunatoogood: I mean core sucks now too
[2:00:18] travisgafford: !skype
[2:00:19] Nightbot: Travis uses Skype because it has a technology called NDI that allows him to import the video feeds directly into the broadcast software. Other communication applications do not have this functionality. You can read more here: https://www.skype.com/en/content-creators/
[2:00:23] slumdo666: Yeon is fine but APA is statistically the worst mjdmm
[2:00:27] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[2:00:27] Jeankof: TL built like a your budget fifa ultimate team when you cant buy fifa points
[2:00:27] Padlin: @LCSEevee legit? neat
[2:00:31] slumdo666: *mid
[2:00:41] Drazian: I want lico mode back on a team so I can watch LCS again
[2:00:45] jacklgrey: 10000000%
[2:00:45] aerosbroadbunny: Watch PROS from this week. Inspired breaks down why TL seems mid right now.
[2:00:48] kerokerogrips: yeon and apa cant carry sorry they need lane carries to get this team the wins umti and impact fight so hard for
[2:00:49] nfcpm: TP is not APAs friend
[2:00:49] shewasabulldozer: drop APA for Perkz, Yeon for Zven and CoreJJ for Rekkles xd
[2:00:50] legendofivan: RJS NO NAME PLATES
[2:00:52] Tameablebread93: Put APA on a team where he has more support and I bet he looks a lot better
[2:00:54] twizna: @Tunatoogood doesn't win for several years = sucks, truuueeeee man big brain
[2:01:09] artvandelay32: feels like deflection to dismiss the notion that apa isn't good enough for a title challenging team just because a specific replacement wasn't named
[2:01:12] ProteusWest: @shewasabulldozer that is the most TL roster ever
[2:01:14] dropsofliquid: @Tameablebread93 Or just even give him some more time & a supportive fanbase :(
[2:01:15] slumdo666: Copy
[2:01:15] Tunatoogood: Core has made so many mistakes in and out of lane don't be delusional
[2:01:16] Drazian: @Nightbot ah ok that makes sense
[2:01:20] LordAudie: Copy RIP
[2:01:22] cozycoffin_: the reason why Yeon is still on TL is because Esports winter. Once the market is better Steve will buy another HOT ADC similar to Hans Sama 100%
[2:01:24] ark91000: Zven is actually a good option
[2:01:27] ixbx: o7 5Fire
[2:01:28] P4llace: man copy
[2:01:30] P4llace: :(
[2:01:33] KiaboBandit: APA shines best on niche picks, stop having him play air and other control mages
[2:01:34] Deathlance: I think nobody talks about a carry top because impact has very clearly been the shining light of the team all split
[2:01:38] nfcpm: have fudge play TL mid. he is washed as C9 top right.
[2:01:41] shewasabulldozer: @proteuswest we’re reaching deeper levels of importing than ever before
[2:01:46] Jeankof: Abbe is the only name that comes to mind if you're trying to bring in someone to emergency qualify for worlds, otherwise why replace Apa if its not for an auto win
[2:01:49] ThankQu: @cozycoffin_ didn’t TL hire Hans Sama before?
[2:01:52] s1ege3: watch challengers and fiind out?
[2:01:54] Archique: @dropsofliquid tbh, i'm losing support for him. Kind of toxic and prob needs to stop all-chatting
[2:01:57] dropsofliquid: @KiaboBandit He's learning those champions though. He has to play them to improve
[2:02:00] cozycoffin_: @ThankQu they did
[2:02:08] dropsofliquid: @Archique eh he's just trying to be entertaining
[2:02:09] shewasabulldozer: TL drops rookie to bring in rookie —> fans criticise rookie for not being good yet —> TL drops rookie to bring in rookie —> fans
[2:02:10] Hookwinked: Svenskeren was streaming mid lane all day, autofilled to support, playing senna. he could play mid support or ad easy
[2:02:12] LCSEevee: I think TL should get warrior.
[2:02:20] ThankQu: @cozycoffin_ what happened to that team?
[2:02:22] cozycoffin_: @ThankQu im saying TL will find another GOOD ADC when market is better
[2:02:22] GodzillaGuerilla: could you elaborate on the TL issue building their roster Kelsey?
[2:02:23] メフィスト: APA was pretty good on taliyah outside of his brain fart moments
[2:02:23] onetrueshawn: that's not a valid argument either. what if all koreans below top pro level are better ? the argument should be framed around what they do wrong and well. just providing a "name" doesn't fix the argument
[2:02:27] Gryffinn: @LCSEevee warrior/.
[2:02:28] KiaboBandit: Thats all well and good but he can learn them while also smashing with more diverse picks
[2:02:31] Solomonike: I think the issue is that APA was considered a rookie too so they just want to mix it up
[2:02:32] cozycoffin_: @ThankQu they last in finals
[2:02:34] quintincrusher: Froggen
[2:02:39] quintincrusher: ALL DAY
[2:02:48] メフィスト: @Solomonike APA is a rookie
[2:02:53] linuscalling: What is Haeri up to?
[2:02:59] LCSEevee: @gryffinn Looking to roleswap to mid to play for TL?
[2:03:05] shewasabulldozer: all these peasants thinking there isn’t a better replacement for APA. as if the notorious P.O.B isn’t sitting on the sidelines waiting to smoke these fools. lmao
[2:03:08] twizna: @Tunatoogood sure, but power rank the supports in lcs, weight your ranks against relative cost, brand value, etc. all im saying is he doesn't SUCK in the context of being a resident in LCS lmfaao, but nah, lets just reduce to "nah bro he makes mistakes, he sucks, ur delusional".
[2:03:10] grandadmiralneckbeard: @Archique I disagree. The all-chatting is really the one thing I like about him
[2:03:20] cozycoffin_: would of liked to see Yeon and Elya bot lane tbh
[2:03:21] Sprintspeed: im emerald IV they should hire me ill take lcs minimum pay with no benefits
[2:03:22] Jeankof: isn't DK challengers mid from last year avaliable? i wouldnt be down for it cause young player for young player isnt gonna change things immediately
[2:03:25] Solomonike: @メフィスト exactly so why even look for a different rookie in NACL in the first place
[2:03:32] cozycoffin_: put CoreJJ as a coach
[2:03:38] CouchyHOTS: it's criminal that licorice is teamless
[2:03:40] lec_airport_speedrun: @jeankof the mid got a team, the top though is free
[2:03:45] epicalbawler: @Sprintspeed last summer that almost happened
[2:03:45] Solomonike: let apa finish the split then go from there
[2:03:52] dropsofliquid: If they kick Impact the TL fans will lose their shit
[2:03:53] Ikancast: yeah they have a import slot open they dont even need to change anyone
[2:03:56] dropsofliquid: I'll be one of them
[2:04:05] shewasabulldozer: As an addendum I think it sucks ppl slam a guy for trash talking then losing, these are the same people who complain about how trash talking after wins is weak & bloodless. let players embrace the chance of failure & preserve their confidence anyway.
[2:04:07] Jeankof: @lec_airport_speedrun ah gotcha, hopefully thanatos makes it soon
[2:04:14] shewasabulldozer: vis a vis APA all chatting
[2:04:18] Tunatoogood: TL brand is winning without that what is it
[2:04:19] lec_airport_speedrun: Probably not but we pray
[2:04:22] grandadmiralneckbeard: kicking Impact is the one thing that would obviously just be wrong lol
[2:04:23] Jeankof: bro
[2:04:24] Ikancast: interesting
[2:04:25] Jeankof: what
[2:04:27] nfcpm: i dont think anyone on TL is doing exceptionally. none are worth keeping vs. tossing
[2:04:28] aequorin628: LOL WHAT
[2:04:29] LordAudie: WOW
[2:04:29] dropsofliquid: Ok please don't say that that's so depressing
[2:04:31] Tunatoogood: I guess being in other games
[2:04:32] LordAudie: SPICY
[2:04:38] Nightbot: @shewasabulldozer -> You have to let it go. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[2:04:38] Jeankof: WHY DO I SUPPORT THIS TEAM
[2:04:41] Tameablebread93: ohhhh Inero knows what he's doing I love it
[2:04:42] artvandelay32: there's no way TL makes worlds with this roster, no?
[2:04:43] OG_Plumwick: river lico clears umti impact
[2:04:43] Sprintspeed: they chose umti over river??
[2:04:50] SevTST: I don't think anyone finds Impact or Umti to be the problem.
[2:04:50] Gryffinn: inspired said he thought umti was best jg besides him
[2:04:53] Padlin: wow inero what's your opinion on river? surely you aren't biased at all :)
[2:04:54] LordAudie: Steve pls?
[2:04:59] cozycoffin_: Umti is better than River doe?
[2:05:01] epicalbawler: impact and umti are not the problem
[2:05:03] Padlin: not that you're wrong
[2:05:04] Drazian: WHAT? why would they not want licorice??? who wouldn't want him?
[2:05:05] Padlin: just funny
[2:05:06] epicalbawler: what a cringe take lol
[2:05:08] dropsofliquid: River might have been worse at TL though if they had bad vibes
[2:05:17] aerosbroadbunny: Watch PROS
[2:05:17] shewasabulldozer: they didn’t want river or Licorice is truly baffling. I can somewhat understand impact as a safer bet than Licorice, but river is a clear contender for best JG in the league
[2:05:20] inero: I think they already had impact by that point
[2:05:21] inero: So
[2:05:24] inero: No licorice
[2:05:30] inero: which is fine
[2:05:31] ProteusWest: I think Licorice is good, but having Impact is never bad either, so I can see that
[2:05:31] aerosbroadbunny: Inspired breaks this all down
[2:05:33] inero: dont want to back down from a deal
[2:05:41] julianlearning: lico qq
[2:05:42] Drazian: thats fair
[2:05:52] artvandelay32: @epicalbawler HLL community is always down on non-NA players it's why i barely watch anymore tbh
[2:05:58] Tameablebread93: also it's impact who is no slouch. That's not as bad imo
[2:06:06] JoGOAT_Bahh: Love how you can always recognize a TL fan by them wanting the whole team replaced if they aren't first
[2:06:15] ProteusWest: I think it's interesting to hear Inspired talk and give opinions, but just because he speaks with authority and confidence doesn't mean he's right on everything
[2:06:24] Jeankof: Also importing KR at top and jgl last year was troll no? two stacked roles for NA standards and we decide to import those instead of the carry positions
[2:06:27] cr0ckp0tt: who gives  a fuck about him
[2:06:28] nfcpm: i think APA could be a great person to build around.
[2:06:29] shewasabulldozer: @proteuswest yeah and ppl keep forgetting Licorice was bad for a long time. I love Licorice to bits but you can guarantee Impact will play well no matter what. Licorice didn’t have that assurance, he’d be a risk
[2:06:31] thoughtfulcoconut: well when the non-NA players suck a softball through a straw, what do you expect
[2:06:34] SkyeTheX: Let's go to emote only during takes xD
[2:06:38] VeteranEU: you lost NA viewership to non-NA players, probably a bit more important
[2:06:40] dropsofliquid: He also said he doesn't watch the show. He's like the LEC caller earlier
[2:06:42] Ikancast: do you think messi can play mid lane
[2:06:42] cozycoffin_: BRING DANNY BACK :(
[2:06:42] urgotabekidding: @ProteusWest I mean, I'd take the opinion of the best jungler on the league on who's the second best in the league over randos in this chat
[2:06:43] slumdo666: Based Kelsey
[2:06:44] Drazian: again just pointing to wahat makes me so mad about GG dipping when they did instead of doing soin a timeframe that wouldve allowed the players more time to lock into another team/deal
[2:06:45] SevTST: No one wants imports who aren't going to stick around. Which is never a bad spot.
[2:06:53] Bearus_Aurelius: if LCS went to a Regional Remote approach, NA talent would be much more appreciated
[2:06:55] Bearus_Aurelius: imo
[2:06:57] lec_airport_speedrun: @travis can I jump in to make the case that diable is 10x the ADC Hans Sama ever could be
[2:06:57] onetrueshawn: he's an importer exporter
[2:07:03] slumdo666: Vandalay Industries
[2:07:06] grandadmiralneckbeard: I fucking love non-NA players. I wish all of LCS was imports. I wish LCS was just LCK CL casted by Flowers
[2:07:09] Dayspringg: 0 patience na copers always want to change the roster at the first sign of any issues
[2:07:14] SevTST: Which is probably why I feel the need to fight anyone who says bad things about Impact or CoreJJ.
[2:07:20] ThankQu: let’s be honest, most non-NA players who come to LCS are washed mercenaries
[2:07:23] C9Jack: licorice to mid for TL imo
[2:07:25] SevTST: They didn't abandon us, so we shouldn't abandon them.
[2:07:29] ProteusWest: @urgotabekidding probably, but there are a lot of smart analysts and a lot of players and coaches who say a lot of things very definitively and who are dead wrong
[2:07:37] Dayspringg: @C9Jack fudge experiment take 2
[2:07:37] artvandelay32: @Dayspringg TL fans have been waiting a long time to win LCS to be fair (i am not one of them)
[2:07:40] epicalbawler: i think its pretty insane people think tl needs to change. both of their games this week were close
[2:07:40] brazend1: @ThankQu no one goes to NA to win, just for a paycheck
[2:07:45] shewasabulldozer: @grandadmiralneckbeard welcome new C9 roster: BrokenBlade Yike Caps Hans Mikyx
[2:08:02] LCSEevee: TL will probably change mid
[2:08:02] cozycoffin_: APA can grow too
[2:08:03] poe_viewer: imports who come are usually washed, yes, but most of them are still better than these so called "NA talent" lol
[2:08:06] Archique: What is a reasonable amount of time to give someone to improve? 3 splits? 1 year?
[2:08:07] shewasabulldozer: drop UmTi for Dardoch and they’re sorted
[2:08:08] grandadmiralneckbeard: @shewasabulldozer music to my ears. Now they can lose to NRG more times per year
[2:08:09] julianlearning: licorice mid on TL imo imo
[2:08:11] cozycoffin_: give APA a full year to grow
[2:08:11] ixbx: if quad is avail, I grab that no hesitation
[2:08:14] Jeankof: i just dont see any point in replacing Apa mid season for another young player who we'll just ship off at the end of summer, unless you can get a immediate auto win mid dont bother rn, let Apa play
[2:08:14] LCSEevee: If they make any changes
[2:08:17] shewasabulldozer: @grandadmiralneckbeard lmfao
[2:08:20] steph_curry_no1_fan: @epicalbawler i mean if TL wants to keep coming 4th or smth they should stay the same but its clear so far they can't compete with the top of the league
[2:08:25] Solomonike: Do the haeri effect have the mfight for spot again
[2:08:47] SevTST: It'd be nice if APA was doing better, but... I mean... He's not. Just like there's no reason to replace APA for just any old import... There's not a reason to keep APA just because he's NA.
[2:08:50] imhei: Quad, Quid and Quas walk into a bar
[2:08:52] SevTST: That goes both ways.
[2:09:03] Prophet181: he'll have had a split and a half more accurately
[2:09:06] Archique: @SevTST agreed
[2:09:09] epicalbawler: @steph_curry_no1_fan the games were close and u say they cant compete
[2:09:14] Tunatoogood: APA would def be better on a diff team
[2:09:17] nfcpm: i think most Flyquest Challenger players would be an upgrade for half or more of the teams in the LCS
[2:09:27] Dayspringg: APA getting the Contractz treatment...
[2:09:29] ProteusWest: you never know, Fakegod is back
[2:09:29] shewasabulldozer: C9 should drop jojo for APA
[2:09:43] rosiestofthorns: @shewasabulldozer LOL
[2:09:47] epicalbawler: lose 2 close best of ones against last years finalists with an inting mid laner and tl is somehow not able to compete xDD? apa no int = they probably win
[2:09:51] slumdo666: Tru tho, APA would probably look better on another team
[2:09:59] メフィスト: @Tunatoogood i'm not sure about this, TL sets him up for success. he might have less pressure on him on a different team which would make him play better though, since a lot of his current problems are unforced errors
[2:10:01] grandadmiralneckbeard: or maybe TL and C9 should make a trade? For the content
[2:10:03] jacklgrey: tripling down on CoreGG
[2:10:06] poe_viewer: we talk about apa and yeon, but core has looked abysmal for a few years now
[2:10:07] Solomonike: if you do that do you even keep core then?
[2:10:08] SevTST: They'd like Core and Impact pick the roster. Lol
[2:10:09] ProteusWest: and Fakegod deserved his shot again, it's unfortunate that it's not working out for him
[2:10:09] dropsofliquid: Man I'd rather they just lose & stop changing so many players
[2:10:10] cozycoffin_: remember when EVERYONE was saying the SAME thing about Palafaker
[2:10:15] slumdo666: Yeah dump the whole LCK thing

[2:10:27] artvandelay32: how many years since TL last won LCS?
[2:10:29] deekomode: KEKW
[2:10:31] magregs: Licorice - Spica - Quad - Zven - import kr, coach: corejj
[2:10:33] ThankQu: watch umti go back to Korea next year
[2:10:34] C9Jack: TL got to worlds
[2:10:35] Sprintspeed: yea what about the core fraud allegations Kappa
[2:10:36] aequorin628: @shewasabulldozer Nah just role swap jojo to toplane
[2:10:36] Jeankof: i hope he stays as a coach if he doesnt play
[2:10:37] shewasabulldozer: TL should blow up the roster, keep Impact and CoreJJ, and add Santorin, Jensen, and Doublelift . just a thought
[2:10:39] Tunatoogood: Core just isn't as dominant as he used to be
[2:10:41] grandadmiralneckbeard: If Core underperforms, and TL wants to replace him, maybe Olleh? He's actually so good, but is suffering on IMT
[2:10:41] Padlin: i'm a core hater
[2:10:41] epicalbawler: BigBrother
[2:10:42] Dayspringg: Core needs thresh to be meta
[2:10:44] erebus089: core is washsed
[2:10:47] C9Jack: Travis hates everyone
[2:10:50] erebus089: simply put
[2:10:54] cozycoffin_: KEEP TL ROSTER THEY ARE GOOD LET THEM COOK

[2:10:55] C9Jack: equally
[2:10:59] shewasabulldozer: @aequorin628 ooohhh brilliant. and TL can have the return of Fudge mid
[2:10:59] brazend1: core is worse than ignar
[2:11:03] nfcpm: I think CoreJJ is hurting his own legacy by playing on a meh team
[2:11:05] SevTST: I don't care if Core is washed.
[2:11:08] SevTST: He gets a pass.
[2:11:10] kerokerogrips: agreed, we need to also talk about core jj
[2:11:10] dropsofliquid: @shewasabulldozer Would this be the oldest roster ever
[2:11:12] slumdo666: What do Core and my dishes have in common?
[2:11:20] twizna: they're dirty
[2:11:25] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:11:27] vilhelmq: @slumdo666 clean
[2:11:33] Tameablebread93: I think that's very well put
[2:11:37] rosiestofthorns: Would Mask be better on TL over Apa?
[2:11:38] epicalbawler: travis is BigBrother
[2:11:39] Jeankof: who do you replace core with assuming TL's ambitions
[2:11:41] grandadmiralneckbeard: I love Core, so I'd be sad to see him go. But also, he has had some really sus moments the past few years lol
[2:11:44] shewasabulldozer: @dropsofliquid the mummies are rising from their tombs
[2:11:58] Hookwinked: Core99jj
[2:11:58] vilhelmq: Would you like to see him as a positional coach, then?
[2:11:59] ixbx: I could see Core shifting to a coach
[2:12:00] Dayspringg: Core should def coach if thheres no roster spot tbh
[2:12:00] aerosbroadbunny: I want to see Shopify revamp roster to Licorice, Spica, Insanity, Zven, Zeyzal
[2:12:00] kerokerogrips: core and my dishes are thrown away when they are broken and dont work anymore
[2:12:00] Jeankof: YES
[2:12:02] poe_viewer: BERYL MY GOAT
[2:12:03] Tunatoogood: Holy beryl TL
[2:12:04] grandadmiralneckbeard: @Jeankof Olleh
[2:12:07] leagueofemily: lmaooooo
[2:12:08] deekomode: BASED MY GOAT
[2:12:08] cozycoffin_: CoreJJ is a neutral player he doesn't INT games lately but he doesn't carry anything he is still top 3 SUP
[2:12:11] thoughtfulcoconut: TL KEllin
[2:12:12] shewasabulldozer: CoreJJ needs to move to Dignitas and role swap to ADC. it is the way
[2:12:21] ProteusWest: I can't imagine how much Beryl would cost if SwordArt cost 6 million
[2:12:21] Archique: Beryl cooks wayyy too much for TL. Now Shopify however.....
[2:12:22] The_Blaze83: i was thinking the same thing travis
[2:12:23] LCSEevee: Okey but TL beryl would go so hard
[2:12:30] Jeankof: @grandadmiralneckbeard oh true fair, wouldn't be hard at all to pry from Imt now that you mention it
[2:12:32] twizna: @cozycoffin_ this imo
[2:12:32] shewasabulldozer: @thoughtfulcoconut TL need a six man roster w Kellin and Bible
[2:12:38] MattySocials: love to see it
[2:12:44] epicalbawler: @LCSEevee stop ur making me hard
[2:12:54] inero: @LCSEevee NO !
[2:12:56] danada389: Time for market research!
[2:13:02] slumdo666: A quick survey
[2:13:09] Jeankof: TL Beryl gets steve his worlds
[2:13:09] grandadmiralneckbeard: Actually, now that I think about it, just wait for IMT to ship off this roster and snap up Olleh and Mask
[2:13:15] steph_curry_no1_fan: beryl hardly plays soloq already, in na soloq environment beryl might not touch league of legends ever and become a genshin impact or smth
[2:13:19] magregs: @travisgafford I enjoy the editorial content much more
[2:13:25] Archique: We could also look at Ignar angle again. Drop Core, let Ignar get the double-round trip
[2:13:35] LCSEevee: Beryl would play genshin. Go stage. Win. Play genshin
[2:13:35] shewasabulldozer: @archique new SR roster: Bwipo Blaber Insanity Tactical Beryl. it’s time to burn the kitchen down
[2:13:37] urgotabekidding: Pros such a novel idea :D
[2:13:38] Hookwinked: Interviews havent been the same since Appolo left
[2:13:40] grandadmiralneckbeard: @steph_curry_no1_fan Which means he's immune to the corrosive effects of NA soloq :D
[2:13:40] メフィスト: beryl doesn't play solo q so he won't get contaminated by NA debuff gigabrain
[2:13:46] nfcpm: yeah talking to QTCinderella about her awards show is less interesting than your editorials
[2:13:52] kerokerogrips: interviews are plain when the players are plain as well
[2:13:53] poe_viewer: Beryl said in his stream he'll never leave Korea unless he gets an insane bag in china
[2:13:58] Padlin: this just in: players are really boring people
[2:13:59] Jeankof: Nah Beryl wouldn't come after the rumors of the offers he rejected in offseason
[2:14:01] brazend1: @kerokerogrips snoozefest
[2:14:11] Archique: @shewasabulldozer The word Meta puts a dollar in the jar on that team lol
[2:14:11] poe_viewer: during last off season
[2:14:14] shewasabulldozer: @poe_viewer it’s fine just sign up with the crypto money
[2:14:23] leagueofemily: not so coincidentally Kelsey and I had a conversation about the state of esports journalism on MAKING THE ROUNDS recently :3
[2:14:25] shewasabulldozer: @archique lmao
[2:14:25] grandadmiralneckbeard: @Jeankof wait wtf, people are actually trying to import Beryl? Actually?
[2:14:26] magregs: @travisgafford your long form interviews are my favorite content!
[2:14:26] lec_airport_speedrun: @jeankof you make him the offer he can't refuse: a genshin sponsorship
[2:14:41] razlol: SHOUT OUT YOUR NEW SUBS YOU TRAVIS
[2:14:45] ProteusWest: there is a lot more interview content out there too
[2:14:47] Padlin: @leagueofemily i bet this is a really POSTIVE conversation :)))
[2:14:49] lolflailure: there are less games, literally less to talk about
[2:14:50] kerokerogrips: the obly interesting interview i saw was the one caedrel gave to jabkos after lec finals,
[2:15:03] ProteusWest: I would love to see more Riot interviews
[2:15:04] grandadmiralneckbeard: grandadmiralneckbeard subscribed with Prime. 
[2:15:08] karonmoser: @leagueofemily MAKING THE ROUNDS OMG WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?
[2:15:15] shewasabulldozer: @leagueofemily maybe I’m misreading this but I’m starting to pick up subtle hints that people should tune in to award winning show MAKING THE ROUNDS
[2:15:19] Tameablebread93: They are really good quality
[2:15:20] leagueofemily: @lec_airport_speedrun give him the triple threat of a hoyo sponsorship of HSR, HI3, Genshin
[2:15:20] Jeankof: @grandadmiralneckbeard nah there was something about Beryl turning down GenG offer at some point cause of vibes or something, i need to look at it again to remember clearly tho
[2:15:21] GodzillaGuerilla: they are amazing

[2:15:59] Padlin: raz gifted a sub to inero?
[2:15:59] Sprintspeed: @leagueofemily what are your thoughts on Jacob Wolf's take that all the LCS players have boring life stories being rich kids from privilege so viewers aren't interested?
[2:16:01] nfcpm: way to call out raz
[2:16:01] Teckno7: lmao
[2:16:01] slumdo666: Lmaoooo
[2:16:02] grandadmiralneckbeard: @Jeankof ah ok. I mean, I think going from Delight to Beryl would have been tragic
[2:16:04] lec_airport_speedrun: @leagueofemily exactly, he cannot refuse that offer, don't even make him scrim either, he just plays from home on matchdays
[2:16:05] Jeankof: @poe_viewer yea pretty much that was what it was

[2:17:41] メフィスト: is he going to make the same argument about gumayusi
[2:17:42] dropsofliquid: Nvm boomers don't play anymore this is not a boomer take
[2:17:44] urgotabekidding: never was a thing for league
[2:17:46] shewasabulldozer: the best way to revive western viewership is to bring back the statefarm superarena
[2:17:49] Bearus_Aurelius: this is a really good idea
[2:17:50] RlDennis: Do teams still have subs? if so, with the change to pre-recording the draft. Is there a world in which draft is done 'blind' for both teams, not knowing if they're going up against the sub or not (for champion diversity sake?)
[2:17:51] thoughtfulcoconut: they used to
[2:17:57] numiiigoesrawrz: take: to bring back western viewership, put the games in the client
[2:18:01] VeteranEU: @travisgafford this is the most addict-brained thing I've read in a hot minute
[2:18:03] ixbx: @SwedeBeGoode dang actually in Sweden? ur always around for the show, 4AM start time rouuuuugh
[2:18:04] 붼이토: we used to be able to spectate
[2:18:04] evies_: swede is based
[2:18:11] LCSEevee: Bro the client crashes from pressing the play button and now we are getting vanguard rn as well. Client will use more of my pc than release pubg
[2:18:30] Prophet181: are we saying embedding is the way to save LCS?
[2:18:35] C9Jack: C9Jack is gifting 10 Tier 1 Subs to travisgafford's community! They've gifted a total of 150 in the channel!

[2:18:45] deekomode: POG
[2:18:46] cozycoffin_: woot woot
[2:18:46] Ikancast: they do it sometimes
[2:18:47] Tunatoogood: Pog.
[2:18:48] LCSEevee: Dodged*
[2:18:49] Jeankof: I thought they did
[2:18:49] Zerotu14: DODGED EZ
[2:18:49] urgotabekidding: They still do sometimes, it just isn't the default main page
[2:18:50] Sprintspeed: PogChamp @C9Jack
[2:18:51] Cubbyxx: Thanks @C9Jack
[2:18:52] legendofivan: i wonder if they'd call them rush hour in 2024
[2:18:52] lec_airport_speedrun: Didn't they have quests in the client for watching pro
[2:18:54] Jeankof: i saw it last year
[2:18:55] rosiestofthorns: JACK coming in BIG
[2:18:57] SevTST: Wait... They called them Rush Hour?
[2:18:58] slackstacker: they do it for worlds
[2:19:05] urgotabekidding: You have to be on the ESPORTS tab
[2:19:05] ixbx: thanks for supporting the show @C9Jack
[2:19:06] Dayspringg: thhey show a slide with a link when it is live
[2:19:06] DaniGrim: C9 is bootstrapping TGI and not just LCS :P
[2:19:06] slackstacker: i havent seen it as frequently as before
[2:19:06] rosiestofthorns: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:19:07] C9Jack: sneakyJack
[2:19:14] iamelvis4: Its on the client
[2:19:14] Bearus_Aurelius: they DO advertise on the client
[2:19:17] SallieMae: there's no way the called them rush hour
[2:19:25] Jeankof: Its so good
[2:19:26] thoughtfulcoconut: you cant watch it in client though AFAIK, then it opens your browser if im correct
[2:19:27] urgotabekidding: ESPORTS tab should be default landing spot for weekends
[2:19:28] nfcpm: lol
[2:19:33] razlol: val esports tab is insane
[2:19:35] bassnasty: its very obvious and nice in valorant
[2:19:35] vilhelmq: of fucking course it is
[2:19:35] cultLeader_: its great
[2:19:37] Jeankof: yes
[2:19:41] cultLeader_: yes
[2:19:44] deekomode: yes
[2:19:44] slumdo666: Riots marketing for the LCS is pretty barebones
[2:19:46] vilhelmq: Valorant favourite child once again
[2:19:47] ProteusWest: it used to be home page back in the day
[2:19:49] dropsofliquid: I failed the Valorant tutorial that's a tough game
[2:19:50] GodzillaGuerilla: hope mark stopped the stream, inero keeps destroying lcs hahaha
[2:20:00] shewasabulldozer: @razlol but can it compete with the closet? didn’t think so.
[2:20:08] VerbalHorse: Just put it on the front page of client and give out 1 RNG orb for watching a game and viewership will triple
[2:20:09] Tunatoogood: People will click the tab at least once
[2:20:10] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[2:20:11] grandadmiralneckbeard: Classic, Riot doing everything differently (read: better) in Val, but refusing to do it in League for reasons
[2:20:17] steph_curry_no1_fan: what if we delete aram, urf, tft arena everything and only leave summoners rift to condense viewership. then we wont have ppl watching aram streamers or tft streamers everyone will be forced to watch lcs great idea imo
[2:20:18] urgotabekidding: I never navigate client tabs at all.  There are currently 6 tabs available.
[2:20:18] cultLeader_: val client is way better
[2:20:23] Drazian: come on guys, riot barely marketed LoR, you think they wanna spend money like that?
[2:20:24] deekomode: i think the valorant team might be more on top of it rather than league
[2:20:25] brazend1: theres only like 5 tabs in val
[2:20:28] VeteranEU: 18 month predictions are the best. If you're wrong, nobody will ever know.
[2:20:35] bassnasty: the team guns on that tab is so good
[2:20:36] grandadmiralneckbeard: Just put one of those annoying TFT yellow notif thingies on the tab, and I'll have to click it
[2:20:36] Jeankof: Valorant has better integration across the board, theyre actively trying
[2:20:51] iamelvis4: It does for me
[2:20:55] thoughtfulcoconut: They advertise it in client but clicking it takes you to browser
[2:20:58] womboboys: League client is jank. Everything should in game like Valorant, DOTA2
[2:21:00] shewasabulldozer: @grandadmiralneckbeard evil take.
[2:21:00] Ikancast: its the load in screen for me at times, probably only on weekends
[2:21:07] Bearus_Aurelius: The LCS is front and Center on the Client on game days. it is not hidden by a tab
[2:21:08] SallieMae: doesnt league already have that
[2:21:08] Jeankof: I remember seeing the Lcs trophy on the opening screen for the client last year, maybe im high tho
[2:21:25] dropsofliquid: @Bearus_Aurelius Ya it is for mine too I swear but maybe I'm crazy?
[2:21:35] ProteusWest: oh my, if TR is the only place where they're advertising the LCS, that's just peak Riot
[2:21:43] Bearus_Aurelius: @travisgafford
[2:21:52] Bearus_Aurelius: client showcases LCS on game days
[2:21:55] Bearus_Aurelius: it is not hidden
[2:21:55] Ikancast: also they are doing that heavenscale and porcelain event right now so i think thats taking priority
[2:21:58] Deathlance: i get a notification 85 times when someone i get report feedback, maybe they could take 84 of those and put it towards lcs
[2:21:59] Jeankof: iits not hidden
[2:22:14] inero: @Bearus_Aurelius I swear it does
[2:22:16] enshero: I think I was high too when I saw the trophy on client screen
[2:22:18] Nightbot: If you have an active Amazon Prime Account you can link it to Twitch Prime & you'll be able to Subscribe to Travis for "Free" every month! These do not automatically re-sub, so remember to check if its available! More details here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[2:22:19] inero: I never tab to this page but I always see it
[2:22:29] Bearus_Aurelius: @inero it does 100%
[2:22:34] Sprintspeed: speaking of r6 maybe riot just needs to pay jynxzi to costream the lcs
[2:22:37] Drazian: they do indeed do it on game days
[2:22:40] dropsofliquid: Ya same. Maybe it varies by accounts who have interacted with it or something?
[2:22:44] Jeankof: i geniunely remember seeing blaber with the lcs trophy multiple teams upon opening client last year
[2:22:46] dropsofliquid: Is that even possible?
[2:22:51] Drazian: but they used to do more hype stuff pre game days
[2:22:57] dropsofliquid: @Jeankof Ok same I saw Blaber for sure
[2:23:03] deekomode: o
[2:23:05] ProteusWest: lol
[2:23:06] leagueofemily: lmao
[2:23:08] womboboys: OMEGALUL
[2:23:10] P4llace: i was like wtf
[2:23:11] deekomode: thought it was me lol
[2:23:11] Grimprospect: I was like wtf lol
[2:23:16] evies_: so when i was playing fortnite a while back they shilled FNCS pretty hard, but as someone with 0 existing buyin in the scene there was still no compelling reason to actually click in to watch. i do think the actual broadcast is necessary so that you can actually show what the broadcast is actually like
[2:23:16] Drazian: lmao i thought it was my own pc
[2:23:19] メフィスト: i wonder if it's a regional issue, i'm pretty sure they do have worlds advertised in client
[2:23:22] Bearus_Aurelius: to the callers point though, being able watch the game in client while in queue would be cool
[2:23:31] Grimprospect: @P4llace jinx homie
[2:23:39] pikaruuuuu: I mean the riot client isn't the best lol
[2:23:42] thoughtfulcoconut: riot should do any kind of promotion for the LCS to be fair. how do you expect your product to grow when you dont market it in this day and age
[2:23:49] nfcpm: the riot client is telling travis he hasn't updated in 5 years
[2:24:08] Archique: It def does
[2:24:17] matthew0zz: it does
[2:24:19] ProteusWest: what I'd like to see is them aggressively marketing LCS in the client after Arcane Season 2 starts
[2:24:22] womboboys: Yeah they do.
[2:24:24] Jeankof: it does do tho, they had blaber last year
[2:24:29] iamelvis4: How many people have to type it does?
[2:24:29] onetrueshawn: it definitely does
[2:24:30] Ikancast: it does for me 100%
[2:24:33] Archique: Or I play this game 3 hours every day....
[2:24:33] aequorin628: It does tho?
[2:24:36] womboboys: Nah brah, saw it this weekend. You stoned.
[2:24:38] Pita26: Back in the day it was the main thing on the client. It's literally how I learned about LCS/worlds
[2:24:43] epicalbawler: travis embarassing himself rn
[2:24:44] saltycurry8D: it does
[2:24:49] Bearus_Aurelius: I just logged into client yesterday and it had the LCS schedule right there when you log in
[2:24:50] dropsofliquid: Could it vary by person?
[2:24:52] VerbalHorse: same lul
[2:24:54] shewasabulldozer: @thoughtfulcoconut ritualistic magicks , dark covenants with imports and sacrificing EG for divine favour, I think
[2:24:55] aequorin628: LCS isn't on bro
[2:24:55] Archique: How we getting gaslit by someone that doesnt even play the game lol
[2:24:59] grandadmiralneckbeard: @nfcpm tbf, the client told me a couple of days, very excitedly, that "runes are reforged!"
[2:25:00] Bearus_Aurelius: they only do it on gamedays
[2:25:01] LCSEevee: Im perma in lobby i don't see the esports tab
[2:25:02] togabob: I saw it yesterday
[2:25:03] Jeankof: i didnt even know there was an esports tab
[2:25:07] Pita26: It definitely disappeared at one point in time, but I've been free from playing for like a year now.
[2:25:08] womboboys: Big True
[2:25:09] linuscalling: !reward
[2:25:18] matthew0zz: you get skin from watching twitch or esport website?
[2:25:28] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:25:28] Paulo_Ai: what a cool guy
[2:25:41] vilhelmq: @matthew0zz lolesports, not twitch
[2:25:47] ixbx: Sat i got 1 drop, sunday I got 4. After turning off my adblocker on the site I started to get them
[2:25:49] VeteranEU: Why doesn't LPL, the largest of the regions, not simply eat the other three?
[2:25:54] Jeankof: its monday
[2:25:55] grandadmiralneckbeard: @matthew0zz you get a chance of receiving drops from the lolesports site
[2:25:57] togabob: the client show it as the main page sat sun
[2:25:57] slumdo666: Lol fr
[2:26:00] womboboys: Travis Iron rank at League Client
[2:26:03] dropsofliquid: But it's monday today
[2:26:04] matthew0zz: never getting drops then seeing twitch chat is funny
[2:26:04] onetrueshawn: it shows it when it's live
[2:26:08] VerbalHorse: @VeteranEU LUL
[2:26:12] aequorin628: I don't think LCS on rn Travis
[2:26:13] cozycoffin_: maybe LCS should just win worlds. I think most Americans don't like watching their region get gapped every year.
[2:26:23] Cubbyxx: LELCSLPLCK
[2:26:27] matthew0zz: people go straight to play again
[2:26:30] onetrueshawn: check when live
[2:26:33] Bearus_Aurelius: @Cubbyxx is right though, at least bring back challenger spectate
[2:26:33] grandadmiralneckbeard: @VeteranEU we'd never be done with the round robin
[2:26:36] numiiigoesrawrz: LELCSLPLCKLLA
[2:26:38] ProteusWest: if only a company had data on what people click
[2:26:38] nfcpm: this episode tripled the metrics
[2:26:41] iamelvis4: omg...that sounds like stuff Travis complained about in the past not existing
[2:26:53] Sprintspeed: do you think being able to spectate the game through in-game spectator mode like dota help?
[2:26:55] matthew0zz: live videos
[2:26:56] shewasabulldozer: @cozycoffin_ why does LCS not simply send teams that will beat the East in bo5s? Are they stupid?
[2:27:03] SevTST: @cozycoffin_ Tell that to all of us who watch US Soccer... Or literally half of the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL team fans.
[2:27:03] LCSEevee: LENAKRCNCS
[2:27:04] matthew0zz: live videos bro
[2:27:06] LordAudie: how do they promote the sponsor on the client?
[2:27:08] ProteusWest: lol
[2:27:09] deekomode: HAHA
[2:27:11] razlol: azael does that
[2:27:11] numiiigoesrawrz: LMAOOOO
[2:27:13] vilhelmq: LUL
[2:27:13] P4llace: HAHAHHA
[2:27:14] ProteusWest: PLAY IT
[2:27:14] leagueofemily: aram with azael
[2:27:15] womboboys: BASED AZAEL
[2:27:17] c9_bobby: yooo aram stream?
[2:27:19] Hookwinked: Riot runs LCS games through the league client via skype
[2:27:19] Archique: They should just add a "earn free loot by clicking" then it uses Vanguard to set lolesports as default browser home screen
[2:27:20] Pita26: It's 100% possible
[2:27:22] imshades: It used to send you to watch lolesports website from the client
[2:27:24] cozycoffin_: @shewasabulldozer lcs leadership doesnt care about worlds
[2:27:24] numiiigoesrawrz: THE CHONCC PLUSH IS SO GOOD
[2:27:25] theemarkz: azael fastest aram invite in the west
[2:27:27] VeteranEU: OK I know how to get viewership back: excessive cross-dressing by the desk and the commissioner
[2:27:31] VeteranEU: just look at Sneaky's numbers
[2:27:34] deekomode: azael not even watching hll? aram only BASED
[2:27:39] razlol: if azael sees you alive he will invite you to an aram
[2:27:41] Paulo_Ai: just stream some arams thats the 4FUN meta
[2:27:42] brazend1: travis should pivot to val
[2:27:45] evies_: @ whoever the product manager is for the lcs client, please move 'leaguesports in client' up one ranking in the jira backlog
[2:27:46] numiiigoesrawrz: @razlol wanna aram?
[2:27:50] dropsofliquid: I did go from watching league to playing league :D
[2:27:56] ProteusWest: I need to get Azael on my friends list, I'd play ARAMS with him
[2:27:56] razlol: im playing persona 3 atm
[2:27:58] Sokired: azael is amazing
[2:28:01] LordAudie: how do the sponsors get on the client? how do I know about the redbull baron on client?
[2:28:01] theemarkz: my elemental lux cosplay 2 years ago did not move the needle @VeteranEU
[2:28:09] numiiigoesrawrz: bring kangas back as star guardian braum
[2:28:10] メフィスト: they could probably do it if they wanted to, considering how it is possible to embed twitch
