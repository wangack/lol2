[2:09:59] vegandiamond: isnt that an album
[2:10:00] MoodyTheSeventh: easier to get to
[2:10:01] yabootybutt: the moon has water in the form of frozen ice caps on the poles
[2:10:06] KiiroTwo: the moon is not a planet and its not got much of anything of value. but a little moon base could be cool
[2:10:09] bladetrinity16: but that doesnt mean we cant just send water or make water
[2:10:09] Tsdninjaking: @stunt cant wait for pluto to win worlds XD
[2:10:17] vegandiamond: more expensive
[2:10:19] helgore2: moon has cheese
[2:10:21] czekczek1: more expensive
[2:10:23] KiiroTwo: well... the cost of travel would def be more
[2:10:24] uselessaccountnamehere: water exists on all sides of the moon
[2:10:26] Telperion16: more expensive first, then dirt cheap
[2:10:29] MoodyTheSeventh: money won't matter on the moon
[2:10:31] ChromaKhroma: u have to import everything from a literal different planet
[2:10:37] vogue_hommes: hawaii is expensive because of how far everything is, imagine the moon
[2:10:40] KiiroTwo: and if u lived on the moon and worked on earth, the commute would prob be a little annoying
[2:10:40] MoodyTheSeventh: you get what you get lol
[2:10:45] Telperion16: Like how america was super expensive to settle in New Amsterdam but then moving to the west was so cheap
[2:11:25] KiiroTwo: nuclear radiation is pretty chill, id vibe with it to save a few bucks
[2:11:29] czekczek1: is smolder a scaling champ? don't see much of him
[2:11:38] Tsdninjaking: id imagine gravity wouldnt be much of an issue TBH
[2:11:39] NicVilll: awwww smolders a fan
[2:11:41] bladetrinity16: @czekczek1 yes
[2:11:48] Tsdninjaking: couldnt they just make pressureized bases
[2:11:49] Telperion16: I would rather be a radiation goblin on earth than some fancy pants normal human on the moon Madge
[2:11:57] czekczek1: big fan!
[2:12:04] KiiroTwo: just lower gravity, its still there. everything is just 1/6th the weight. also, the moon has less atmosphere so radiation would be a lot more
[2:12:04] czekczek1: @bladetrinity16 thanks owoSpin
[2:12:08] BaneBladeV: peepoCute what if we fed together
[2:12:09] NicVilll: smolder getting the free lp janna
[2:12:09] uselessaccountnamehere: lack of gravity has negative effects on muscles and bone denisty
