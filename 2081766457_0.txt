[0:17:21] braygdh: boring playstyle from rammus
[0:17:44] Dursti: yeah thats more or less what xin does ^^
[0:20:51] NemilliaLol: Why do octopus have 3 hearts
[0:21:32] Zoephobia: octopodes are so cool
[0:21:56] Zoephobia: octopi is technically incorrect
[0:22:03] NemilliaLol: So do they still be fine if 1 of the 3 cease to function
[0:22:05] Zoephobia: it would be the latin declination of the "o" ending
[0:22:12] braygdh: is LEC back this weekend or the next one?
[0:22:26] itsReecers: @braygdh 9th
[0:22:31] Zoephobia: but octopus from the greek foot, so the plural is podes
[0:22:32] braygdh: oh ok, thank you
[0:22:47] Zoephobia: (same as podiatrist)
[0:23:11] NemilliaLol: Can you give us a random doctor fact that is interesting and not a lot know about
[0:23:31] Little_xWing: babus viewer
[0:23:32] itsReecers: rammus is such a fair champ
[0:23:33] braygdh: how gross is that LOL
[0:23:51] Zoephobia: octopuses is correct english
[0:23:56] Zoephobia: octopodes is correct greek
[0:24:07] Zoephobia: octopi is wrong in all languages and I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT
[0:24:24] Zoephobia: calling it: malaria story
[0:24:39] scratterboon: COMMUNISM
[0:24:58] NemilliaLol: Man that sounds interesting surely i can type it out to learn more about it
[0:25:07] Seishoon: crescents? crescent guard? is that a league refference?
[0:25:30] braygdh: this miku song is so good
[0:25:37] Laan_c: ok google search melerya webmd
[0:25:40] itsReecers: thats such an iconic but random fact
[0:25:46] Zoephobia: it is cool
[0:26:22] NemilliaLol: Nah get LDR xdd
[0:26:48] itsReecers: imagine having a team
[0:27:56] NemilliaLol: Why is it cheaper to say bye than to say hi when "bye" clearly have more characters and need more effort to write
[0:28:21] Sgt_RubberStallion: is runaans change on pbe right now? i tried but it still said ranged only
[0:28:22] scratterboon: also, cold weather increases frequency sickling crisis, so people in subsaharan Africa less likely to have issues with sickle cell
[0:28:53] Sgt_RubberStallion: man i wanted to try it on ekko lol
[0:29:23] Zoephobia: FirstTimeChadder
[0:29:42] ounceoffloof: sometimes you loose game
[0:29:49] Little_xWing: just stall rammus under turret for 45 seconds and he should be low enough to kill 5Head
[0:30:24] Seishoon: what elo is this?
[0:30:44] itsReecers: rammus balanced
[0:30:54] NemilliaLol: We can learn how to kill a Rammus when there is no AP available
[0:30:58] FoxyLuxana: @Sgt_RubberStallion they canceled the changes
[0:31:57] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted
[0:32:29] itsReecers: i was about to scream if u targetted rammus
[0:32:52] NemilliaLol: Not really i just think its a team diff consider how bot still lost after Smolder kill
[0:32:59] MaraudingBacon: just so you know medic. sounds like you are bouncing your need against the table. its audible.
[0:33:25] Seishoon: looks kinda like emerald elo
[0:33:33] MaraudingBacon: (yes i know its the song not the knee)
[0:33:55] NemilliaLol: In lore?
[0:33:58] NemilliaLol: Or in game
[0:34:01] TawaanH: his tank build is pretty amazing right now
[0:34:04] Fad3C: zilean is lowkey busted
[0:34:16] Zoephobia: his early is just pretty bad
[0:34:23] Nexusshade: I won as a varus vs lucian. I'm happy ❤️ how are you today medic? VirtualHug
[0:34:27] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:34:27] NemilliaLol: Oh yea it is, besides his Q is clunky to hit sometimes
[0:34:36] AmishPorpoise: oh hes so broken
[0:35:23] itsReecers: gettin the last chances in before vanguard
[0:35:31] FoxyLuxana: also noone can deal with rammus this game
[0:35:41] Zoephobia: bjergsen FeelsStrongMan
[0:35:53] NemilliaLol: The E is as slow as Nasus W, i didn't understand Ls telling people Nasus support was broken last year when Zilean exist
[0:36:04] AmishPorpoise: that builds into lord doms eventually lol
[0:36:06] FoxyLuxana: she is going for anti heal armor pen
[0:36:15] Seishoon: double long sword and agility cloak builds into ldr xD
[0:36:51] Seishoon: she's doing something at least, that gives some armor pen XD
[0:37:43] NemilliaLol: We window
[0:37:52] zjhammer: Blade Maybe?
[0:38:02] Fad3C: if they get mountain soul rammus becomes invulnerable
[0:38:12] Seishoon: but imo in that game you just build kraken, navori, BT, mercurial scimitar and ldr
[0:38:30] Seishoon: tristana just got walmart build
[0:38:50] Zoephobia: rammus GIGACHAD
[0:39:21] NemilliaLol: Man imagine how the game would be if turret shot is true damage
[0:39:26] Seishoon: tristana lacks knowledge xd, she should have nothing to do with rammus. just press scimitar when he goes on her and leave
[0:39:44] Seishoon: go for other targets
[0:40:05] Seishoon: OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT?XXXDDDDD
[0:40:31] Zoephobia: song name?
[0:40:50] FoxyLuxana: @Zoephobia darude - sandstorm
[0:40:51] NemilliaLol: duDudu
[0:41:35] NemilliaLol: How impactful is it if they change turret shots to do true damage and ignore armor
[0:42:00] Seishoon: my take medic is, and  i heard it quite often that focusing on objectives and a farming sometimes is better
[0:43:30] Seishoon: one advice i caan give you is look what drake is first and if your team has prio. if your team ha prio and first drake is smt like cloud just go 3 grubs but if your team has no prio and it's something like mountain drake or ocean or infernal go for drake
[0:43:34] pkab0o: jax
[0:43:41] pkab0o: good couinter  to  trundle
[0:44:17] lord_eread: @NemilliaLol or maybe just let it deal 50% magic damage and 50% physical damage
[0:44:18] pkab0o: overheal on lilia?
[0:45:10] Jptje: have a nice day :)

[0:46:15] Jptje: Aware
[0:46:19] Zoephobia: I started around nocturne release
[0:46:24] Zoephobia: man that fucker was broken lol
[0:46:42] Zoephobia: nah, I got here from caedrel originally
[0:46:57] Fad3C: i've been a league fan since cyanide was playing in fnatic
[0:47:09] Seishoon: average platinum jungler. giving 400 because flash not worth burning XD
[0:47:20] Zoephobia: I remember when dyrus joined TSM and it was the biggest league news
[0:48:00] Seishoon: oh no medic, when you see all enemy team in your jungle you don't anticipate, you get out asap XDDD
[0:48:57] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[0:50:26] Zoephobia: also hold on, we've played an aram together Madge
[0:51:04] Seishoon: you're in plat medic XDDD
[0:51:08] Zoephobia: fair enough
[0:51:16] Seishoon: people are not that smart over herer XD

[0:52:27] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:53:06] Seishoon: well yes but she used  w/q and he was like 100hp and she couldn't do anything but autos and well...that item advantage ges away when she can only auto XD
[0:54:47] Seishoon: smOWOlder
[0:56:13] Dursti: eep
[0:56:28] azerin0: both solo laners moving? thats not a real game ! Kappa
[0:57:05] Seishoon: if you wanna adapt for this elo in jungle medic you gotta try to get objectives as much as you can and try to get your team to follow you at objectives or at least look to get whatever you have mre prio on. if you have prio on nothing try to avoid enemy jungle if your champ can't 1v1 him
[0:57:34] FrostSJ: hey medic! hows your day going? no facecam today?
[0:58:07] FrostSJ: Get well soon then!
[0:59:09] Seishoon: in some cases your champ may need to be able to 1v2 because toplaners in plat tend to not follow to grubs after they push waves, they just stay there at the tower and enemy top comes grubs and thenn you die or need to leave and enemy jg takles all 3 grubs and then they both go top and ur toplaner dies and says jg diff getc and starts running it down XDDDD (happened to me)
[0:59:19] NemilliaLol: he self counter the Janna ult xdd
[0:59:25] NemilliaLol: xdd

[1:35:59] rolexi00: Picking lissandra and not moving with ur jungler is a bit weird
[1:36:03] lec_airport_speedrun: I thought this was ne attempting to do chovy ganeplay
[1:36:16] lec_airport_speedrun: It's just a generally not especially good player
[1:36:33] tac0w0: so breaking a octopus's heart makes it a triple kill? and henlo peeps

[1:44:53] macantor13: @rolexi00 The 30 second cooldown on her ult? No clue tbh

[1:47:02] raxxman: @sp4cebart It does also depend upon your role, jungle sometimes need to be greedy for keeping smite for objectives
