[1:18:26] stanleyCjames: what was your peak in KR?
[1:18:28] HateSpawn: @stanleyCjames it probably is but it's a different playstyle and dzukill prefs the top life. more consistency
[1:18:37] layyzy27: @HateSpawn fighting vs Darius that are bad with their E feels so good
[1:18:44] hyperbola117: toxic good player u can just mute him

[1:19:08] Muffin72: enemy mid kindred otp or what
[1:19:26] Lyvsa: strimmer
[1:19:31] Sawaanoo: dblade is way better imo since u auto so much with yone
[1:19:32] HateSpawn: if he doesnt do anything lv 1-5 then he's throwing the game
[1:19:35] layyzy27: @HateSpawn yes i know what you meant just said my thoughts
[1:19:38] itsmestepup: are you afraid of darius dzu
[1:19:40] ascuane: d shield is a shit item after 2nd base and d blade is insane for most of the game
[1:19:45] Pelagius_Hipbone_: "If DARIUS doesn't do anything lvl 1-3" ICANT
[1:19:48] Muffin72: but what if its ranger on darius
[1:19:49] holymacaroni55: lvl 1 death incoming

[1:23:03] s9jglsuperstar: wp to darius
[1:23:09] HateSpawn: yeah but darius's potential to carry the game is relatively low if he doesn't win this lane, because your team is so high range
[1:23:13] Umboday: @icpoet you're basically saying if he messes up you win, that's pretty much true for any match up so what u said is not revolutionary
