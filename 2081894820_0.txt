[0:23:51] 4urkata: @Jackspektra  if u buy eclipse + longsword u get evolve at 7
[0:24:32] twai47: why recall on cannon waves? or is it just a kaisa thing bcs you can always get it with w
[0:24:40] olekron: @4urkata yea, but he buys boots cause he gets q evo anyways on 10
[0:24:42] Kintion: is kaisa op?
[0:24:42] mellowxx97x: Hey
[0:24:44] pepsio: main cons of this build ? eclipse etc ?
[0:24:49] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[0:24:50] ADL1337: @twai47 bcs it tanks tower longer so you don't lose as many minions
[0:24:51] glupperl: wait you can cancel the Q evolve wiht E?????
[0:25:07] glupperl: or is ther no animation?
[0:25:09] olekron: @twai47 takes longer to push for enemys, and longer for tower to clear cannon wave
[0:25:09] ADL1337: and also it takes longer for enemy to push so it gets to tower even later
[0:25:10] mellowxx97x: Do you think kogmaw has any chance to fit in the meta with the new buffs?
[0:25:12] glupperl: there*

[0:25:38] Ariye23: such fan
[0:25:38] mitchxyou: IWILLNOTYIELD
[0:25:42] 4urkata: @olekron ye but if u get evolve 3 levels earlier ur fighting potential is 3 times higher
[0:25:50] ADL1337: you forgot you were playing spectator mode and tried doing something
[0:25:52] ADL1337: oh
[0:26:02] olekron: but he didnt have the money at lvl 7? xd @4urkata

[0:27:39] mams__: bro that eclipse effect looks so cool never paid attention to it
[0:27:46] olekron: @4urkata yea ok, but i would think that its obvious
[0:27:49] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!
[0:27:51] sofus64: gm jack :3
[0:28:39] 3Brick_: @Jackspektra what adc do you recommend if i want to climb and have an easy time learning? (i am plat 3)
[0:30:42] Gastly_lol: @3Brick_ u can climb on literally anything if u put the effort and the time to play games and learn. focus on improving and not winning tho cause u wont start winning 50 games in a row or smth
[0:31:24] geo_1: yoooo beast hows the games going
[0:32:11] Zifi1: @3Brick_ easiest adc probs to climb would be lethality mf
[0:32:20] Marekseuw: or swain
[0:32:23] ADL1337: catJam
[0:32:31] Zifi1: easy to execute, high dmg and 1 ult can win you the game
[0:33:13] olekron: you decide on what to build after eclipse just by what damage type your team needs more?
[0:33:43] Marekseuw: @3Brick_ i'd just spam jinx makes u learn how to play the game properly a lot better than playing cheesy letha mf etc
[0:34:21] theYaBoy710: ashe or sivir to learn adc
[0:34:23] mitchxyou: man ngl for being 0:4 you dont even seem weak @Jackspektra
[0:34:27] theYaBoy710: the most straightforward champs
[0:34:35] ydoxlol: !proview
[0:34:35] Nightbot: if jacks watching a lpl or lck proview its probably from this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@LPLlive/videos
[0:34:36] ADL1337: sivir will make you learn to hate life rn
[0:34:38] Marekseuw: sivir big nono imo
[0:34:44] 3Brick_: thanks for the people helping btw. I am a draven one trick and wanted to expand my champ pool
[0:34:58] Marekseuw: polarizing and uninteractive champion
[0:35:14] theYaBoy710: yeah i hate unlimited wave clear and MS on hit to help kiting and chasing
[0:35:20] theYaBoy710: so bad to learn with
[0:35:20] ADL1337: kek nice one
[0:35:28] Gastly_lol: @3Brick_ draven is insane tho to climb in low elo and very fun
[0:35:33] Arbucks: you just die if you dont have a proper front line on sivir
[0:35:35] flatbun244: could also smash some alibaba components in and call it a day
[0:35:38] flsck: @theYaBoy710 ppl always sleep on ms
[0:35:39] Arbucks: it isnt a good learning experience
[0:35:58] theYaBoy710: thats just adc in general lol
[0:36:01] 3Brick_: if anybody wants my ingame name to give better feedback it is 3Brick#INDIA
[0:36:09] theYaBoy710: dying without a frontline that is
[0:36:18] Arbucks: other adcs actually have range though
[0:36:21] twai47: xerath is such an obnoxious champ
[0:36:39] aloneinthedisco_: but sivir is complete ass atm no? wont be much fun to play
[0:36:40] Marekseuw: think jinx>sivir since sivir is comp dependent and also rly uninteractive so u wont really learn how to lane properly
[0:36:48] Marekseuw: @aloneinthedisco_ also
[0:36:48] maxozabojca99: he held stun for next game lol
[0:37:10] geo_1: is it kaisa senna day today again
[0:37:17] Marekseuw: jinx works in any game which is why id recommend playing it over sivir
[0:37:30] abdozxc12: !ksante

[0:37:39] AitorStrak: is inmortal
[0:37:49] Gastly_lol: @3Brick_ most of ur games are 0-10 bro no offense. focus on dying less especially on draven (ik its hard but u have to) and focus on playing better fights
[0:37:49] 1Nickles: Clueless
[0:37:51] ADL1337: @Marekseuw why not ashe?
[0:37:54] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: these guys arent doing damage

[0:38:41] CossacksLoL: @shmmn_nw Isnt diamond 10 years ago GM or higher?
[0:38:45] vens147: this graves is insisting on setting you behind , taking everything from you
[0:38:54] Marekseuw: and more conscious of the map overall
[0:39:10] ADL1337: @CossacksLoL yeah s8 diamond = s14 gm TRUEEEEE
[0:39:19] Zifi1: ashe would be good to learn mechanics like spacing, kiting etc
[0:39:20] glupperl: Ksante isnt op anymore xDDDD

[2:22:05] gengarenjoyer: draven champ gives losersq i been experiencing the same
[2:22:24] ashuyoxoxo: frozenhearts lows kalista ithink
[2:22:29] lanzi1: whenever I play draven I tend to focus too much on my supp and starts playing terrible
[2:22:31] IcyRickard: Frozen hearth Smile
[2:22:32] sheriff2005: jackspektra on the grind
[2:22:40] ashuyoxoxo: yeah it slows ur champ
[2:23:18] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: mb boss
[2:24:00] lanzi1: how is varus atm?
[2:24:18] ADCPurple: @lanzi1 S+++++
[2:25:03] lanzi1: @ADCPurple sounds like hes alright
[2:25:13] solstario: @adcpurple lethality?
[2:25:18] ADCPurple: anything
[2:25:23] maxsteal9: @lanzi1 ye, somewhat mediocre
[2:25:31] ADCPurple: champ can build anything its always good
[2:25:57] Fumiya_san: do you have your playlist somewhere?
[2:26:27] skylarklul: Yeah the debuff is stupid, should be when you hit a champ they get the debuff, not just perma low AS
[2:27:02] crazyadri1v9: Nerf frozen heart abusers
[2:27:08] maxsteal9: @skylarklul no, it would be dogshit passive than
[2:27:08] crazyadri1v9: yes it does
[2:27:08] ADCPurple: yep
[2:27:08] MrO_2134: they nerf next patch
[2:27:12] ADCPurple: and senna slow too
[2:27:12] TheAvatarofGuroc: Frozen Heart is just too cheap at the moment.  It costs like 2400 gold
[2:27:13] solstario: this game is turbo losable
[2:27:25] skylarklul: @maxsteal9 Like every other passive? xd
[2:27:31] mrfattoadyt: slows slow your dashes
[2:27:33] MrP1ll0w: frozen heart does indeed make your jump slower
[2:27:33] qx1ubo: isnt that the same with ashe volley
[2:27:36] Nikushaa: attack speed = jump speed and ms = distance no?
[2:27:44] MrP1ll0w: its both
[2:27:47] eithlol: it has always been like this
[2:28:03] Nikushaa: fh needs to be removed asap
[2:28:05] TheAvatarofGuroc: Attack speed slows the aa animation, right?
[2:28:14] MokuwuYo: well you have less AS so you aa less, so less jumps
[2:28:20] Onnill_: Why does that stream title make it feel like it's the last stream ever? :)
[2:28:50] ADL1337: @Onnill_ MONKA
[2:28:51] gengarenjoyer: i feel like snowball champs bot r so hard mental wise
[2:28:53] gengarenjoyer: in this season
[2:28:56] ADCPurple: ?????
[2:29:00] mellowxx97x: Wtffff
[2:29:01] muyuu: dash speed scales with attack speed+boots tier, so FH slows your jumps
[2:29:05] ADCPurple: HE IS HIM
[2:29:10] pogankiss: @jackspektra i love how support insects can build frozen heart and counter you completely
[2:29:12] Zifi1: voli is a strong independent man
[2:29:12] MokuwuYo: voli the real god
[2:29:15] skylarklul: @maxsteal9 Doesn't promote healthy gameplay when you can build an item and ruin enemy AD champs by walking around like an ape. Just like any other passive you need to hit them in order for it to work.
[2:29:15] Zifi1: he dont need no team
[2:29:17] solstario: that was like watching the revenant
[2:29:19] atmnfps: i just got called and got good news

[2:31:49] lanzi1: @ADCPurple What do I go in that category
[2:32:09] maxsteal9: @skylarklul ye but its wouldn't work then, for example thornmail gives anti-heal also when cc somebody, but if it would be just reaction item nobody will auto you
[2:32:09] nightmarehost982: frozen hearts would be nice
[2:32:12] ADCPurple: I dont know man i dont know your game lol

[3:57:28] ToneDoLOL: go ghost anyway GIGACHAD
[3:57:51] LinKsTx: yo jack, I have a question, lately most of the games seem unplayable for me as ADC, or they dive between 4 while my support roams and there is no advantage anywhere, or I go 5/0 on the line but on the rival team there is a very fed assassin/magician and I literally can't play without getting a oneshot, what can I do, what should I improve, I even have fun now xD (sorry for the bible)
[3:58:01] LinKsTx: I'm on high emerald/ diamond
[3:58:07] LinKsTx: the games don't have any level is so random
[3:58:16] 365Doors: yea
[3:58:38] Mirezlg: hi
[3:59:17] 1Nickles: WAYTOODANK
[3:59:36] GentleMattman: @LinKsTx the best way to think is to review your games and be brutally honest about your own play. There are always things you can improve upon no matter what your scoreline is. You need to focus on yourself, and ignore your teammates.
[4:00:00] yamigatsu: my goat
[4:00:14] RaFl066: i feel both the eclipse and the LS build are good into squishies but how do you decide between them?
[4:00:24] ToneDoLOL: the build kinda sussy Cooking  tho
[4:00:26] yamigatsu: eclipse shieldbow ingenoius hunter illegal shiledmadien adc build
[4:00:27] GentleMattman: In the end, only you can control your own actions, don't worry about things you can't control, aka your teammates
[4:00:45] zukos1: rank!
[4:00:51] ToneDoLOL: mega weak
[4:00:59] palexhs: LS build is really weak early
[4:01:08] LinKsTx: @gentlemattman yeah probably I'm making a lot of mistakes I'm totally secure
[4:01:11] palexhs: but when you get W upgrade and ludens it slaps
[4:01:13] ToneDoLOL: no kaisa i guess Sadgi
[4:01:17] LinKsTx: but the games have no sense on emerald
[4:01:18] Harmtaro: ls build vomit
[4:01:22] Urepthor: @RaFl066 What is the LS build?
[4:01:23] ShienHersix: hail of blade/lethal?
[4:01:31] palexhs: eclipse probably better in soloq
[4:01:33] lftspace: spektra anytimes on breaking my peak 800 lp i cant really get above it
[4:01:38] lftspace: any tips*
[4:02:06] wulfnine: jack i love your youtube, ur editor is killing it ngl one of my fav ytb channels
[4:02:06] LinKsTx: I think I have a medium/high macro of the game as I watch lot of competitive and people on soloq, is like other game @gentlemattman
[4:02:10] lol_aleo: what do you think about the triple tonic tech when u skip point in ult and max w level 11
[4:02:10] bgjd12: !proview
[4:02:11] Nightbot: if jacks watching a lpl or lck proview its probably from this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@LPLlive/videos
[4:02:17] kennyECS: LS build is good for low elo but in gm/chall, if you come back with tear/cull and enemy comes back with serrated, it's gg
[4:02:26] wulfnine: wulfnine subscribed with Prime. 
[4:02:34] softboialex67: why dont u go taste of blood on secondary ?
[4:02:35] GentleMattman: @LinKsTx I agree Emerald games can be frustrating, believe me. But if I can climb to high diamond, so can you my friend. Just believe in yourself and keep reviewing your games. You will climb eventually.
[4:02:43] lol_aleo: @kennyECS gg ykw

[4:02:59] kennyECS: @lol_aleo what is "ykw"?
[4:03:07] ToneDoLOL: thats gm no?
[4:03:07] Rias_Gremory: Are there any comps you would pick Kog in soloQ? Also enjoy your youtube vidyas
[4:03:08] GentleMattman: @LinKsTx No worries, keep you head held high!
[4:03:09] lol_aleo: you know why
[4:03:09] jinnghost_: @LinKsTx thats why you play jungle
[4:03:09] 1Nickles: @LinKsTx sometimes you have to drop waves and fight, believe me i've been there
[4:03:32] 2Sirious4u: is it fine to mute chat ?
[4:03:36] 2Sirious4u: ingame
[4:03:41] lftspace: thank you very much
[4:03:47] Urepthor: @RaFl066 Oh I don't like to look of that, isn't that just W + passive focussed?
[4:03:51] palexhs: ofc lol text chat is so useless just play with it off
[4:03:53] palexhs: go pings only
[4:03:59] jinnghost_: it's the most punishing thing farming and pushing mid waves while your team takes random jungle fights, think its better to just follow them to climb out of emerald
[4:03:59] kennyECS: what do you mean chat is useless? Phreak told me to type to my karthus to press R
[4:04:13] ToneDoLOL: low masta account gg

[4:04:32] cVlak: your vladimir is opat, do you know him ?
[4:04:41] GentleMattman: Jack do you like going Fleet on Aphelios? I go Fleet because Peyz goes Fleet in most of his games.
[4:04:42] 2Sirious4u: wait does they not see when i ping there R?
[4:04:45] jacksearch: Agree is tilting me so much this change
[4:04:47] kennyECS: you have the "need vision" ping now kek
[4:04:51] qx1ubo: you should be able to hover over someones R to see how long is left
[4:04:53] ShienHersix: yes, cant ping tp on solo lanes sucks
[4:04:57] qx1ubo: people think youre toxic when you want to check
[4:04:58] TheFlamingTiger357: but JACKKK we have a ward ping now :)
[4:05:01] ToneDoLOL: Dearest Karthus,  I hope this finds you well. We seem to have found ourselves in a dire situation at the bottom lane. Please consider casting your ultimate ability to assist us as i do believe Lee sin has come to dive our tower.  Sincerely, Your bottom lane

[4:05:22] yamigatsu: Invite lee to the party then? drinks on me
[4:05:24] MrP1ll0w: eveyone see's the "party chat" pings
[4:05:27] RaFl066: @Urepthor i mean yeah, like it when cant aa cause range diff or an assasin fed but not much interactive so kinda boring
[4:05:32] GentleMattman: @GentleMattman I'm making a Persona 5 calling card with this copypasta

[6:54:42] unwoc: @ascuane oh right
[6:55:00] Chunko: at 400 it would be 12%
[6:55:01] ascuane: just get 4k stacks lol
[6:55:25] unwoc: oh so the true damage nerf is not a big deal
[6:55:27] 2Sirious4u: But smolder nerf its allready low wr
[6:55:44] ascuane: @unwoc i mean ofc it kinda is LUL its kinda one of his main damage abilities
[6:55:57] ascuane: you gotta have damage to get ppl to the threhshold somehow
[6:56:04] Sintemon: i agree
[6:56:09] unwoc: @2Sirious4u low wr because people s*ck at playing him + building wrong items
[6:56:38] unwoc: @ascuane the true dmg is already really small, not doing that much a deal, in my experience
[6:56:42] unwoc: i main smolder rn

[6:58:29] ascuane: @imbastreamer1 it is tho
[6:58:37] Tcyy: These changes kinda make it harder to solo nash and stuff right?
[6:58:40] ascuane: when ever i played wukong i felt like i could get oneshot while engaging everytime

[7:01:01] PolarettoCaliente: slightly nerfed y
[7:01:21] rapheelol: Honestly I think it's more of a buff in low elo
[7:01:26] ToneDoLOL: @Jackspektra do you think the smolder changes are buffs ?
[7:01:30] Faramir1993: never LUL
[7:01:32] rapheelol: Where games tend to get to 35+ mins and supports dont really roam
[7:01:38] gamel_ali2: they need supports stick in lane as possible no >
[7:01:53] antonionr_15: fh is so cheap
