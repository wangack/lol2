[0:39:05] iKelevara: Hey man, these playbacks going over your thought process are really cool. Thanks for doing them. :)
[0:39:07] duck_on_horse: was rell. thanks for carrying me. sorry for dying a lot. tbh we had the wave pushing towards us on those ganks and I kept pinging to just reset. don’t want to make excuses but it’s so hard to play when AD won’t take back timings to dodge ganks with me. so much easier in mid game when I can just play off others.
[0:39:53] duck_on_horse: I should have just left her to die on them and reset alone but that might be trolling samira too lol
[0:40:32] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[0:41:06] songokuorafk: i think that game had a stattik lichbane angle @ChaseShaco
[0:41:30] ZiChaoz: @songokuorafk that is some challenger level thinking
[0:41:49] ZiChaoz: chase isnt good enough to think of the statik lichbane tech
[0:42:11] SailorPluto9: i got an important lesson on roam timers too yesterday and that shit helped me out a ton
[0:42:56] duck_on_horse: yeah I think AD just has a shortage of ppl queuing AD so I keep getting masters ADs lmfao
[0:43:37] duck_on_horse: I think literally every gank, the wave is slow pushing to us so we just had to reset
[0:44:32] shacobako: is this coaching ?
[0:44:34] Guta1ax: Dumb question but what's the difference if Samira is also out of the game? She got outfarmed and lost lane completely
[0:44:55] duck_on_horse: ah I see, alistar had a timer to roam so I wanted to cover
[0:44:55] Nightbot: if only he was Zoe there
[0:45:00] Guta1ax: I mean how could you be sure that game is done that early, why don't they have an opportunity to comeback

[0:46:40] Ixdex1: and i'm a jungle main
[0:46:47] duck_on_horse: I tried to base and roam
[0:46:52] duck_on_horse: But i didnt want samira to die here
[0:47:02] duck_on_horse: hes walking up to try and push the wave to tower but we cant do that

[2:01:30] phelto: do you think sorcery second is better than precision full stop in general or just your preference/good in your elo?
[2:01:47] LlITwitch: i go profane, blade, grudge,tri,deathdance
[2:01:55] Wr4tch: i hate ap shacoo in this season
[2:02:15] SevrinBlaine: Is there another jungler that plays like shaco to play for if someone bans him? I've been wanting to learn him
[2:02:28] DjaySaint: It's good to see AD Shaco viable again. A couple years ago I remember watching you play and having to AP Shaco every game and only AD rarely because AD was just bad for the meta at the time.
[2:02:58] Giegantors: scene
[2:03:05] MozzyGG: Can you share your best shaco urf build?
[2:03:11] MozzyGG: Unironically asking

[2:03:19] LlITwitch: alac

[2:03:37] MozzyGG: @Skyz_Ninjaz DinoDance
[2:04:13] Skyz_Ninjaz: @ChaseShaco you can get haste in URF now, the only wasted stat now is mana
[2:04:27] pottedplant: Is dark star your favorite skin?
[2:04:34] Ningbeck: haste in urf is stil a big diminishing return
[2:04:34] MozzyGG: Ah, I was thinkg the one that gives movespeed on dmg. But it has haste, so maybe not the best then?
[2:04:35] Belock: Mana used to convert to hp does it not anymore?
[2:04:45] phelto: you think profane in its current form is mandatory or skipping tiamat with 2-3 points w is fine?

[2:07:44] Skyz_Ninjaz: wish there was more variety for secondary options
[2:07:49] MozzyGG: I haven't played in a  few years. Is shaco support still good/viable?
[2:08:10] Skyz_Ninjaz: nerfed the max amount of boxes you can have down
[2:08:10] Belock: @MozzyGG Yeah you can play ad shaco support now too.

[2:31:25] OceanBuffalo: @klae20111 bork item pretty helpful
[2:31:27] Skyz_Ninjaz: so he would take a turret shot
[2:31:49] Skyz_Ninjaz: like 11 min i think

[2:34:18] Paul_77: thanks for explanation!
[2:34:26] Skyz_Ninjaz: Pretty sure you die to ult regardless just to ult damage so he just ults both
[2:34:32] chocco_icecream: happens
[2:34:33] ChaseShaco: nah i dont
[2:34:34] SevrinBlaine: Who would you suggest picking  if shaco gets banned?
[2:34:37] klae20111: Did you try adc bulid
[2:34:41] klae20111: Like krakn
[2:34:41] ChaseShaco: the correct play is to r the tornado
[2:34:45] ChaseShaco: but just r doesnt kill me
[2:34:45] chocco_icecream: you cant always assume the enemy have a brain
[2:34:47] ChaseShaco: r q kills

[2:36:57] pottedplant: What's your favorite shaco skin
[2:37:03] Skyz_Ninjaz: Would the outcome have been the same if you leaned more toward ulting late rather than early? Like buffering the nado?
[2:37:48] tkoschuster22: !runes
[2:37:48] Nightbot: When building AP go DH, when building AD go HOB, for hybrid build go whatever you prefer, for support go comet
[2:38:01] Skyz_Ninjaz: yes, if you ult later you would dodge it but I mean like if you went too late
[2:38:11] ChaseShaco: if i went to late i cant ult at all
[2:38:14] ChaseShaco: because im knocked up
[2:38:22] ChaseShaco: i was ontop of him so it wasnt that easy

[2:38:43] ChaseShaco: i wanted nado to hit clone on backside
[2:39:50] Skyz_Ninjaz: he also did the animation cancel with his W+Q
[2:40:07] ChaseShaco: it makes no difference
[2:40:09] OceanBuffalo: @ChaseShaco No. 100

[2:41:40] IHer0I: didn’t think about that, that would be a nice combo
[2:41:51] Skyz_Ninjaz: Ori shaco best combo
[2:41:59] IHer0I: ori ball on shaco would go hard
[2:42:06] shacotale: yea
[2:42:08] Skyz_Ninjaz: Shaco Shen nice too but shen is shit rn
[2:42:08] Nightbot: is an anagram for chaos
[2:42:21] shacotale: but i d say best ori combo is with malph
[2:43:06] OceanBuffalo: think grag supp
[2:43:24] Skyz_Ninjaz: what makes shaco ori so good is you dont see it coming. Malph ori is pretty telegraphed unless from out of vision
[2:43:42] DefinitelyTomato: What do you think about lich bane ap shaco? Is there a potential for big q dmg?
[2:43:43] IHer0I: that makes sense
[2:43:53] Skyz_Ninjaz: if you have vision on both and ori puts ball on malph you should probably run like hell LMAO
