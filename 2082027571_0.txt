[0:28:55] astrolojikpunk: I honestly think that riot should  only allow certain picks in ranked like only Jax, Aatrox, Ornn etc but not Jayce and VAyne
[0:29:36] tonicigareta: and the problem is that the ranged champs still get like 3k hp
[0:29:54] trashboatxtd: i think s8 was the best meta for carry tops

[1:52:05] TheJunkyardWolf: @YeaYeaByeBye Akshan is the only ranged top that doesnt bother me when i see him.
[1:52:06] chrono_ward: Top lane is Midlane 2.0 at this point
[1:52:08] t1r4nno: he is fun af tho, but the minirw he got ruined his balance
[1:52:10] Anfraak: fired rioter
[1:52:16] Nicholai_Deus: will Wukong's buff make him S tier?
[1:52:17] last_hakira: goodn't
[1:52:19] danypose10: that zyra carry
[1:52:20] alpha_poggers123: top diff
[1:52:30] hipper98: its fundamentally wrong
[1:52:30] qduke: is jhin the most balanced champ in league history ?
[1:52:44] firetex_live: @Naayil What matchup do you enjoy most as Aatrox?
[1:52:45] smooooooth_operator: same situation with zeri
[1:52:46] angelo_g1: ksante has more reworks than ryze
[1:52:48] Addic73d_god: @TheJunkyardWolf the only issue with him is the stealth with full team res. but the kit is fine
[1:52:50] RedonicRedfire: pro play difference lol
[1:52:57] sixthyyy: !rank
[1:53:04] eyeabovel: lol
[1:53:07] RedonicRedfire: one is played frequently in pro play, one isn't played at all
[1:53:08] angelo_g1: that is support gap in my eyes
[1:53:09] OskarG88: supports are weak Clueless
[1:53:20] qduke: which champ has been the most balanced in the history of league ?
[1:53:22] hasan7v7: Naayil im heading to chemistry class rn any tips
[1:53:25] swisslion2806: @qduke probably not hes probably just one of the weakest league champs in history cuz i mean i dont remember when jhin was op or meta
[1:53:25] TheJunkyardWolf: @Addic73d_god Yeah, that's kinda op in higher elo.
[1:53:27] filips322: Spirit better into a fed zyra than maw, no?
[1:53:44] swisslion2806: nah they just dont know what to do with him
[1:53:58] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil

[1:54:16] Kermitanx: !rank
[1:54:18] N1CKEUW: Yh its true, he was very op but also very tailored to elite elo/pro play and not easy for lower elo. Now he is easier to play but also still op
[1:54:18] Confident_af: what did they rework about k'sate?
[1:54:18] qduke: zeri also cant be balanced
[1:54:20] kholat17: which is more cancer in top lanephase though, quinn or tf?
[1:54:28] Confident_af: what did they rework about k'sante?
[1:54:30] TheJunkyardWolf: I mained him as soon as he was released and people complained he was shit just because they didnt know how to play him. After 2 months he was "broken"
[1:54:33] nonstopnonsense1: yes

[1:55:25] soul_bolt: Riot doesnt wanna balance, cause then with Time the game would get stale. Look at Apex Legends

[3:49:44] angrybirds5: Has Naayil lost any cannon in this match?
[3:49:46] pidgeon35: @aul3q he doesnt like it
[3:50:29] KamusLoL: NAYIL read patch notes already?
[3:50:33] bardzaya: @Naayil can you show varus' name?
[3:50:40] Noelletrox: @pidgeon35 because if u build lethality u die of oneshot and if u buy this u have sustain and almost the same damage
[3:51:24] danypose10: Do u see league tiktoks? i mean the off account wtf
[3:51:42] Squizik_: @Noelletrox nah not even near the same dmg but sustain is nice yeah

[3:54:13] GRAAV1LOHI: @z3urnwi tbh from what i have tried i feel like eclipse rush is worse if ur not fed than sundered sky
[3:54:23] zDusk: @blameriot221 extra healing and shielding from ivern
[3:54:27] sssubsonic: 3 point ult big diff?
[3:54:36] Squizik_: @z3urnwi sure but going profane -> edge -> seryldas is so much damage you cant compare bruiser items to it, since these 3 items barely give any health only dmg mostly, still bruiser aatrox is more consistent tho
[3:55:20] sadkatto: HUH

[3:55:59] tralpay: !cannon

[3:56:06] M4GnZ: @blank091099 eclipse aatrox first item is very nice
[3:56:17] Squizik_: wait smolder actually managed to scale to 225 LETSGO

[4:43:27] astrolojikpunk: Aatrox is a bruiser spellcaster all of his abilities except r are skillshot but not long or close range his aa is also melee so hes closer to a bruiser imo

[5:11:51] maxwelldummy: MAKE AATROX Q3 TRUE DAMAGE
[5:12:01] pidgeon35: wouldnt be that bad even i think
[5:12:07] Yourjaps: Every other top laner empowered auto procs on turrets why not Aatrox
[5:12:26] ItzKazumaSama: replace W with some good ability that works on towers
[5:12:30] Yourjaps: Even Ekko E procs on turret lmao
[5:12:32] Joses147: how are you doing today naayil ALOO
[5:12:32] armadros: what if fiora passive proced on turrets
[5:12:36] pidgeon35: nah just revert the w nerf
[5:12:44] SchmitzV2: why aatrox holding a giant banana
[5:12:44] maxwelldummy: they need to rework w like the faster you are, the slower you become or smth
[5:13:02] t1r4nno: @Yourjaps because it isn't a empowered auto, only a  enhanced auto

[5:16:44] Yourjaps: @t1r4nno @t1r4nno mf passive?
[5:16:56] Vexdestroyer22: @stochasticlife700 tbf nasus needs a rework and has been in a bad state for years
[5:16:57] S4nakl: hp% true dmg
[5:17:00] femaledante: Fiora players will tell you she is hard XD
[5:17:14] maxwelldummy: im telling you
[5:17:21] maxwelldummy: even mordekaiser is harder to play than fiora
[5:17:23] alcheraxx_: whats the most broken champ in the current meta ?
[5:17:25] t1r4nno: @Yourjaps damn u got me there
[5:17:29] pidgeon35: @maxwelldummy nah too far XD
[5:17:44] deicideqc: @Vexdestroyer22 i quite enjoy nasus but it's true that you feel your limitation in alot of game
[5:17:57] lala621: gg
[5:17:59] maxwelldummy: @pidgeon35 18 level fiora vs 18 level mordekaiser
[5:18:02] maxwelldummy: who is scarier
[5:18:08] stochasticlife700: check who was ghosting
[5:18:09] hylo_pll: congrats riot good champ
[5:18:09] Yourjaps: @t1r4nno @t1r4nno yeah, Diana and Yi passive also work, tf E too
[5:18:13] pidgeon35: ye she is scarier but morde is braindead af
[5:18:22] AlmogMa: it was potent u know
[5:18:33] maxwelldummy: since it is braindead there is literally no mobility or whatsoever
[5:18:43] maxwelldummy: you make a mistake you literally get shit on
[5:18:50] OohWanda: some music?
[5:18:58] Omrilavy200: don’t think ghosting is reportable

[5:19:09] angelo_g1: isn't that like most top laners? you make a mistake your lane is fucked
[5:19:28] Omrilavy200: banned plays don’t buy skins tho
[5:19:33] Omrilavy200: players*
[5:19:35] Vexdestroyer22: @deicideqc not saying he's not fun to play i play him too but all he is, is a stat checker with a slow and armor shred aoe he need more of a modern kit to be playable in higher elo
[5:19:40] mohamadlefteye: even riot approves fiora is easy, her skill ceiling is 1 line and aatrox has 2
[5:19:41] aaleris: how many lp for chall
[5:19:45] Pyrotoxinss: naayil so sexy man
[5:19:54] RedonicRedfire: camille knows if somebody is in the vicinity of she latches to a wall, vision or no vision
[5:20:00] OohWanda: some music?
[5:20:04] pidgeon35: ivern pog
[5:20:09] Yourjaps: I believe ghosting isnt bannable cause it's not actually against twitch or league ToS, even if it was how do they prove it
[5:20:10] BlackCarrpet: Who wins the jax vs fiora matchup?
[5:20:21] maxwelldummy: league loses
[5:20:25] thegodofparmesan: GP can also be a fake skull champ when he’s strong enough to just Q on cooldown and win fights like that with corruption foots
[5:20:31] Clayn____: !rank
[5:20:33] pidgeon35: senna is giga aids
[5:20:35] thegodofparmesan: pots*
[5:20:40] yaymesVAL: @BlackCarrpet it's a skill matchup but easier to play as jax (i jax main)
[5:20:41] pidgeon35: broken since start of the season
[5:20:53] pidgeon35: kinda ye
[5:21:02] OohWanda: some music?
[5:21:04] aaleris: how many lp for challenger?
[5:21:10] pidgeon35: just need basic spacing and kiting and ur good
[5:21:21] OohWanda: @aaleris he is chall, i think
[5:21:27] nearosdreamer02: Wise mystical tree
[5:21:29] i_artoria_i: True
[5:21:29] Tongks: W with Grounded effect should happen now
[5:21:30] pidgeon35: agree honestly
[5:21:36] deicideqc: @Vexdestroyer22 i feel like just changing his e and adding an extra effect on his w would be enough
[5:21:39] Sakatachi1: Hey boss, what headset ru using?
[5:21:45] alcheraxx_: @Naayil which one is worse MU for aa  ire fio or rumble?
[5:21:53] maxwelldummy: i need to play another champ in top lane other than aatrox man when it gets banned or picked
[5:21:54] Yoshiiyuki: @OohWanda gm, you can see it top left
[5:21:56] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/

[5:22:23] thedoryboy: how strong do you think trynd is rn?
[5:22:25] OohWanda: @Yoshiiyuki yeah ik, but i think that that doesnt load, how much is chall?
[5:22:33] mohamadlefteye: fatsack gragas ur fine bro
[5:22:40] alcheraxx_: it could be the same au
[5:22:48] Vexdestroyer22: fiora should need to aim her q to proc her passive imo. like most of her kit is auto aim
[5:22:51] Lucix74: dont you think aatrox needs more mobility?
[5:22:56] 1DavyJones_: go blood moon
[5:22:59] maxwelldummy: @pidgeon35 thats what im trying to pick up but its so easy to kite and have no mobility idk maybe ksante or yone idk really
[5:23:04] yaymesVAL: @thedoryboy weak imo
[5:23:09] DigitalEdwin: because it costs mana /s
[5:23:20] OohWanda: is that a vape NotLikeThis
[5:23:22] maxwelldummy: have you seen any gangplanks lately naayil?
[5:23:23] Yourjaps: Not that I agree with it but I think riots logic is that E Q combo on Aatrox is too strong and no mana cost on top of it
[5:23:37] thedoryboy: @yaymesVAL i feel the same rn trynd feels terrible rn
[5:23:44] Yoshiiyuki: @OohWanda think its like 815 or something
[5:23:44] pidgeon35: i havent seen one gankplank in my games whole season
[5:23:47] Green_Shooter: we need same on Aatrox, if dash toward enemy  lower cd on E @Naayil

[5:25:13] mohamadlefteye: @maxwelldummy brazilian?
[5:25:14] yaymesVAL: @deicideqc i think items aren't good for him rn and lethal tempo just got nerfed

[5:31:14] Vexdestroyer22: @theamazingalmitysalmon akali trade patterns are a bit similar to aatrox but if your used to the mobilty akali has it might take awhile to get used to aatrox lack of it but it should be easy to try

[6:20:22] cheerios20203: @Bromatick won't affect her much and if they buff her again she goes straight back to toplane
[6:20:22] togglefall: first time chatter here! what’s your favourite ? thanks !
[6:20:35] cheerios20203: @Bromatick It's impossible to balance vayne and not make her top with her kit
