[3:38:22] Halofan642: zyra range is insane
[3:38:25] Halofan642: she has like 1200 range or something
[3:38:42] Halofan642: he should max q>w>e tho, or do 3 points q into w max
[3:38:48] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 higher
[3:38:58] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 no max Q last
[3:39:02] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity LMFAO actually?
[3:39:09] Halofan642: nah def max q first
[3:39:11] pureiinsanity: ofc
[3:39:24] Halofan642: wr is higher on q>w>e but also it just makes more sense
[3:39:24] pureiinsanity: even nidhog maxes Q last i think
[3:39:40] Halofan642: in his vid i saw he went 3 points q into w e
[3:40:10] pureiinsanity: you dont need Q to clear and E increases CC duration
[3:40:17] pureiinsanity: i personally hate maxing Q
[3:40:21] Halofan642: cc duration is fake
[3:40:26] pureiinsanity: it makes sense mid but this is not mid
[3:40:35] pureiinsanity: is it tho?
[3:40:46] pureiinsanity: i say Q dmg is fake
[3:40:46] Halofan642: ya mid/bot its non-negotiable imo
[3:40:57] pureiinsanity: u use it to spawn plants not for dmg
[3:41:04] neptunesxdl: did u know that lich bane passive when the sheen is procced will give 50% attack speed
[3:41:11] Halofan642: i mean ya imo going from 7 > 5 seconds vs 1 to 2 sec duration isnt that useful
[3:41:21] pureiinsanity: @neptunesxdl yes
[3:41:24] Halofan642: i do like nidhoggs 3 points q into w max tho i think that makes sense too
[3:41:50] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:41:59] pureiinsanity: does 3 Q matter for faster clear tho?
[3:42:08] pureiinsanity: you already clear so fast i dont think it matters
[3:42:37] pureiinsanity: you just kinda make things pop
[3:42:52] neptunesxdl: ik the person whi invtented zyrungle :3
[3:42:52] Halofan642: idk i spam q > w so it seems nice to be able to q > w an extra second vs .5 sec cc duration
[3:43:01] Halofan642: i would need to review multiple games tho
[3:43:03] neptunesxdl: insanely broken ;-;
[3:43:19] Halofan642: in order to see if its just a feeling thing rather than actually useful
[3:43:34] pureiinsanity: https://clips.twitch.tv/KitschyArtisticBeaverPanicBasket-giIYlKDum5__Mnqi
[3:43:45] pureiinsanity: im not sure
[3:44:04] Halofan642: @5up crpytbloom bro? ability hatse is imo on this champ
[3:44:05] pureiinsanity: i've played a lot of zyra in Arena and there you always max E > W > Q
[3:44:21] neptunesxdl: 5up do u have any others songs like c u by benee? i got the song from u but never found anything similar afterwards :sob:
[3:44:40] Halofan642: ya i mostly lpayed zyra apc  tbf
[3:44:58] pureiinsanity: on APC Q max makes sense
[3:45:01] pureiinsanity: to clear minions
[3:45:30] Halofan642: zyra is one of my fav champs in league she plays like no other champion in this game
[3:45:53] pureiinsanity: yes i agree
[3:46:03] pureiinsanity: whenever i wanted to win in Arena i whip out zyra
[3:46:18] pureiinsanity: disgusting when properly played
[3:46:23] Halofan642: zyra has like 1400 range
[3:46:33] pureiinsanity: yeah
[3:46:38] pureiinsanity: shes Xerath but you can't miss
[3:46:40] Halofan642: and she gets to zone like no other hcamp does
[3:46:57] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:47:00] Halofan642: i mean she also provides waymore zone control
[3:47:04] Halofan642: i guess xerath has w/e
[3:47:09] THE_Bacon90: o_0 they throwing
[3:47:11] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 heimer also gets to zone
[3:47:37] Halofan642: yeah but zyras seems easier and more effective
[3:47:43] Halofan642: ive never played heimer tho
[3:47:45] pureiinsanity: i have mained heimer for a long time and they are somewhat simular
[3:47:51] Halofan642: but like throwing a couple seeds down they cant walk into any chokepoint
[3:48:20] pureiinsanity: zyra is better because she has more range
[3:48:25] pureiinsanity: at least atm
[3:48:37] Halofan642: ya 1400 range is crazy
[3:48:50] Absolunacy: uh oh
[3:48:57] THE_Bacon90: oy vei
[3:48:58] balletbunny: thats crazy
[3:48:59] Absolunacy: this game is quickly going down a bad path
[3:49:10] pureiinsanity: heimer has way higher DPS but 1 MR item and it doesn't matter
[3:49:33] Halofan642: ya heimer also seems like he has to hit other abilities to be useful
[3:49:34] pureiinsanity: so easy to get countered this season
[3:49:40] Halofan642: on zyra i just spam q>w
[3:49:54] pureiinsanity: ^ thats why i dont max Q
[3:50:00] pureiinsanity: just used for plant spawning
[3:51:59] cari141: Hello 5upWave
[3:52:01] pureiinsanity: yea sadly mages in this season VS tanks
[3:52:03] pureiinsanity: is so sad
[3:52:06] Halofan642: ya and the numbers work out so the extra 2 seconds doesnt mean another q cause ur still waiting for w to respawn
[3:52:07] Nightbot: 5upL
[3:52:09] Halofan642: ill try e max ye
[3:52:20] B00PdeB00P: hows the climb goin?
[3:52:44] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 well not if you play her APC
[3:52:46] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity did he baron at 20 min ?
[3:52:54] pureiinsanity: you need the waveclear from Q there
[3:52:55] Halofan642: or is this first zyra jg game
[3:53:04] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity i play her apc mid supp jg in that order
[3:53:06] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 uhh i was not paying attention
[3:53:11] pureiinsanity: we were too distracted
[3:53:11] Halofan642: mostly cause i havent played jg in awhile, or else itd be apc jg mid supp
[3:53:27] Halofan642: ive not played zyra top yet but im like pretty sure its viable
[3:53:52] pureiinsanity: yeah Zyra is viable every role
[3:53:55] pureiinsanity: probably worst top tho cuz
[3:53:57] B00PdeB00P: Ingenious hunter
[3:54:02] B00PdeB00P: and cosmic
[3:54:04] pureiinsanity: any MR item and kiss goodbye to your dmg
[3:54:16] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 threasure
[3:54:35] pureiinsanity: E max on Support is also prob best
[3:54:37] MariiWotterii: akshan solo lost the game

[3:59:19] Halofan642: Sadge i meant unconditonal poke
[3:59:29] Halofan642: jhin w isnt a real ability besides for sniping cannons and cc
[3:59:40] Halofan642: also gp r
[3:59:51] pureiinsanity: Hwei QW
[4:00:03] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:00:07] Drude27: surprised no one mentioned Varus
[4:00:15] pureiinsanity: ANY % Kog R speedrun
[4:00:25] coolwaveofcalm: Caitlyn?
[4:00:35] Halofan642: OK ALL OF THESE ARE CONDITIONAL
[4:00:47] Halofan642: IF UR CAITLYN R'ING FOR POKE U CAN ONLY DO IT EVERY 60 SECONDS OR WHATEVER
[4:00:53] Halofan642: U CAN MISS HWEI QW
[4:00:57] Halofan642: YOU CANNOT MISS ZYRA PLANT .
[4:00:58] Drude27: how is varus conditional
[4:01:11] Halofan642: u can miss it
[4:01:18] Halofan642: nah it doesnt tickle
[4:01:22] pureiinsanity: Zyra literally needs 2 spells to poke 1400 range
[4:01:26] pureiinsanity: thats also conditional
[4:01:44] Nightbot: 5upL
[4:01:47] Halofan642: her passive is a damage spell, no?
[4:02:22] dono_htx: neeko has been pretty broken lately
[4:02:28] pureiinsanity: using the term "unconditional" so deceiving
[4:02:38] pureiinsanity: Neeko can't poke as well
[4:03:18] Halofan642: doesnt neeko have a interaction with comet
[4:03:23] pureiinsanity: her poke is 1k range
[4:03:26] Halofan642: where comet is near unmissable or else u get hit by q2 and then thats not good
[4:03:27] dono_htx: and her ult is insane
[4:03:44] Halofan642: but after 1 item neeko doesnt poke she just engages with r
[4:04:30] pureiinsanity: the Reason why Zyra mid is not that great
[4:04:38] pureiinsanity: you dont have Zakzak or Scorchclaw
[4:04:40] pureiinsanity: so its saj
[4:04:53] Halofan642: with zyra u can qw every 5 seconds and it applies all ur runes and items, liandrys comet scorch rylais
[4:04:55] pureiinsanity: you lose 1 of your poke amplifiers
[4:05:56] Skrunken: W no longer the way to go?
[4:06:34] Halofan642: did u just gain 40 from fleet  ... ?
[4:06:54] Nightbot: 5upL
[4:07:01] pureiinsanity: 47 lol
[4:07:16] briweb11: ok I left for a bit how have games been
[4:07:30] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity ye he leveled
[4:08:05] pureiinsanity: im pretty sure sup and JNG zyra have to be better
[4:08:11] pureiinsanity: cuz scorchclaw and Zakzak
[4:08:34] pureiinsanity: such a big deal having one of those at least
[4:08:36] Halofan642: ya but they can be overtuned in those roles and still be good mid :)
[4:08:46] Taggletoast: excuse me waiter theres a janna in my top side
[4:08:51] Halofan642: ya idk why zakzak has 4% on it so stupid LOL
[4:09:09] pureiinsanity: and 20% ap ratio for some reason
[4:09:11] pureiinsanity: fair
[4:09:37] 9fierce9: Looking like ARAM
[4:09:50] pureiinsanity: meanwhile scorchclaw does 4% true damage
[4:10:25] 9fierce9: This Janna is so strange
[4:11:08] afiuh: afiuh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 5upL 5upL
[4:11:15] pureiinsanity: 4% max health true damage
[4:11:20] Skrunken: i saw alot of people building smolder tanky last week, but i dont know what exactly
[4:11:54] Nightbot: 5upL
[4:12:14] 9fierce9: Tham getting slept there was funny peepoGiggles
[4:12:35] Halofan642: its probably bot lane vs mid if i had to guess
[4:12:56] Halofan642: nah nobody ever gets more stacks bot from waht ive seen
[4:13:36] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 im trying to convince 5up of this Senna duo tech with soraka where you run Spirit visage into Hurricane
[4:13:52] Halofan642: thats evil villain tech
[4:13:59] pureiinsanity: you dont want enemies to die so you minmax stacks
[4:14:02] Halofan642: do you take PoM?
[4:14:05] 9fierce9: Yall want to watch 5up plummet
[4:14:17] pureiinsanity: uhh im not sure
[4:14:19] Halofan642: no i meant for his senna tech
[4:14:35] Halofan642: ye sry
[4:14:47] pureiinsanity: POM is so good but so is Overheal on that pick
[4:14:48] Halofan642: PoM on smolder would be only good pre first/second back imo and at that point just manage mana better idk
[4:14:52] pureiinsanity: so its hard
[4:15:07] Halofan642: ya i guess u just cant q on senna a lot with that pick
[4:15:10] Halofan642: cause ur gonna go oom fast af
[4:15:23] Halofan642: or maybe u just dont need it with soraka/fleet
[4:15:29] pureiinsanity: yeah
[4:15:35] pureiinsanity: oh
[4:15:37] pureiinsanity: i run LT
[4:15:46] pureiinsanity: fleet is not useful when you have soraka
[4:16:06] pureiinsanity: even tho LT has less value on her
[4:16:28] pureiinsanity: im like half thinking if Grasp might be best tho
[4:16:33] RedLettuced: RedLettuced subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! What did I miss
[4:16:48] Nightbot: 5upL
[4:16:53] pureiinsanity: cuz both Soraka and Senna run Revitalize
[4:16:59] pureiinsanity: for stacking
[4:17:05] solpiperita: !quote

[4:17:13] Squeeezus_: Good afternoon 5up and chat gang
[4:17:20] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 its sometimes better to Q Soraka instead of enemies

[4:17:40] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity oh that makes snse yeah
[4:17:40] Squeeezus_: where were you previously?
[4:18:16] pureiinsanity: Hurricane on Senna is insane
[4:18:27] Squeeezus_: @zinzanish
[4:18:31] Squeeezus_: gwdSuavemente gwdSuavemente gwdSuavemente gwdSuavemente gwdSuavemente gwdSuavemente
[4:18:36] pureiinsanity: the biggest problem with it is you need to be tanky enough to get in range of people
[4:18:42] pureiinsanity: and a build like that allows it
[4:19:15] Squeeezus_: oh are you doing the sojin build now instead of QB?
[4:19:16] pureiinsanity: Hurricane procs Senna on hit, marks people for souls, Steals souls, Resets Q CD, does %health on hit
[4:19:21] pureiinsanity: it does SO SO SO much
[4:19:32] neonpaintedpigeons: Mmmm strings beloved
[4:19:37] pureiinsanity: just from Senna's passive alone
[4:19:39] Halofan642: ye i know about the hurricane tech
[4:20:03] pureiinsanity: and then you'd go for something like Shieldbow 3rd
[4:20:16] pureiinsanity: sometimes shieldbow first if into Double Physical lane
[4:20:18] Halofan642: resetting q cd is pretty fun interaction tbh
[4:20:22] pureiinsanity: where MR not good
[4:20:51] pureiinsanity: but yeah you basically become tankier than a tank and Farm for shit tons of stacks
[4:21:35] pureiinsanity: after that you are forced to build Damage tho cuz otherwise they will focus Soraka

[6:13:16] pureiinsanity: costed you that kill
[6:13:22] Halofan642: @5up btw your plants spawn weird, you can spawn plants AFTER the q does dmg
[6:13:34] Halofan642: i would try it in practice tool after, but you can get some extra range that way
[6:13:46] pureiinsanity: ^
[6:13:52] pureiinsanity: DW halo he wont read that

[6:15:55] Halofan642: and the plant auto ofc
[6:16:08] SylHoliday: geez

[6:19:09] pureiinsanity: in this play you have to use your W after your E has already done its animation so you don't spawn wrong plants

[6:38:50] neonpaintedpigeons: I'm too scared to watch the ghibli movies I haven't watched
[6:39:09] Fr4gp4rty: @neonpaintedpigeons why?
[6:39:28] Fr4gp4rty: Which ones have you watched already?
[6:39:43] neonpaintedpigeons: Theyre too special to just watch 5upCry
[6:39:46] neonpaintedpigeons: HDKSHDKS
[6:40:00] Tirmel: The movies are so hyped that sometimes they can't live up to expectations
[6:40:21] lavfully: @neonpaintedpigeons i’m like “what if i don’t like them” that’s sacrilege
[6:41:00] Fr4gp4rty: Ive watched almost all of them and they were all solid movies
[6:41:09] Tirmel: I mean....
[6:41:19] Kurogane22773: Is master Yi talking about jax?

[6:42:13] Tirmel: I saw Kiki's Delivery Service and Arrietty
[6:42:23] Tirmel: The writing
[6:42:27] AkitaAttribute: Good news is that they don't have the annoying tropes as a bunch of other anime
[6:42:43] Shamuuu7: Spirited away is my favorite

[6:43:28] angelarson: !rank
[6:43:29] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond IV 0 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[6:43:32] Shamuuu7: Spirited away and Totoro are my top, mostly because when I was little Totoro was my shit
[6:43:33] neonpaintedpigeons: Princess mononoke isn't in your top?
[6:43:37] Fr4gp4rty: Princess mononoke and grave of the fireflies are good movies aswell
[6:43:40] AkitaAttribute: This game winnable af

[6:44:36] Shamuuu7: Half the class was crying
[6:44:45] Tirmel: Oh gosh that sounds so sad
[6:44:47] neonpaintedpigeons: reminds me of 1000 paper cranes book
[6:44:55] TwinDissonance: it was the firebombings more than the nuke
[6:45:02] AkitaAttribute: Saga of Tanya the evil flashed before my eyes
[6:45:46] Fr4gp4rty: Yeah, it is sad but still worth a watch. Like "in this corner of the world"
[6:46:12] neonpaintedpigeons: Okokok
[6:46:38] Tirmel: Dubbed or Subbed for Spirited Away?
[6:46:56] Nightbot: 5upL
[6:47:17] Tirmel: Noted
[6:47:21] Shamuuu7: I grew up with dubbed
[6:48:10] Tirmel: 5upLUL I figured, but there are so shows where the dub/sub are completely different vibes
[6:48:16] Shamuuu7: But I grew up watching both dubbed and subbed of Totoro because we had a family who we became friends with who were from Japan. Sadly they had to go back because of the tsunami
[6:49:34] canisgenus: Dubbed for studio ghibli is really good, I usually prefer subbed for everything but studio ghibli both are really good
[6:49:51] Fr4gp4rty: Have any of you watched ame and yuki(not a ghibli movie)?
