[1:06:29] Umbracious: @YGbabyToadx if youre struggling with the matchup go dorans shield, but you dont NEED it in any matchup, it just makes some matchups easier
[1:06:31] YGbabyToadx: mostly ranged champs btw

[1:07:51] Umbracious: @YGbabyToadx im saying that applies to you, someone else might be better at range matchups and not need dorans shield
[1:07:55] YGbabyToadx: @Umbracious if your not taking blade all the time as riven you shouldnt be playing riven. only against shield
[1:08:03] YGbabyToadx: and ranged
