[2:51:06] Inerio: @xemnas3717 It depends on your specific requirements, the first approach with a Node struct inside the LinkedList class is often sufficient and easier to work with. However, if you anticipate needing more complex node operations or want a more modular design, the second approach with a separate Node class might be preferable

[3:33:48] pantheram: What do you think GP needs to be pro viable again? I feel like early barrel CD nerfs would be a healthy buff for him, so you actually have a little bit of error leeway in lane without going 0/10 immediately
[3:33:52] hideonSR: @eg_bloody yea
[3:34:36] simonwutface: @solarbacca  fiora is a  challanger toplaner, he is not famus on twitch but do u belive he deserve challanger?
