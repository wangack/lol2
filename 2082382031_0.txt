[1:41:32] brady_crazy0: Yo bro why do people make such a huge fuss about age in esports? Casters especially. For example a 29 year old reaction time difference is negligible compared to an 18 year old. And it's not like he's dumber either so what's the issue? Plus reaction time ain't even as much of a deal compared to a game like an fps... there are baseball players with insane reaction times in their 40s

[2:28:04] bdpetee: @AntcliffLIVE yeah no one wants to take 5 days to level an account
[2:28:05] rmsprowler: hopefully you didn't spend money on skins on that account that got banned.
[2:28:19] Darkstorm5951: COPIUM one day they will add ranks per position so you don't need multiple accounts to play different positions
[2:28:30] itz_kevun: diamond account in challenger games hahaha
[2:28:38] iDr3am1: @AntcliffLIVE because riot employees own account buying sites and they make bank off of ppl buying botted accounts and then them banning them after a few weeks, so ppl will do it over and over again
[2:28:39] AntcliffLIVE: @bdpetee 5 days of 8 hour mind numbing afk bot games

[2:37:46] browy_eu: “we can never kill him”: proceeds to kill wukong
[2:37:50] Chrisssan: your're rank1 guy. D1 guys want to get to masters. Chally guys are already full of themselves
[2:38:33] moesahen98: 30 mins queues into an inting top laner makes my day
[2:39:49] cahallo: I feel like only master players really just play to keep their rank, challys like lp too much, unless it's a decay game in which case the rank doesn't matter they will play awfully (it even happened in diamond before they increased the time it takes to decay)
[2:40:08] Darkstorm5951: Is cull for Lucian top still the play or not anymore?
[2:40:13] xfreefer: mostly how many games you play after a certain point
[2:40:13] moesahen98: i stop climbing after getting m1 .. play for decay only
[2:40:34] Chrisssan: FAT SHUTDOWN
[2:40:36] AntcliffLIVE: @cahallo the jump in skill level from masters to gm 400lp is quite large. then the jump in skill from 400lp to 1300lp is waaaay bigger
[2:40:45] Darkstorm5951: KEKW

[2:41:01] smackaveliiii: NOT HIS NUTS KEKL
[2:41:03] moesahen98: @AntcliffLIVE in terms of what? I think its macro only
[2:41:06] cahallo: @RexMundiDeus darius
[2:41:20] AntcliffLIVE: @RexMundiDeus his Q does more damage if it hits just you so if you cant dodge it at least stand in your wave so it wont do as much dmg
[2:41:28] xfreefer: oof
[2:41:33] astro___wolf: @RexMundiDeus olaf is he hardest counter
[2:41:35] zackk_lol: @RexMundiDeus just dodge his Q's and avoid long trades lol
[2:41:44] astro___wolf: but u need to know when u win as olaf
[2:41:56] Chrisssan: at least they dont have 5 grubs
[2:42:00] AntcliffLIVE: @moesahen98 macro, micro, mental. the biggest thing i notice is teamfighting. 1k+ lp players generally have a much better understanding of team comps and how to fight instead of just a masters fiesta
