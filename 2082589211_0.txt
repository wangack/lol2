[4:08:30] petejones_1: AINTNOWAY
[4:08:32] rettybol: hiya @Wingsofdeath lore reader  here, jax is a sand troll wielding the quarterstaff named last light of icathia, jax's race is a cousin of trundle from frejord the same place gragas and in said region an everage troll can probly carry up to 2 ton (trundle being the strongest) so if you're hitting someone with an embued staff with a force of nearly 2 ton behind it, i think the staff might hurt abit more
[4:08:40] PlayLoose: 1 cubic meter of wine is heavier than 1 cubic meter of water Kappa
[4:08:56] friendlycrackdealer: Science, numbers? DansGame
[4:08:59] gruen69: logic hard, wine light kekw
[4:08:59] feetofdeath: you guys dont count how much he drunk already tho Keepo
[4:09:13] petejones_1: how much you think his donger weighs?
[4:09:25] iufoz: did veigar jsut do a ring around the rosie
[4:09:29] friendlycrackdealer: Yeah, we're assuming the barrel is full of wine but it could be almost empty. Kappa

[4:10:19] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath also just a notable feat from jax lore, he killed an ascended, demi gods of ancient shurima, nasus/renekton/azir these guys can in lore melt the flesh from your bone just by a wave of hand
[4:10:36] friendlycrackdealer: It might not make a difference, but I'd rather get hit with a barrel than hit with an anchor. Either way I'm probably dead maybe.
[4:10:46] feetofdeath: sylas almost full items before 20 xdd666

[4:11:08] CranKextreme: jax was a ninja turtle
[4:11:14] IronFuneral: exactly. and he could beat everyone using a chicken leg
[4:11:47] feetofdeath: best lore was yi 15 yold got mad at his parents and went to the woods to chop trees with a sword
[4:11:48] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath please read what i've said about jax above :(

[4:12:52] Apodexis_: @imthetankdude you know oil lamps existed right?
[4:13:09] friendlycrackdealer: It being a lamp doesn't automatically mean its electric.  You do know lamps existed with just fatty oils and fire, right? KEKW
[4:13:24] iufoz: r u going in dry?
[4:13:34] BreeZaHGG: @friendlycrackdealer that doesn't sound realistic...
[4:13:39] petejones_1: they should make a leg lamp skin
[4:13:56] feetofdeath: @BreeZaHGG you trolling right? ? ?

[4:15:09] Hellboy743: wild rift skin hexplorer jax is electric rest skins is fire
[4:15:14] blue2327: sylas playing coop vs AI
[4:15:24] rettybol: i think it symbolizes the immortal hope of jax recovering/avenging icathia
[4:15:25] BreeZaHGG: @friendlycrackdealer hmm i dont think so buddy... maybe you have used to much of your own supply
[4:15:41] friendlycrackdealer: @BreeZaHGG you're definitely trolling KEKW
[4:15:43] Apodexis_: @breezahgg nah you have to be trolling

[4:15:53] Barungs: whats new
[4:16:05] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath but he killed an ascended, a demi god
[4:16:17] friendlycrackdealer: Let'
[4:16:27] BreeZaHGG: I miss the original lore from warcraft3 when he was a pimpdaddy who hung out at noodle bars
[4:16:33] rob_bac: wasnt that he stoped using weapons so it can be a fair fight?
[4:16:34] aevra14: i thought shacos lore was just that he has no lore
[4:16:39] anilvort3x: Shout out to Nautilus for being doggy doo doo water
[4:16:43] Ardal_Obe: that's because he's a clown
[4:16:50] blue2327: shaco is like his lore, a clown
[4:16:50] friendlycrackdealer: Lets just be glad with what we got in terms of lore, it could definitely be worse.
[4:17:01] derpstevenson: Shaco has lore. He is the king of the Insane Clown Posse 🤡
[4:17:01] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath would it be alright if you look at my chat log?
[4:17:05] nuttyrunner: the lazy lore
[4:18:06] BreeZaHGG: @rettybol no bro
[4:18:07] anilvort3x: we are lee  sin
[4:18:09] feetofdeath: "he just likes war" is a good enough reason to join a war Kappa
[4:18:12] iufoz: ahri
[4:18:28] MadSpectre47: "you cannot cage me, summoner."
[4:18:33] PunHok: yeah league was like a way to dispute political debates in the lore
[4:18:38] zain_________: @wingsofdeath do you watch fresh and fit podcast.?
[4:18:45] TwitchPat: With the mmo coming out sometime in the future, maybe they are trying to allign some backstories with how they intend them to be in that game?
[4:18:50] Exilefiend: they did it probably because they are building for the mmo
[4:18:54] kosem91: Wait if there are no more summoners what is "Flash" and "Ignite?" I thought that was your character intervening
[4:18:57] Vita51: i mean they had to to make all the other media
[4:18:57] BreeZaHGG: 90% of players dont even know there is a lore
[4:19:01] yiusmemelol: cluegi
[4:19:12] The_Jester141: Remember the Journal of Justice? Was released every month in the client.
[4:19:17] lakers656: It’s has nothing to do with league players
[4:19:17] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath alot of LOR, mmo enthusiast and arcane watcher care abit about lore
[4:19:26] lakers656: they want those Netflix shows and movies
[4:19:29] yiusmemelol: why is bro talking about champion lore play some chess or something queue up draven
[4:19:29] anilvort3x: leave it to rito to monetize lore, they're selling this shit now instead of making it about the players
[4:19:38] Ardal_Obe: yeah man, they haven't even told us what the scout code is
[4:19:49] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath ultimately riot did agree with you and they did fire so many writers/story creator that created these amazing lore
[4:19:49] Morkokuningas: league lore used to be very simple
[4:19:50] CranKextreme: i remember riven bunny skin has a backstory
[4:19:52] feetofdeath: they sel books?

[4:20:03] cancerchalupa: nah u got a point with that whole summoner point. shows how they changed their perspective
[4:20:14] MrDeathtoy: I've thought the same about the lore since like 2014 when they announced the lore may be reworked
[4:20:28] nuttyrunner: riot is really ambitious with their new projects
[4:20:42] MrDeathtoy: When they started reworking voice overs I was gutted
[4:21:09] rettybol: @Wingsofdeath u think so? i think after reading alot of stories some of the character never had more robust personalities
[4:21:14] Topburst: do you think Riot will make us choose wich tribe will be? like the region of freilord nexus demacia etc.
[4:21:18] caim922: Riven used to have a cool story
[4:21:43] pixlpit: ethincity: void
[4:22:25] iufoz: noxus and damacia kinda conflict
[4:22:28] iufoz: same with ionia
