[0:14:00] el_danixd: do u go rageblade 3rd on kaisa or cryptbloom?
[0:14:04] nightmarehost982: @nathan_botlane  i tried him but he is really reliant on landing w and r. and i am so bad at it
[0:14:13] SnuKies: You went with Lethal Tempo because of Tham, right? There are gonna be extended fights. Otherwise, Hail of Blades would have been better, correct ?
[0:14:37] insanity327: 10% damage no?
[0:14:51] Mercypl0x: you like eclipse more than shiv or situational?
[0:15:00] shaavola: Have you abandoned manamune completely with kaisa?
[0:15:02] nathan_botlane: nightmarehost982 true but if you stick to him you will really get better at spacing and farming
[0:15:18] nightmarehost982: @exnnt  maybe my problem is that I change  champion so often  like i play kaisa , jinx, ashe, twitch,
[0:15:19] nathan_botlane: honestly just stick to one champ for lots of games
[0:15:39] exnnt: im going for a coffee dont do anything cool while am gone ty

[0:15:53] kompyyyy: can you explain how you build kaisa these days? 󠀀

[1:33:47] maxozabojca99: thanks
[1:34:55] xamikkaze: i think the best adc in euw is suppa

[1:35:17] scriptkiddieno11: I don't get it they nerf sivir w alot and q but her range is one of the lowest like and she has no escape like common she is legit has been one of the worst for long time buff w and range by 50 champ is way better
[1:35:36] dentiso: sivir feels like the sona of adc

[2:03:11] unwoc: @alejandrorls checking the new E dmg

[2:03:45] dentiso: level 18 give u more damage

[2:03:50] ascuane: wait what
[2:03:51] ncc0: E max second?
[2:03:56] ascuane: ive been maxing e second always

[2:04:08] yusufasar_: ur not even full build
[2:04:22] atmnfps: gen g 2-0 hle unlucky
[2:04:27] unwoc: @ascuane no, E is pretty vital to be safe
[2:04:30] rework3097: i mean E is still lowkey useless unless u have high amount of stacks right so u would still max it last imo
[2:04:35] rework3097: damage wise i mean
[2:04:39] scriptkiddieno11: Go pen and try
[2:04:42] Thib0tski: Get 1 liandries to maybe

[2:05:24] imbastreamer1: 330 stacks is quite a lot no?
[2:05:31] scriptkiddieno11: Go pen instead of liandries
[2:05:33] unwoc: @killua_zo1dyck_ not really, but still pretty strong
[2:05:38] Fidus44: is liandries still good or is it not just worth to get more crit

[2:05:42] 1mbox: now hes kogmaw
[2:05:44] unwoc: @imbastreamer1 it's mid, based on the game length

[2:06:00] demon1_lol: is it just me or smolder looks bigger than last patch ? @Jackspektra

[2:07:54] alejandrorls: Its literallt core
[2:08:00] alejandrorls: On smolder
[2:09:06] olekron: mh no, not really
[2:09:25] unwoc: he already has in-built periodic dmg +his AD scaling is much more important
[2:09:35] 1mbox: Is eve nerf enough to not perma ban her?
[2:09:44] olekron: liandry is viable but definetly not core
[2:09:49] unwoc: AP on smol is niche stat

[2:13:35] alejandrorls: It gives +1% health true damage
[2:13:57] olekron: and other items just do more
[2:14:01] chen12345678910112: BAND
[2:14:07] unwoc: @alejandrorls it's too small comparing to the Q true dmg itself
[2:14:20] alejandrorls: Not navory, for sure
[2:14:27] alejandrorls: That is just bad
[2:14:37] Campus_Gaming_: Hi, I'm organizing a LoL online tournament, search Campus Gaming (@campusgaming1) on Instagram, it's this Saturday the 9th, based in Portugal. With a first prize of 150€, Thank you all guys.
[2:14:47] chen12345678910112: @Campus_Gaming_ bro
[2:14:50] chen12345678910112: gpq yourself
[2:15:14] unwoc: like why do you think that way? navori literally gives all abilites more dmg
[2:15:21] olekron: but it gives cdr and 20% dmg on abilitys @alejandrorls
[2:15:21] unwoc: out of crit %
[2:15:37] unwoc: like navori is just a major items for smol
[2:15:52] olekron: if you think liandrys is more dmg than navori you are bronze sry
[2:16:41] solstario: guys is this stream prerecorded? is that legal
[2:16:41] g4nl0cK: !opgg
[2:16:41] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/EUW/SPKTR-SPKTR
[2:16:41] olekron: only upside of your build is that you have hp and have more survivability
[2:17:08] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[2:17:08] olekron: @solstario its not, hes eating and is playing a video
[2:17:29] unwoc: @solstario he is watching his youtube vid
[2:18:05] 1Nickles: so you go er, shojin, rfc, navori?
[2:18:24] unwoc: @1Nickles navori before rfc
[2:18:33] unwoc: or depends on the matchup
[2:18:40] olekron: @1Nickles either that or switch navori and shojin
[2:18:55] olekron: @unwoc for me rfc is always 3rd, but i go navori 2nd
[2:19:00] 1Nickles: yeah rfc some games is kinda needed
[2:19:14] 1Nickles: otherwise you cant hit
[2:19:28] 1Nickles: ty guys
[2:19:38] olekron: and you can always free stack with rfc
[2:19:42] olekron: thats also big reason
[2:19:50] imbastreamer1: @Jackspektra will you try new buffed kog maw passive ? xD
[2:20:07] unwoc: @imbastreamer1 int kogmaw tech
[2:20:26] VayneIsLame: whats the difference between GM and Chall adc
[2:20:34] Zhedish: Limit testing on Kog KEKW
[2:20:38] exerciseball: good afternoon jack :)
[2:20:43] solstario: kogmaw can run between dragon and baron in passive form now
[2:20:45] chen12345678910112: kog is new nunu
[2:20:47] unwoc: @VayneIsLame consistency
[2:21:15] ashuyoxoxo: just does 20 things 5% better
[2:21:18] VayneIsLame: do u vod review ur own games
[2:21:18] ashuyoxoxo: and that adds up
[2:21:44] VayneIsLame: dno the best way to improve - watching myself or Ruler?
[2:22:37] solstario: I watch my replays to learn but all I can think is "this guy is cracked" and never learn anything
[2:22:46] chen12345678910112: ahahaha
[2:22:49] Dani_roa_: who do you feel like this best player is you played against in scrims and pro games?
[2:22:50] Zhedish: Do you play off stream?
[2:22:53] eithlol: isnt hubris kinda meh first item? considering u want to secure a kill in lane as draven, and not start to get value from it after securing that kill. it has some value mid to late game though
[2:22:56] imbastreamer1: did they nerf lethality varus?
[2:23:13] unwoc: i usually rewatch some of my deaths, to realise like why did I die in general
[2:23:48] alejandrorls: Jack, do you think this IS a buff or a nerf to smolder?
[2:23:51] h0llw: if swyroo is in lec does that mean you guys arent scrimming?
[2:23:52] pogankiss: @jackspektra will dirk nerfs affect samira's first buy?
[2:24:27] kilzgaard: best adcs this patch

[2:27:01] ADL1337: thank mr spktr
[2:27:12] levf77: wow sertuss to los heretics

[2:27:17] olekron: @yoelrorro_ if u die first u lose stacks first
[2:27:26] Quantummoon_: the biggest question is where is the eyes dont lie outro
[2:27:35] Goldstrike36: u think senna adc is still good ?
[2:28:03] 3Brick_: could someone tell me the runes and build for kaisa?
[2:28:15] VayneIsLame: how come u rarely go scaling health
[2:28:18] ADL1337: you're playing against messi?
[2:28:25] basicoloco: What mouse do you use if I may ask
[2:28:38] Quantummoon_: @3Brick_ depends on if you go poke, crit, onhit or full AP
[2:28:56] Wetru: @Jackspektra zwyroo is gonna play in lvp and lec at the same time?
[2:29:02] ADL1337: ruler giving all of us hope
[2:29:12] olekron: wait wat
[2:29:18] Quantummoon_: hes such a king for that
[2:29:22] 3Brick_: @Quantummoon_ poke and on hit please
[2:29:34] 3Brick_: i heard Eclipse into either Nashor or Kraken
[2:29:47] olekron: both good
[2:29:52] shiwamamo: is this a stream vod or what
[2:30:16] deniizz88: !proviee
[2:30:19] Zhedish: @Jackspektra i've seen people go triforce instead of essence on smolder, you think it's better?
[2:30:21] 1Nickles: i love kr raging tones its so funny
[2:30:31] deniizz88: !proview
[2:30:32] Nightbot: if jacks watching a lpl or lck proview its probably from this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@LPLlive/videos
[2:30:43] Quantummoon_: @3Brick_ onhit best i think is kraken Terminus rn with lethal tempo but every pro builds different, poke muramana ludens is viable
[2:30:50] Quantummoon_: but honestly there is a lot to build on kaisa
[2:31:01] rkgiac: tank smolder is the way
[2:31:09] olekron: why shojin over navori? @Jackspektra
[2:31:10] rkgiac: show me da way
[2:31:13] solstario: sivir still bad?
[2:31:17] DashyThy: you dont put 2 points on W anymore?
[2:31:20] solstario: agurin jungle maybe
[2:31:34] shiwamamo: oh its live
[2:31:35] shiwamamo: XD
[2:31:40] shiwamamo: I thought thats a vod
[2:31:44] shiwamamo: because of the overlay
[2:32:09] joseleo98: joseleo98 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:32:16] shiwamamo: I feel like kaisa lacks damage when u go ap against tanks
[2:32:24] solstario: its not live we just know what he will say and pretend to ask questions
[2:32:43] Quantummoon_: when to go which kaisa build? I just tend to do what i wanna play in that moment lmao
[2:33:22] h0llw: DIESOFCRINGE  not hsi video pls

[2:46:46] rul0u: eclipse? what build are u trying? full lethality?

[2:47:07] xYRNsoul: ive been going opportunity eclipse sundered sky on varus, so broken
[2:47:16] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @apmstomp eclipse hbas no lethality
[2:47:22] ADCPurple: @xYRNsoul you can build anything and champ is broken
[2:47:33] apmstomp: @FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW i just said eclipse is standart on kai sa now
[2:47:33] rul0u: @thebuzzzkilla true ive forgot
[2:47:47] Zhedish: what about the manamune, ludens and cryptbloom build?
[2:47:48] squidbub: how low does eclipse cd get with ingen hunter?
[2:47:52] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @apmstomp im not replying to u
[2:48:09] apmstomp: @FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW you literally are? xd?

[2:50:05] Patternz00: !opgg
[2:50:05] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/EUW/SPKTR-SPKTR
[2:50:18] petersen_lol: you should max w second with evolve no?
[2:50:20] nLeBrun7: if you go eclipse do you have to go nashors+shadowflame? or could u still go on hit?
[2:50:24] solstario: he's good at this game
[2:50:27] blushedx: snipa
[2:50:28] townofbird: love the sniping
[2:50:30] xYRNsoul: cleanliness
[2:50:32] oberynxxx: that was clean
[2:50:43] 365Doors: @squidbub with max stacks of ingenious, it's equal to 33% cdr. eclipse is normally 6 seconds, so with ingenious stacked it's 4 seconds
[2:50:48] thebuzzzkilla: @Jackspektra you really should not be alive, INGAME
[2:50:58] olekron: @nLeBrun7 you can go kraken rageblade after eclipse
[2:51:01] HyypeRLiFT: why cryptbloom over void does the haste and heal overpower the 10mp?
[2:51:08] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!
[2:51:23] lechien82895: @HyypeRLiFT also cheaper
[2:51:26] petersen_lol: but w is just better with ap kaisa isnt it?
[2:51:27] nLeBrun7: @olekron okay cool i figure that would prob be better
[2:51:37] lechien82895: @petersen_lol not really, ap ratio is bad
[2:51:37] live_jamie: hellou
[2:51:47] live_jamie: whats up with that font ingame?
[2:51:57] townofbird: nt
[2:52:28] ADCPurple: the font is disgusting
[2:52:29] thebuzzzkilla: this gameplay is so disgusting ur so tanky
[2:52:34] ADCPurple: ive been whining about it all day
[2:52:35] YoungPasawan: korean font probably
[2:52:46] Rom3TV: @Jackspektra if you had to choose which stat do you think is the best to track progress/usefulness with? Like cs/min, kda, etc.
[2:52:58] lechien82895: ppl just max stuff without reading what they get per lvl, same reason why ppl didn't max w day one on smolder, it was obvious but took ppl a full week
[2:53:37] rainnorway: camille:
[2:53:46] 1Nickles: camille what are we doin beast
[2:53:48] rases00: @lechien82895 75% of the playerbase only does what X youtuber/streamer does, so what is new?
[2:54:31] ZOMBIEBEARS: support mains trying to play champs requiring fingers KEKL
[2:55:21] h0llw: its not like camille is that hard is just support players are just  bad peepoShrug
[2:55:37] ADCPurple: bluetooth q
[2:55:38] TIBET1337: boink
[2:55:39] ADCPurple: nice riot
[2:55:59] wxd_lol: @Jackspektra is w max second not better with this build?
[2:56:21] fruwut: How late was that tp though
[2:56:22] ADCPurple: can i timeout that guy for 10
[2:56:32] ADCPurple: jokes
[2:56:54] lechien82895: well you see, we may have a fed adc and enemy adc is 0/7, but fighting a front-to-back doesn't sound as fun as randomly farming something so they personally feel more powerful
[2:57:04] L1am_Maynee: even of you kill him thjat dights so lost
[2:57:07] L1am_Maynee: sadge
[2:57:10] satty12345: what's the point of writing a 'gg' like Zyra did lmao
[2:57:15] xyzArmin: @ADCPurple if he thought it was better, he would do it dont you think?
[2:57:18] Chunko: zyra jungle such an F tier pick
[2:57:26] ADCPurple: @xyzArmin ???
[2:57:30] xyzArmin: wait i replyed wriong
[2:57:42] xyzArmin: wanted to replay the message below you
[2:57:44] xyzArmin: oops
[2:58:03] rhoetes: how do you get 100ad on q
[2:58:10] Quackologist: oh no
[2:58:16] Makun_: oh
[2:58:28] nLeBrun7: never sell dblade
[2:58:37] satty12345: what if you i.e. have 100 ad, upgrade Q and then have less? It gets downgraded back?
[2:58:45] townofbird: @satty12345 YEP
[2:58:46] L1am_Maynee: yes
[2:59:16] Quantummoon_: brohan moment
[2:59:29] squidbub: i know brohan when i see him the goat
[2:59:29] L1am_Maynee: sold dblade and lost adaptive ad so need lvl 15 if n0ot buying more ad
[2:59:31] lechien82895: @wxd_lol xayah/akali/leesin, enemy team comp is low range skirmish/assassin, E cd is way better than 25 dmg on W, E invis important vs their champs (also a bit more MS)
[2:59:34] 1Nickles: this ksante is running it man
[2:59:48] 1Nickles: how broken is his champ if he plays w team
[2:59:48] solstario: stay strong spektral... it is in the hardest moment of pressure that the coal becomes the diamond
[3:00:01] xDeekri: @solstario cold

[3:01:01] biki02: and his items lol
[3:01:35] lechien82895: team even has camille R to force fights, there is no reason to not be forcing 5v5s with the big AD dif in gold you guys had this game
[3:01:36] L1am_Maynee: how much ad to regain upgraded q?
[3:01:43] Dawi5d: he just hit 10 deaths powerspike so we gucci xd
[3:01:52] Ropresix: !song

[3:03:07] Ale561: @Jackspektra haven´t you felt like you´ve lost your touch when playing the game? Feeling like that recently
[3:03:28] solstario: does he want to play on wave so its harder for akali and lee to hit him?
[3:03:59] apmstomp: @solstario Its not play into the wave
[3:04:08] biki02: it forces the fight to be front to back with him and zyra not letting them get close
[3:04:10] lechien82895: @solstario harder to get flanked, harder to get forced out of fight if wukong or akali hold a chokepoint in jungle/river terrain fight
[3:04:36] mschini: why lethal tempo with AP build
[3:04:47] Quantummoon_: @mschini enemy are tanky
[3:05:05] lechien82895: by playing with the wave he didn't mean fight only when his team's minions are there to block skillshots, he meant take fights in the lane, because the terrain is better for his team than jungle/river
[3:05:37] solstario: I see thanks

[3:10:30] Alxteria: What do you think of playing with Janna players?
