[0:00:40] supercole2001: ayoo
[0:01:47] KayPea: is the new patch out?
[0:02:15] worldparadise420: hello Mr. Santorin
[0:02:26] KayPea: you’re spamming reksai today?
[0:02:51] jzipfel20: That and some heartsteel lux!
[0:02:54] supercole2001: Lucas is spamming trist jg today santorinHey
[0:03:11] worldparadise420: Red kayn and J-4 is OP af
[0:03:43] o0unknown: Buffed Brand jg
[0:04:06] KayPea: he consistently makes fun of me for playing heartsteel Lux santorinSad
[0:04:39] supercole2001: Heartsteel is the best item
[0:04:43] kaiserwroth: Holy early games santorini
[0:04:46] supercole2001: because more HP is good HP
[0:04:47] CallMeNesu: heartsteel lux is gigabrain Santorin just doesn't know it yet YEP
[0:04:49] ntmadeit: yo what's good
[0:05:11] KayPea: @callmenesu exactly santorinDark
[0:05:28] rexxarhero4: yo whatup!
[0:05:30] CallMeNesu: i had a viego mid turbosmash my irelia mid yesterday monkaW
[0:05:53] KayPea: he doesn’t know what it’s like playing a squishy immobile mage with a global taunt santorinFine
[0:05:56] rexxarhero4: its the korean one yh
[0:06:02] CallMeNesu: ye that's the font they use in korea
[0:06:29] rexxarhero4: (roa is not a real item except maybe on gragas and TF)
[0:06:41] KayPea: 10 mill health and do zero damage, we aren’t a melee champ that gets like 10x the dmg for no reason
[0:06:47] rexxarhero4: ^
[0:08:17] Arisutra: afternoon!
[0:08:18] hungdeacon: Bello
[0:08:38] o0unknown: brand got a 200 to 215 on passive damage (blaze) wouldn’t that make him clear faster be a buff or does the R nerf negate that
[0:09:01] jadedthoughts_: Good afternoon!
[0:09:02] Arisutra: that is how you say it :D
[0:09:50] hungdeacon: Look like game has new font in game
[0:10:23] Arisutra: looking forward to trying out some sivir in a bit. 4 armour at level 1 seems like a huge buff.
[0:13:49] NitricAcidvsMetal: have you not heard of azzapp?
[0:14:15] CallMeNesu: i feel like the w being back to full aoe regular knockup is gonna feel real nice in fights. hated that change so much
[0:14:58] arthalie: Riot is really trying to keep ad tf viable but not op, and I just don't think it's doable, he's arguably a 4 role flex and riot never seems to like anything being viable in more than 2 roles
[0:15:33] honorbound69: Incoming ff
[0:16:14] Boh14: i mean veigo has 100% kp
[0:16:22] CallMeNesu: azzapp doing his new MS velkoz tech POGGERS
[0:17:10] arthalie: He got a compensation buff in the jg because they nerfed his champ damage
[0:17:20] arthalie: Brand^
[0:17:22] brightdiscord: what happened to the font? peepoRiot
[0:17:31] Jaguarpaw29: haha brand is fine
[0:17:37] Jaguarpaw29: you guys are funny.
[0:18:45] ntmadeit: we need dopamine as well
[0:18:53] CallMeNesu: passive from 200->215% dmg for taking 25 and 50 dmg from his R and upping the cd by 5-15 seconds seems real good for brand jg tbh
[0:18:58] Jaguarpaw29: caffeine close enough to dopamine
[0:19:01] Jaguarpaw29: lol
[0:20:02] arthalie: Think reksai is a stridebreaker or profane champ now?
[0:20:31] Jaguarpaw29: veigar gonna be scary tho D:
[0:20:53] Soliy1: its lovely lucas uwu
[0:20:54] Falcnation: melee range smolder op
[0:21:23] jzipfel20: more voli today?
[0:21:26] BleachIceCream: @arthalie stride or titanic
[0:21:36] shadow7master: peepoHey  how is the day
[0:21:44] rvend: yoo my goat hows the reksai jungle perform?
[0:21:49] arthalie: What about Titanic with press the attack?
[0:21:52] Falcnation: calling reksai a he >:(
[0:22:30] annehappy318: Her w not bug?
[0:22:51] rvend: WTF ITS SO SLIPPERY
[0:22:56] rvend: like wha
[0:23:00] shadow7master: he lives Pog
[0:23:22] annehappy318: Her w not bug ?
[0:23:34] Lerocler: the W bug is destroying me man, the buffs are great but god damn
[0:23:39] CallMeNesu: ye making them actual autos and not a spell is huge
[0:23:40] rvend: i see
[0:24:16] Lerocler: the range of  AA while  burrowed is bigger than W range, so sometimes you click on someone and then just stand up and AA them
[0:25:31] Lerocler: Yeah i usually do too, but in the middle of team fights it can be really noticeable, especially if youre changing targets and stuff
[0:25:44] geralt360: Is reksai saved?
[0:26:41] Lerocler: yeah, just click on someone and  cancel right before, youll unburrow accidentally
[0:27:04] Arisutra: hwei does not respect science
[0:27:19] annehappy318: Practice tool?
[0:27:37] geralt360: Limit testing
[0:27:40] Lerocler: it's if you cancel to like "keep moving" right before knocking up
[0:27:41] BleachIceCream: aa or w is not bigger anymore
[0:27:45] BleachIceCream: they are teh same
[0:27:47] arthalie: IDK how they could really solve that issue though, best way would probably be to disable autos during burrow or reduce her auto range to 125 but that also feels really rough
[0:28:03] Lerocler: or if youre just following someone 1 on 1 you cant reach them
[0:28:05] BleachIceCream: w used to be bigger range than aa
[0:28:12] Arisutra: the smolder carry copium? haha
[0:28:32] Lerocler: THERE
[0:28:50] Lerocler: it went on that one because it knocked up before you reached the big one
[0:29:11] Lerocler: yeah it does still work, it just unborrows early
[0:29:19] brightdiscord: do it
[0:30:01] Lerocler: yeah that was it
[0:30:17] bot1nant: Is the new patch out?
[0:30:17] annehappy318: That one
[0:30:19] Falcnation: is ad tf finally dea
[0:30:24] Falcnation: dead
[0:30:34] Arisutra: hope so
[0:30:46] Dntspeedup: santorinWave santorinWave santorinWave
[0:30:51] Lerocler: imo, they just hotfix reduce the AA range while burrowed to what it was before or increas knock up range
[0:30:53] annehappy318: Fix for next patch
[0:31:05] BleachIceCream: it was fine before, pressing w is the best way to use it anyway
[0:31:06] TrueVlaren: Have you tried full tank Rek'sai? I think it's pretty underrated even on this patch
[0:31:17] Arisutra: smolder: "I SCALE LADS LETSGOOOO"
[0:31:35] Praetor_GG: EZ
[0:31:51] annehappy318: So reksai good?
[0:32:03] Lazarus92: probably steraks into sunfire or something
[0:32:04] arthalie: Bami, Titanic rookern? That's what id assume
[0:32:11] TrueVlaren: Aftershock bamis into either iceborn, I max Q into W as well
[0:32:16] Falcnation: 12 chests no keys, stop being toxic and get key fragments Kappa
[0:32:36] Lerocler: i agree it feels amazing now except for that one bug
[0:32:42] shadow7master: velkoz dmg
[0:33:05] darkkkona: I want old reksai ult. Tempo ults were the thing we needed
[0:33:17] annehappy318: Play 5 games  reksai to find out pls
[0:33:21] TrueVlaren: You still have pretty good base dmg as reksai, you just play it to setup other lanes and just be a full tank
[0:33:28] bot1nant: Sorry but is new patch out?
[0:33:39] TrueVlaren: You can check my opgg Vlaren#True, if you scroll down a bit
[0:33:41] ThePeePuddle: Gooood day Sir! How's the day going? santorinWave santorinComfy
[0:33:46] Burgerbrater1702: J4 is hopefully back again in meta but there's some doubt
[0:33:48] Rodzy: @Santorin howd the reksai feel?
[0:33:53] daemunblaze: Good Morning Santorin. How are you?
[0:34:13] arthalie: I want reksai s old ult on a new champion
[0:34:16] darkkkona: Yea tank only
[0:34:29] Lerocler: you can reallyyy feel  the buffs to R right now
[0:34:53] Lerocler: it actually feels like it does any damage at all which is great
[0:35:01] arthalie: Same with old urgot, mordekaiser dragon, and skarner spires since they're removing them with his rework
[0:35:21] daemunblaze: How are you? @Santorin
[0:35:33] Lerocler: try shojin if you get ahead maybe?
[0:36:04] TrueVlaren: I think if you wanna go bruiser, you just go cleaver, since it's just so strong
[0:36:22] smol_lol: !opgg
[0:36:22] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Santorini%20Panini-EUW & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/SantariniPanini-JGDIF & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ChatDisabler97-MUTE

[0:36:50] arthalie: Sundered sky eclipse cleaver with press the attack maybe? Shit Load of ad for the initial crit
[0:37:23] Lerocler: oh yeahh THANK GOD for the belveth nerf
[0:37:33] TrueVlaren: I feel like this change will hurt her but she still is strong
[0:37:50] Lerocler: yeah literally a brick wall giving you a back massage
[0:38:01] turnsgreene: is patch out?
[0:38:16] darkkkona: Ive never seen Belveth succeed in pro play KEKW
[0:38:57] Arisutra: removing mythics has made itemising feel so much better
[0:39:07] turnsgreene: Have you seen the upcoming lethality nerfs
[0:39:14] Lerocler: red kayn's buffs look pretty big no? thoughts? i hate facing him with reksai
[0:39:15] Praetor_GG: her scaling is linear
[0:39:31] arthalie: Its like pro play nasus but you don't get a massive atk speed slow
[0:39:37] annehappy318: try balc frost skin @Santorin
[0:40:19] Arisutra: TUNE
[0:40:39] 88Architects: how dont you have all the champions already
[0:40:41] Praetor_GG: master yi cost 450 KEKW
[0:40:56] darkkkona: Aware 30 yeara ago
[0:41:02] geralt360: Look at Yumi's cost in shop
[0:41:19] A_Iex: they changed costs to not be off release date, not sure why
[0:41:28] Arisutra: they redid a load of champ prices in the shop, ryze and kayle cost 4800 now  haha
[0:41:33] Obeez: might have something to do with supply and demand, play rate etc
[0:41:34] Lerocler: they dont do them by order of release anymore, they have a  weird system now
[0:41:35] brightdiscord: 55 years ago Aware
[0:41:39] geralt360: I bought yumi for 450 BE
[0:41:48] Praetor_GG: jhin costs 4444 haHAA
[0:41:50] AndreiBass: they adjusted recently so champions are based on their difficulty
[0:41:50] geralt360: skill level i think
[0:41:51] darkkkona: Thata bullshit
[0:41:53] arthalie: I think general difficulty
[0:41:59] Lerocler: i think they base it on difficulty
[0:42:06] geralt360: @Lerocler Yeah
[0:42:08] AndreiBass: yummi is 450 for example

[1:16:59] DeathWaffle: Lee Carry Kappa
[1:17:15] arthalie: So riot has made a bunch of healing tanks/mobile tanks, should we get a pure shielding tank as a new champion?
[1:17:59] arthalie: Biggest buff would legit be extra base movement speed
[1:18:23] nwa4lifeTV: they reverted the j4 nerf
[1:18:44] NeverWorse95: @Santorin Diana's passive got finally fixed. It procs every 3 autos again!

[1:24:14] Bazeloth: 5 less movement speed = a big deal on nid?
[1:24:36] KillerB123: "reksai has been burrowed for far too long"
[1:25:59] Falcnation: so many fill queues
[1:26:02] shockking1: i feel like that nidalee nerf is too much like she got hit the same way as fuckign maokai...
[1:26:31] Bazeloth: Im sad they didnt bring back Rek'Sai's old R back
[1:27:03] Falcnation: plus if you target ban it could be yet another dodge
[1:27:03] koushik_10: wait why are u auto filled again in a row
[1:27:05] koushik_10: what
[1:27:06] ijzerenman: What was his old ult? @Bazeloth i forgot
[1:27:07] arthalie: The only reason nidalee wasn't s tier in pro play was because of rookern, now that rookern got tapped down I swear she would have been pick ban
[1:27:27] Amorello: Garen xd
[1:27:28] Social_Phobia: shen? ^^
[1:27:36] Amorello: Aatrox?
[1:27:36] Falcnation: trundle top?
[1:27:50] Praetor_GG: @arthalie but why
[1:27:53] arthalie: Renekton
[1:28:29] Bazeloth: @ijzerenman When she had a tunnel laying somewhere you could burrow underground from anywhere to it. Like a Twisted Fate teleport. You'd hear a global scream before she went underground.
[1:28:32] koushik_10: just ply olaf giga chad
[1:28:35] Grynox15: @Santorin What do you think about the state of jungle compared to other roles?
[1:28:37] Bazeloth: The tunnels now are useless pretty much
[1:28:41] morbidnumbskull: You're just gonna play Hull Ganre KEKW
[1:28:46] morbidnumbskull: Garen*
[1:28:51] moppin_de_ting_yeh: TRUNDLE
[1:28:52] BleachIceCream: bro her tunnels are not useless
[1:28:54] ijzerenman: @Bazeloth ohhhh true, i really liked that too
[1:28:54] BleachIceCream: what are u on about
[1:28:56] moppin_de_ting_yeh: TRUNDLE..
[1:28:57] odolofonos1: trundle
[1:29:10] morbidnumbskull: Demolish
[1:29:18] ijzerenman: anti-cringe
[1:29:19] Virtualmagi: I want to see how this is going to work
[1:29:26] koushik_10: lethal better ithink
[1:29:27] Bazeloth: Petition to bring back reksai's old R @Santorin
[1:29:35] BleachIceCream: rek old r is dog
[1:29:36] shockking1: i feel like you nasty regret this setup
[1:29:42] Falcnation: just perma split screw tp lol
[1:29:44] morbidnumbskull: Lethal is nerfed
[1:29:49] Amorello: Lol dodge queue simulator
[1:30:20] Griefclaw: give the true bac
[1:30:20] Social_Phobia: imo when reksai was released the game was VERY different ^^
[1:30:21] BleachIceCream: no to mention new r can literally dodge anything if timed properly
[1:30:25] BleachIceCream: way better than new r
[1:30:35] stoicHolcan: the farm alarm :o
[1:30:40] odolofonos1: anyone remember when they changed Zac R to that grab pull back crap ? I quit the game in protest
[1:30:52] shockking1: pta + ignite is hard cheese angle no?
[1:30:54] Amorello: Omg riot
[1:30:54] Bazeloth: An extra ability to damage people is nice, but reksai's identity right now is so much less with her new R
[1:31:05] jzipfel20: Morde top?
[1:31:14] arthalie: @praetor_gg nidalee is a lot more flexible than other AP assassins like Evelyn and Elise, and with doublr bruiser/melee solo lanes popping up more it gives good poke around objectives, rookern was a huge counter to her because it meant you just needed one champ like Ksante or nautilus building it and standing in front of your senna/zero and you're useless. With MR itemization and a lot of the s tier tanks getting worse lane matchups she now has the ability to deal reliable damage to even tanks
[1:31:34] stoicHolcan: its gotta be TF right?
[1:31:41] stoicHolcan: or did TF get nerfed?
[1:31:42] odolofonos1: Tf , vayne
[1:32:05] Virtualmagi: looks like top lane
[1:32:15] shockking1: yeah this top role is disgusting and should be nuked
[1:32:16] ijzerenman: and still you get autofilled top
[1:32:16] raph2316: time to bring the tank kench top and eat some folks
[1:32:26] MightyW0x: Looks like every toplane ever
[1:32:41] shockking1: wait its your turn to be the vayne top
[1:32:42] morbidnumbskull: Only high elo gets a jg fill KEKW
[1:32:42] giroxeplug: kench ttop????
[1:32:54] arthalie: I swear it's sej top xD safe lane and you don't need to rely on your team for engage
[1:32:58] morbidnumbskull: in my emerald elo, Support and Jungle gets prio LUL
[1:33:01] odolofonos1: top again
[1:33:04] annehappy318: @Santorin is reksai good with spear of shojin or cleaver?
[1:33:08] Amorello: Lol I think you're playing dodgeball not LoL
[1:33:17] Bazeloth: Damn these queues are long
[1:33:23] DeathWaffle: Gonna get support now
[1:33:25] GideonBast: 8 dodges in a row now?
[1:33:46] morbidnumbskull: If i queue mid: 6mins , when I queue jungle: 35 seconds KEKW
[1:33:51] Bazeloth: 15 winstreak
[1:33:54] Bazeloth: wut
[1:34:03] ijzerenman: you should be able to 1v1 someone else to determin who is autofill
[1:34:04] bunses: smurfing in chall
[1:34:06] arthalie: I will die on the hill that sejuani top is still broken but Ksante was just better until last patch
[1:34:07] shockking1: he might be a bit too good
[1:34:26] shockking1: someone check his PC for illegally
[1:34:41] GideonBast: honestly I just hope they keep nerfing K’sante  every patch
[1:34:43] ijzerenman: Noo the other person is on the other team
[1:34:50] GideonBast: until that champ is a fever dream
[1:34:51] ijzerenman: so he will be autofilled there 5Head
[1:35:07] shockking1: yeah idk how that is all for senna
[1:35:39] shockking1: it's supposed to be buff for support buff for ad
[1:35:44] shockking1: for sera
[1:35:47] arthalie: Sera farming nerfs, support buff
[1:35:48] koushik_10: does jarvan ult stop olaf even if he is in ult ? @Santorin
[1:35:53] NeverWorse95: They should introduce first pick over role preference. I think it would be a great addition Kappa
[1:35:59] morbidnumbskull: If her mana regen is buffed, her healing/shielding also increases because of the new support item
[1:36:01] Arisutra: yeah, pushing her more into a supportive role
[1:36:08] morbidnumbskull: the item that scales healing with mana regen
[1:36:12] xgreatscottx: @koushik_10 yes jarvan ult is terrain, not cc
[1:36:25] Arisutra: wait, wtf, i didn't know that was a thing either
[1:36:58] Arisutra: no wonder that champ was highest winrate bot laner for several patches, she couldn't mess up farming hahaha
[1:37:08] shockking1: i think they want all her QWE to be viable to max for supp sera
[1:37:14] GideonBast: they honestly have the worst changes to seraphine everytime. t
[1:37:15] arthalie: Fasting senna gets hit a lot harder by the q nerf since her stacks gave her ad and she generally went heavy lethality, the nerf is a lot smaller to crit senna
[1:37:16] morbidnumbskull: Sivir buff is irrelevant, meta botlanes do mixed dmg
[1:37:28] xgreatscottx: @Santorin thoughts on j4 with the changes? Armor Growth is nice but j4 is in need of more than Q CD and armor
[1:37:31] kingmagier: yes
[1:37:35] Praetor_GG: ah so scaling is more linear
[1:37:35] GideonBast: Riot can’t stick to a champ design they don’t know how to design someone for a role anymore
[1:37:46] iiNumb3rz: Midtorin
[1:37:54] Bazeloth: Malzahar time? Pog
[1:37:56] GideonBast: look at Nafiri… the pack hunter jungle oh wait
[1:37:58] iiNumb3rz: Bjergsen zilean time?

[1:42:52] odolofonos1: want to watch a game today
[1:43:01] Arisutra: so, if i want to get to challenger, i should be rabid in pregame chat?
[1:43:23] Bazeloth: I like your streaming style San. I don't know why but other league streamers have the urge to scream a lot. You are pretty chill to listen to and i learn a lot cheer100
[1:43:26] ChicoLoLxD: last time I watched u play reksai, u said the autos felt so weird with new q. do u still feel that way?
[1:43:30] Tritros: we got the fiora what could go wrong
[1:43:36] Slockthesock: okay, ty

[1:43:51] DeathWaffle: Full AD team? LOL
[1:43:55] odolofonos1: gg another lobby
[1:44:00] arthalie: My thoughts were bruiser with PTA is that you'd have to rush Titanic for the auto reset so you can play it like a burst build
[1:44:07] ijzerenman: @Bazeloth not a kesha enjoyer Sadge
[1:44:16] xgreatscottx: POPPY

[1:46:36] bunses: do run down patch now
[1:46:46] Amorello: My fav thing is every time you go to the next patch note queue pops over the top of the words haha
[1:46:56] antisuji: 55% ad scaling down seems pretty big
[1:47:07] A_Iex: look at the TF ad ratio nerf on E, it’s huge
[1:47:10] odolofonos1: why even queue up if you don’t want to play though lol 😂
[1:47:17] arthalie: To be faieid love a game of just drafting, I love watching pro play champ selects xD

[1:48:08] ijzerenman: dodging is like ffing ingame
[1:48:09] ChicoLoLxD: wtf this isn’t bottom fiora
[1:48:14] shockking1: i have a feeling nidalee top will be pretty hurt from the nerf
[1:48:20] Arisutra: i don't get why they thought an adc with a point and click stun was healthy for the game haha
[1:48:27] Falcnation: is it time for the smurf this queue is horrible

[2:15:34] Masterbob122: Yeah its not a great look that all our younger candidates are just as crazy just not as distinguished.  Can't we just clone Obama?
[2:15:46] FranckTRN: jankosHi

[2:15:58] dkvukster: @Praetor_GG The same people pulling the strings :D
[2:16:22] Praetor_GG: just dont start with the politics chat it's not going to go well for you LUL

[2:18:17] morbidnumbskull: You think Mondo go where he pleases? WRONG it's Jax who truly go where he pleases and does whatever he wants @Santorin
[2:18:32] Arisutra: it's not bullying if they're cringe, fax

[2:19:33] Praetor_GG: @Arisutra Hmm
[2:19:37] lucillelane: That was un-bear-able
[2:19:43] morbidnumbskull: That's NA humor right there... CLEANSE HIM! CLEANSE HIM!
[2:19:45] A_Iex: you think shojins viable for bruiser rek?
[2:19:59] iman_mzn: reksai buff W in my book

[2:20:27] Praetor_GG: ok
[2:20:30] TheTrakker: the breakdance moves
[2:20:34] morbidnumbskull: You spent too much time in NA... u must be cleansed!
[2:20:40] MurkMike: black cleaver seems fire with q cd
[2:20:48] CrimeSkeleton: maybe its time for me to return to the void queen
[2:20:53] dkvukster: my team was bullying me last game even tho we was winning - its hard to learn jungle SadgeCry but not giving up :)
[2:21:05] roderickyeow: can you play a game of red kayn please?
[2:21:11] Praetor_GG: @dkvukster chat off, learn game ok
[2:21:17] Amorello: Tbf better than getting - cause of a terrible Lee sin!!

[2:21:43] iiNumb3rz: @dkvukster don't play with chat on. It's not worth.
[2:21:45] r0ckey: new meta tech
[2:21:45] Praetor_GG: tbf if voli gets a lead prob build whatever you want
[2:21:47] motorboater2: Hey but dont worry, Riot said they fixed the LP gain/losses! Surely it should be good now.... right ?
[2:21:50] dkvukster: @Praetor_GG yea that my new plan /deafen
[2:21:53] Arisutra: he's a technician, damn
[2:22:05] lucillelane: @motorboater2 Hahaha...
[2:22:07] dkvukster: @iiNumb3rz ill do it from now on ill just deafen
[2:22:17] iiNumb3rz: @dkvukster just mute all in settings menu
[2:22:18] quietkiid: hey i was the ashe in that game, do you have any tips for me to improve ? much love <3
[2:22:28] eliotxshadowfrost21: better than yesterday. Had a root canal done yesterday and my jaw locked up mid procedure. then went and had a dental cleaning not even 30 minutes after so my mouth is tore the fuck up!
[2:22:32] iiNumb3rz: And if they start pinging you crazy, mute that too.
[2:22:34] arthalie: So, being a terror, if he swaps the shurelyas for trailblazer he could play it like maokai
[2:22:37] dkvukster: @iiNumb3rz ahhh - thats a good idea
[2:22:47] MurkMike: did black cleaver feel better or sundered
[2:23:01] dkvukster: @iiNumb3rz ty
[2:23:10] TrueVlaren: You haven't played the tank Rek'sai yet right?
[2:23:36] bot1nant: Is bel now fair after the nerf?
[2:23:48] DJ_Photik: Morning Santorin hi chat
[2:23:55] xgreatscottx: j4 game?
[2:24:00] cyberdefender9: what’s the verdict on rek’sai?
[2:24:14] browy_eu: hey, i was ashe’s arrow in that game, do you have any tips for me to improve?
[2:24:32] quietkiid: really appreciated, gl in your games <3
[2:24:46] Bazeloth: Flash abuser build lets gooo
[2:24:57] catlover12435: yeah i saw one :)
[2:24:57] AxArme: that one dive missed
[2:24:59] aln045: hey im the ashes mom :) just wanted to say thanks for the kind words about my son
[2:25:04] FranckTRN: It seems You got stunned by Ashe arrows, that's for sure!
[2:25:12] bot1nant: Aftershock?
[2:25:27] shockking1: hey im ashes ward
[2:25:33] shockking1: any advice?
[2:25:43] TrueVlaren: I love playing celarity waterwalking secondary on tank reksai
[2:25:47] TrueVlaren: And W max second
[2:26:03] Arisutra: ewww maokai supp abuser
[2:26:17] iiNumb3rz: Was that a knower in chat?
[2:27:45] shockking1: i feel like this may end up being insanely useless tbh
[2:27:45] morbidnumbskull: I dunno chief, full tank seems wrong
[2:27:53] Arisutra: rush jak'sho for the flex
[2:27:56] TrueVlaren: That tunnel cd got lower the patch before, so not maxing it doesn't change much actually
[2:28:47] FranckTRN: Yes but it's always support in your team that is :D
[2:31:32] TheTrakker: xddTeletubbies
[2:32:25] Danishshadow: We win these
[2:32:32] waynekerrishere: wait,why are you trolling? You will play rek'sai jungle but you won't play the most broken jungler atm? Zilean
[2:34:08] Arisutra: daamn, he played the first part of that gank so well
[2:34:21] Bazeloth: Can they interrupt your E?
[2:34:54] nwa4lifeTV: old reksai used to build tiamat and it was good
[2:35:37] TrueVlaren: I think Sunfire Kaenic Jaksho is the build here
[2:35:48] nwa4lifeTV: i remember reksai cinder
[2:35:52] nwa4lifeTV: those were also good times
[2:36:04] morbidnumbskull: Ey boss, do you drink coffee before you stream? @Santorin
[2:36:17] toxicgamesonly: I hate junglers and adcs.... But thats usually cause JG dont gank and adc run it down
[2:36:29] TheTrakker: you mean like you want yuumi on the enemy team and pyke on yours? xdd
[2:36:42] ObsceneSanity: this is the third or fourth time on stream I’ve seen top lane just refuse to go back top against urgot. urgot that unfun to play against?
[2:36:53] Arisutra: as an adc main, i hate the support on my team too most games LUL
[2:37:04] Bazeloth: "hehe i almost died"
[2:37:08] Bazeloth: LUL
[2:37:12] morbidnumbskull: They had to make supports strong because no one would play the role if the support champs are truly "supporting"
[2:37:41] toxicgamesonly: What @Santorin is saying is that... If you go 0-3 stop building dmg items and go tank and play safer instead of dying 10x more
[2:38:03] lucillelane: @morbidnumbskull Agreed. Coming from someone who used to play Morgana support lmao
[2:38:09] TrueVlaren: Kaenic is still good
[2:38:38] arthalie: Spirit visage to increase passive healing? The earmorg 3rd
[2:38:48] arthalie: Warmogs
[2:39:15] morbidnumbskull: @lucillelane I got out of gold by playing Vex in support role, and out of platinum by playing Briar
[2:39:56] moppin_de_ting_yeh: they are there cuz akshan revived them
[2:40:17] TrueVlaren: MagiFelix is just too 1v9 it's unplayable
[2:40:33] Arisutra: omg they nerfed maokai's movement speed and we're seeing the effects
[2:40:35] henthedinosaur: did rek get buffed
[2:40:37] Arisutra: riot are 5head
[2:40:40] lucillelane: @morbidnumbskull Gotta love non-support players that can still play "support"
[2:40:41] mr_sizzler007: the skins are still unavailable for purchase any idea when they are gonna be up
[2:41:26] nwa4lifeTV: did u knockup a minion?
[2:41:30] browy_eu: this evening @mr_sizzler007
[2:41:33] morbidnumbskull: @lucillelane it all started when they moved Xerath from midlane to a "support"
[2:41:34] TrueVlaren: You didn't have knock ready
[2:41:39] P_C_: it was still on cd
[2:41:41] TrueVlaren: He was knocked when you were running
[2:41:58] lucillelane: @morbidnumbskull Yes. Xerath and Vel'koz
[2:42:03] AndreiBass: yea, knock wasn't ready
[2:42:29] TrueVlaren: I think it's alright if you have strong laners and need a tank in the jungle
[2:42:47] nwa4lifeTV: max w now?
[2:42:53] arthalie: I want to scream Titanic but it's against the spirit of tank reksai
[2:43:01] morbidnumbskull: @lucillelane Zyra, Lux, velkoz, Brand, Xerath... those are not true supports... riot just want to please everyone by making all role feel like PROTAGONISTS
[2:43:27] motorboater2: The new font is nice af btw
[2:43:29] morbidnumbskull: Told ya, tank reksai is bad news
[2:43:31] lardyparty: beep boop I r tank reksai
[2:43:32] motorboater2: in game
[2:44:06] nwa4lifeTV: urgot new ksante cfmed
[2:44:27] Arisutra: RIP k'sante
[2:44:35] Arisutra: just as got the prestige skin for him, they gutted his ult
[2:44:54] motorboater2: How come when i play urgot, i dont do that dmg
[2:45:15] lucillelane: ^^ What my friend always used to say LMFAO
[2:46:20] lardyparty: nooooooooooo
[2:46:43] Phiewter: EZ
[2:46:44] nwa4lifeTV: ap
[2:46:47] morbidnumbskull: It wouldnt, u have rookern
[2:47:00] browy_eu: ad+ap
[2:47:21] Arisutra: it scales off AD but does AP damage
[2:47:25] morbidnumbskull: It has AD an AP scaling but the nature of the damage is MAGIC
[2:47:28] nwa4lifeTV: as in the r damage is maigc but scales off ap and ad
[2:48:22] morbidnumbskull: That's what makes Smolder good late game, coz he deals Physical and Magic (passive) at the same time
[2:48:41] Arisutra: hybrid damage adcs are the way right now
[2:48:57] Arisutra: smolder, kai'sa, ezreal, varus
[2:49:20] nwa4lifeTV: youve muted the ihop guy before
[2:49:31] morbidnumbskull: Vayne is also hybrid dmg, we tend to forget TRUE DAMAGE is also a type of damage LUL
[2:49:35] Arisutra: or be vayne and just deal true damage
[2:49:41] Arisutra: ^ yeah ahaha
[2:50:01] TheTrakker: HUH
[2:50:06] lardyparty: rooted?
[2:50:09] nwa4lifeTV: did he dodge your r?
[2:50:17] morbidnumbskull: @Arisutra I used to think true damage is just a stronger version of physical damage...but it's not
[2:50:27] lardyparty: that's what I thought, weird
[2:50:30] LoudDerp: i didn't even see it go off
[2:50:52] Arisutra: @morbidnumbskull vayne thinks tank stats are for cringelords
[2:50:52] ObsceneSanity: tanksei no good
[2:51:08] motorboater2: RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT
[2:51:08] Nightbot: @TheTrakker -> I can do this all day... [stop posting links] [warning]
[2:51:29] TheTrakker: damn it nightbot
[2:51:40] bitttahbastard: idk rek did not have enough dmg or utility to justify the pick there
[2:51:50] LoudDerp: must have been a bug
[2:52:06] hazygreys: bugs? in league of legends?
[2:52:08] hansel_lionheart: what do you mean? Reworked rek'sai has no bugs at all!
[2:52:08] TheTrakker: ads jaymay1Derpmin
[2:52:42] paradisi_: WAYTOODANK
[2:52:45] nwa4lifeTV: monkaW
[2:53:01] browy_eu: wait rito seriously gave brand more dmg in jungle vipeMonka
[2:53:33] annehappy318: @Santorin pta runes next
[2:53:36] annehappy318: or hob
[2:53:37] TheTrakker: especially not in conjunction with viego YEP
[2:54:00] nooch9: new reksai changes out?
[2:54:05] Arisutra: watch a vex now carry this game and you have no idea why she's so strong ;)
[2:54:23] Bazeloth: @Santorin is there a way to start league without going through their launcher? I never play TFT or Valorant, but even if i pin league it always starts the launcher
[2:54:47] Oblivixn1999: I'd rather see Brand jg than Karthus
[2:55:11] BleachIceCream: there's Riot Client and League of Legends u should be opening the .exe of league
[2:55:24] dotherightthing7: have you played 2 games in an hour Pog
[2:55:49] JSkillz_lol: Hey
[2:56:26] JSkillz_lol: I advice you to not play reksai on main W & R Bugged Q feels off
[2:56:43] Oblivixn1999: @Santorin whats the best way to learn a new champion? I want to start playing Nidalee but I don't wanna int lol
[2:57:38] FranckTRN: Didn't they change LP gains to be less punishing? Or was it for NA only
[2:57:41] JSkillz_lol: R cancels when cced at start
[2:57:48] CrimeSkeleton: practice tool clear for sure @Oblivixn1999
[2:57:48] Bazeloth: @BleachIceCream Thanks i didnt realize i was starting the launcher. its confusing. Theres 2 league of legends that are pinnable. First is the league client and the second is the riot launcher. Both contain an L
[2:57:54] Oblivixn1999: thanks!
[2:58:08] JSkillz_lol: but y stride/titanic are best with conq
[2:58:11] JSkillz_lol: gl anyways
[2:58:24] KyleKyleArgyle: this is an S Tier song
[3:00:22] krummel: Did Reksai get fixed now?
[3:01:08] hooostin: chat is 14.5 live already?
[3:01:15] turnsgreene: yes its live
[3:03:04] reuvencl: reksai feels good, but i prefer belveth any day
[3:03:43] LoudDerp: reksai is the og monster mommy
[3:03:44] hooostin: @reuvencl bel is just too clunky for me to play her :(
[3:04:00] cyberdefender9: the wind what brothers? XD
[3:04:48] cyberdefender9: same
[3:04:51] bunses: same
[3:04:54] FranckTRN: the Yeet bros
[3:05:08] Praetor_GG: I started playing yas a little bit recently actually kinda fun
[3:05:16] bunses: if i get them on my game sometimes i just dodge
[3:05:25] Praetor_GG: do not like yone, feels weird to play, maybe I just don't get it
[3:05:50] motorboater2: Zedd players
[3:05:51] hooostin: @Santorin some rek sai players do e max, what are your thoughts?
[3:07:12] antisuji: do you like playing with yasuo? I think it's really fun to set him up. Although I see them feed more than a lot of other champions.
[3:07:23] lpg100: has anyone asked him if he has noticed the bug in the reddit thread
[3:07:38] Praetor_GG: after playing yas I kinda understand, champ makes you feel like you can do crazy shit
[3:08:18] Bazeloth: Look at Zacs build: holds tab for 1s
[3:08:22] Bazeloth: :|
[3:08:22] MyMindIsAFK13: Its usually the type of people that play Yas and Yone. Usually bad temperment imo.
[3:08:26] Praetor_GG: @Bazeloth PepeLaugh
[3:08:59] mitch_mitch_mitch: balanced :)
[3:09:34] lpg100: old E he die
[3:09:37] Bazeloth: I mean before i figured out where zac is on the scoreboard the board is already closed lol
[3:10:20] smartasspawn: @Bazeloth me: hmm zac has 3 blurs
[3:10:47] bunses: RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype RISE KomodoHype
[3:10:54] juulripper_: any tips on getting out of gold 4? I play almost perfect every game but my bot lane sucks so bad
[3:10:56] Bazeloth: do allies see RekSai's passive? like the gray circles?
[3:10:56] Praetor_GG: poor zac trying to do grubs PepeLaugh
[3:11:02] Wild761: his passive just came up
[3:11:20] miami_shark: haha passive CAME
[3:11:23] miami_shark: CAME
[3:11:37] lpg100: WeirdDude @miami_shark
[3:11:47] smartasspawn: @juulripper_ how do you determine that you play perfect every game?
[3:11:48] prinyz: Terrible build
[3:12:02] noonifer: Santorin doesnt like dieing. Good to know.
[3:12:05] juulripper_: @smartasspawn I said almost.
[3:12:48] antisuji: people don't understand a lot of champions. I've had people leash when I'm ivern...
[3:12:51] smartasspawn: still, how do you do it? genuinely wondering
[3:13:08] motorboater2: this guy deserves to be timed out
[3:13:09] noonifer: What about AP ?
[3:13:14] lpg100: ppl dont understand to aggro swap when you R no, ive died plenty of times cause i get reaggro when i do damage with R
[3:13:23] juulripper_: @smartasspawn 10 cs per minute, mvp every game on opgg, most damage, most damage taken, and most KP
[3:13:29] noonifer: Sniper reksai thoughhhh
[3:14:00] Arisutra: what about shurelya's rek'sai to pay respect to that chef voli from before?
[3:14:30] smartasspawn: @juulripper_ wow never seen that stuck on almost any mmr. hope you overcome that team luck
[3:14:48] ZoneArch: @juulripper_ holy shit youre cracked bro, unlucky Riot must have you on their list
[3:15:11] juulripper_: @smartasspawn I lied hella I’m grandmaster ❤️
[3:15:43] smartasspawn: who isn't at this point
[3:15:57] antisuji: shurelya's velkoz?
[3:17:04] noonifer: its my world, everyone else is just in it. right npcs chatters?
[3:18:21] nwa4lifeTV: u need to kill it to proc
[3:18:24] smartasspawn: is it the first one spawned after 20?
[3:18:25] noonifer: does jungle have to?
[3:18:30] Wild761: first red buff spawn after baron
[3:18:30] Mawolfman: it spawned before 20
[3:18:38] noonifer: LOL
[3:18:39] noonifer: bm
[3:18:39] nwa4lifeTV: coz its the old red buff
[3:18:55] TheTrakker: there is some weird stuff about that Shruge
[3:19:09] smartasspawn: maybe it started gitting before 20 and it didnt transform
[3:19:46] smartasspawn: thats the maximum wind bro move

[4:53:55] Nullan: @Praetor_GG no I played from game release for a bout 5 years then took a huge break.
[4:54:15] Praetor_GG: @Nullan roaming support has been the meta for a while, at least since they added passive gold support items
[4:54:17] Dezrunner: 0 ping is literally Riot employee in the building
[4:54:23] lewhitehd69: if i had 0 ping i would be rank1 COPIUM
[4:54:30] paramedicclark: what up santorin, wanna say thanks for the entertainment.been watching you since LCS EU days
[4:54:43] paramedicclark: not a link just fat fingers lol
[4:54:52] Praetor_GG: @Praetor_GG you need to use the passive gold to play the map, help your win condition
[4:55:01] Nullan: @Praetor_GG Got it, I guess I am just depeding on each lane to do their own jobs. I will try roaming
[4:55:05] BennyBerserker: @Santorin what would you rank the jg role atm 1-5 where 5 is least impactful?
[4:55:13] hernameisunforgetable: oih thats a link alright
[4:55:46] lardyparty: oh no it's doomed

[4:56:16] YoungTheis: Red buff added time
[4:56:23] KoiTris: @Nullan I suggest following "stunt" on twitch, challenger ex pro support main. Super good vibe streams and really helped me learn support from g1 to diamond 2
[4:56:26] YoungTheis: or did he have red
[4:56:33] hey_im_rabid: Why does that Vi skin have Cloud hair?

[5:06:22] iiNumb3rz: It's like you have played this champ before
[5:06:33] lewhitehd69: why armut playing on EU i thought he was NA
[5:07:48] iiNumb3rz: I had to tune out earlier so I didn't see if you answered but is 3:17 full clear good on viego or could I still shave time off? I can't seem to grt lower.

[5:09:46] iiNumb3rz: I have a friend who is bronze 3 seasons in a row and hasn't bought a single control ward in over 100 games this season.
[5:10:04] tugwos: Just think, if he bought control wards he could be iron
[5:10:04] lardyparty: holy shit it's only 17 mins in??

[5:13:41] lardyparty: armut oh shit forgot about him
[5:14:01] iiNumb3rz: You're running it down and my running it down are two different things.
[5:14:38] RaiohKyros: pot diff
[5:14:40] jakubpacko25: you had 0/3/4 at the start since then you have 9/0/10 man really nice bounce back
[5:15:29] iiNumb3rz: You're doing so much damage for not be hob too. Kind of crazy.

[5:22:44] RaiohKyros: did you see the long ass guide written on aphelios? i'm wondering how many pros (not adc) have never bothered to read champions in detail
[5:22:49] PapaJasonHS: bruh red kayn seems kinda busted after buffs
[5:22:55] koushik_10: bro u remember how i told i role swap to mid and won 5 in a row i went back to jgl and i get all losing lanes it is so disgusting
[5:22:59] NightShado81: @chat did i miss the reksai games?
[5:23:16] RaiohKyros: ahhh yeah that's what i'm thinking
[5:23:24] RaiohKyros: it helps to have adc main in the same room
[5:23:32] williamcoe22: just jumped on stream, is rek sai playable now?
[5:23:37] policx: don't play kayn
[5:23:40] policx: lol
[5:23:41] NightShado81: is reksai the queen back or still dead?
[5:24:16] Virbello: man i started trying to actively push ranked this year, got happy because my adc was like 1k lp chall last year...then he was hard stuck masters ~100lp across 300 games this year LOL

[5:25:49] Virbello: does she get aoe knockup again?
[5:25:50] lardyparty: since when is lilia shit?!
[5:26:00] Obeez: i thought lilia was a good jungler
[5:26:12] NightShado81: @Santorin but why play reksai when volibear just does it better and is tankier like legit she doesn't even have dmg anymore?
[5:26:16] lackmind9: Why is lilia so long?
[5:26:24] lackmind9: *so low
[5:26:47] lackmind9: Nothing?
[5:26:49] Virbello: really small sample size there right
[5:26:55] lol_levart: passive nerfed

[5:28:54] lauk1337: its a skill problem
[5:29:12] cyberdefender9: a lee sin master class?

[5:29:31] IamDreamShot: lidalee lurfs

[5:33:27] Bradabing: tbf that probably woulda worked against anyone but santorin
[5:33:28] NachoLazer_: winners q
