[0:14:41] ericaborgest: hello friends kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[0:14:43] Niomah: It definitely sucks. I got divorced after 17 years of marriage so believe me. When they start making excuses to not be with you, walk away, because you are worth better than that
[0:14:47] via_trita: I'm sorry to hear it, but at the end of the day, if you say "we can work through it and talk through it" and they aren't immediately like "yes and I agree" there is too much of a maturity difference that will bring up even more problems in the future. from personal experience. dont force it, if its meant to be, you'll get back together in the future
[0:15:18] lilsuru_: I somehow got here right on time for the advice
[0:15:25] Kamii96: Hello and good day! :D

[0:19:31] atichii: lmao
[0:19:39] via_trita: Vex Passive damage increased. E and passive interaction adjusted.   Vex doesn’t quite have the damage she needs to chain together multikills like she could last season, so we’re amping her damage when played as an anti-mobility mage.  Passive - Doom ‘n Gloom Gloom Detonation Damage: 30-140 (based on level) (+20% AP) ⇒ 40-150 (based on level) (+25% AP) E - Looming Darkness newKilling units with Looming Darkness now grants Doom ‘n Gloom's passive refund.

[0:54:59] Teekwan: @mark__yeahhh new patch changed the font
[0:55:35] ragtimediddly: woah wait

[0:55:53] osvaldo96s: hellouu kaypea, hope you are having a good day
[0:56:07] jexuzd: Got buffed on farming, nerfed on damage
[0:56:08] cymatics_crystal: it did YEP
[0:56:30] jzipfel20: Per Lucas, the brand changes was still a slight nerf
[0:57:02] ragtimediddly: oh Kayn got another buff as well
[0:57:15] Teekwan: I'm not on X, but i wanted to look up the post. Why is your age the first on auto suggest when i typed your name?
[0:57:22] Eternal_Weazel: They nerfed Brands ult dmg but they buffed his clearing speed in jgl
[0:57:26] jexuzd: Yeah, red kayn heals for more
[0:57:31] ragtimediddly: because yunno... being able to 100-0 3 champs instantly as blue Kayn is fine...
[0:57:33] J_to_the_jf: it also sucks your w procts as an attack
[0:57:41] fraternityy: do you have auto attack on??

[0:58:40] emberl1n: i think there's a think in the settings that make it so that ou automatically attack someone that is activated normally, but idk if that is the one that can fix that
[0:58:43] jzipfel20: I thought it was just a red kayn buff and not blue form
[0:59:10] ragtimediddly: red got a buff because blue is busted
[0:59:23] Darkcyter: @SickeningTouchLoL kaypHello

[1:06:45] tim_the_cake: without heartsteel the damage would be same. He has bork and bork does more damage to tanks
[1:06:54] tinyyy912: FUN
[1:07:00] mark__yeahhh: just enjoy your pretty skins thats fun too
[1:07:12] ElminstersGhost: Hi

[1:08:43] Evisamora: lux with heartsteel? Is it new?
[1:09:52] Evisamora: I mean, if you don't try it, you wouldn't know@
[1:11:06] lewhitehd69: @KayPea wat was the question? kaypNoted

[1:11:57] Evisamora: The dream Tim
[1:12:07] jimbob_ywert: my ping is 130 😭
[1:12:26] lewhitehd69: according to internets bork does 12% of targets current HP on attacks so yh more hp = more dmg ratirlGraph
[1:12:34] The_KungFro: yeah but he also mostly hit you with spells that time, and bork is current health damage and you were already under half
[1:12:48] glyndev: The heartsteel still saved you. Yone deals damage from sources other than the bork passive and the heartsteel helps with that
[1:12:53] Evisamora: join the darkside Kp, do it. Go 0/10 yas and flash your masteries kaypCheer
[1:12:58] The_KungFro: I agree that the health saved you in that instance, tho if you were higher bork would have still gotten you low
[1:13:31] luxisbrokenn: ngl heatsteel feels not so valiu
[1:13:55] ragtimediddly: Stop bodyshaming Lux and her phat health pool
[1:13:58] an_lyze: I dont know the items anymore so I can't say. Does Hearsteel give armor at least?

[1:28:17] Nightbot: kaypLurk
[1:28:21] lilCACTUSS9: I like it with quick cast (or whatever it's called) so I can see the hitbox to be more precise with minions and get more stacks
[1:28:22] LaXx3: How Is that you have different name in lobby And game
[1:28:24] CynicalScrub: hence the " "'s around new :)

[1:32:21] lilCACTUSS9: What happened? I'd like to see that from Hwei's point of view
[1:32:23] JustCaptainMimmy: reee
[1:32:33] The_KungFro: did he have a pot?
[1:32:33] CynicalScrub: haha yeah, i just assumed you'd be greedy for the stack
[1:32:54] ragtimediddly: Simply don't miss the skillshot Kappa
[1:33:03] Vladpopvv: maybe he leveled up?
[1:33:05] Hymuno: simply auto attack harder Kappa
[1:33:10] ataraxia78: he had a pot
[1:33:13] CynicalScrub: see, play a new champ and they give you a game that's impossible to lose
[1:33:14] lilCACTUSS9: With or without red buff, it should have killed him. An auto was more than enough at this level
[1:33:16] shedfirekid1: least leona got it
[1:33:33] JustCaptainMimmy: happend i guess
[1:34:03] shedfirekid1: who needs cannons?

[1:44:38] Hymuno: its so annoying that you have to left click once you enter otherwise you just 180 and faceplant into a wall
[1:44:42] JustCaptainMimmy: @MarcoKast you welcome ^^
[1:44:58] jexuzd: I havent use it but i heard it has to be clicked the direction

[1:46:50] via_trita: KP are you re-clicking while channeling into rift herald?
[1:47:16] Darkcyter: It's a onesie? A new one right?
[1:47:26] via_trita: you should be, it decides the start direction
[1:47:38] Hymuno: yeah if you don't click you just 180 for some reason
[1:47:39] Darkcyter: Oh you mean Veigar FailFish
[1:47:47] KinKaray: And you guys didn't know, we have the Irish voice actor for Malphite! KayPea is the best Malphite impersonator on that side of the pond! KEKW
[1:47:50] RaynKire: @via_trita I did not know this. Just a right click when you have the direction set then?
[1:48:13] via_trita: if you dont click, you auto go in the direction of the way you were facing when channeling

[1:49:16] Niomah: on just them
[1:49:19] Niomah: I think
[1:49:21] CynicalScrub: do you guys remember the veigar who got 25,000 stacks and could 1-shot baron?
[1:49:29] Niomah: If they die before the time is up I think it does AOE damage
[1:49:51] lilCACTUSS9: Hwei would be half as frustrating without that big orange dmg/second path ability
[1:50:03] cleishijin: KAYPEAAAA I MISSED U

[1:51:13] RaynKire: @via_trita Agreed!
[1:51:28] CynicalScrub: tank veigar will be a thing again since he doesn't necessarily need to build AP items to do dmg
[1:51:40] xBoomShotBaby: this makes me wanna play Veigar
[1:51:55] christianfr9: good evening!
[1:52:06] RaynKire: Does deathcap bonus AP apply to AP gained from his stacks?

[2:10:26] CheeseHead1337: Can the muse be connected to multiple PCs at once? I like using 1 mouse and swapping between work and personal pc with just pushing the selector button
[2:10:31] alexdefoeahri: @Lergaze EDG zoe, its a team skin that won championship at one point
[2:10:33] Niomah: I hate playing against Zoe with the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns

[2:12:03] Kunafish: is it better to withhold the darkmatter skill?
[2:12:40] Niomah: I usually build a lot of haste on Veigar so I can Q waves more efficiently
[2:13:07] Sunnytinker: wait!? how can you request to fist bump certain people?
[2:13:11] Niomah: for stackses
[2:13:35] Niomah: mostly because we do less damage to minions in ARAM
[2:13:36] via_trita: @Sunnytinker you can't its a general request to the team
[2:13:55] Niomah: I think you just see who initiated it
[2:13:59] MizeraHitara: LenaAlohaa LenaAlohaa

[2:15:27] via_trita: @alexdefoeahri right, but its not to a specific person, its to the entire team
[2:15:29] Sunnytinker: good stacks i believe is like 10 or 11 stacks per min
[2:15:30] Niomah: I can't really tell because I only ARAM
[2:15:40] Niomah: where you can hit 5 champs with abils on the regular
[2:15:55] alexdefoeahri: @via_trita yeah that it is not, anyone can react upon it

[2:37:20] animesupremee: Ohhh! Did you play Veigar? I was Zoe. I found your youtube years ago and you inspired me to play mid and I thought I might of played against you last game and saw you online!
[2:37:22] impaktfull: but plat games harder than dia
[2:37:24] impaktfull: like wtf
[2:37:27] Nullan: I play support, I am not exaggerating I win lane every single game. But every single game, mid or top goes 0-20 nevER FAiLS

[2:38:43] Enchantress1204: Hiiii ! You are so right about the mmr, lp etc... i have the feeling that everyone took a big slap in the face and we're almost all of us one elo under what we were last season... so frustrating😕
[2:38:48] captainperu: I agree, sometimes an account is just an L ; my main account got placed in iron 1 after 1 game and my alt account got placed in g4 after 1 game, makes no sense lol

[2:59:24] FuFuPapi_: yoo VoHiYo
[2:59:27] tinyyy912: So we are back to baning brand
[3:00:06] Jefrienaiter: He is nerfed for midlaning LUL
[3:00:10] jkkzone: people play brand in the jg now and it’s so nasty
[3:00:13] Smoothcollie: Should have known Sadge
[3:00:23] FuFuPapi_: How are those games going? kaypComfy
[3:00:30] Mathiass003: and i thought that Liandrys was not stronge
[3:01:54] Galetea: true damage still gross late
[3:01:59] NichiLune: mid brand was the highest wr mage last patch, only beaing beat by random toplaners playing mid
[3:02:00] Jaguar542: Horizon Focus?
[3:02:19] Mathiass003: Deathcap and a Void iteam could work
[3:02:26] sour_me: vex is my favourite champ rn
[3:02:26] Jefrienaiter: Forza Horizon? LUL

[3:02:49] tinyyy912: ....
[3:02:54] Systematical: I'm so glad they named the champ Hwei. I've been non-stop torturing my friends with Hwei jokes.
[3:03:06] lawfulevil_13: Vex is my inner spirit child

[3:04:36] jimbob_ywert: Brand mid has been really really good this season
[3:04:51] AvaVee: vex buffs :D
[3:04:56] exorc157: Brand was rank 6/94 in mid for emerald+ in 14.4 with 55% winrate, but less than 1% pick rate
[3:05:34] NichiLune: oh for sure
[3:05:42] Jefrienaiter: Earthquake?
[3:05:49] sovitiaisavampire: !% win rate means only 1 trick ponies are picking brand
[3:05:56] Jefrienaiter: LUL
[3:06:16] Mirpy: hey @kaypea what are your pocket picks this season?
[3:06:18] Nymphetamine12: kaypFreya kaypFreya
[3:06:24] jimbob_ywert: but wouldn’t that mean brand is really good midlane? since he’s seeing success in mid with one tricks
[3:06:44] Arisutra: my k'sante adc has a 100% winrate (in a single game of co-op v AI)

[3:12:22] Moonahris: @Darkcyter thx ^^
[3:12:39] Smoothcollie: @darkcyter Hey fam kaypHello Hope u’re doing good kaypFlower
[3:12:45] Gullbatron: Naw man it's so important. We just did our first science fair and it was wild.
[3:13:25] NichiLune: its awful
[3:14:05] Smoothcollie: U wanna tell me +15 -15 +15 -15 were golden times? kaypCaptainMaple
[3:14:13] NichiLune: yuup
[3:14:38] KinKaray: @KayPea "Welcome to Whose Line is anyway, where everything is made up and the point don't matter... League edition!"
[3:14:47] Rinniera: I just had to hard carry my team for a win just now and only got 19 lp for it, feels sooo bad
[3:15:17] joe456: what pc specs do you have @KayPea
[3:15:34] Rinniera: Im at -30 lp for a loss right now :D
[3:15:34] dalig_: - 33 lp Kappa
[3:15:39] dalig_: + 22 lp
[3:15:46] Jefrienaiter: Kay, do you know the dutch version of KP?
[3:16:07] Sammguy: Sammguy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 69 months, currently on a 64 month streak! Niiiice
[3:16:11] Rinniera: Yeah my WR is 49% which isnt great but not that bad??
[3:16:21] Darkcyter: @Sammguy kaypHYPERS WB
[3:16:25] jkkzone: @rinniera same thing happening to me :(
[3:16:27] Jefrienaiter: Maybe you wanna Google Knol power then. I think its funny
[3:16:33] Leonxzo: I had a small winning streak and then i lost 15 in a row and i dipped this game cuz theres no way. I had a 65% wr
[3:16:39] Jefrienaiter: 'knolpower'
[3:16:46] Jaguar542: Some Chogath? Chogath and Orianna is your season 14 highest winrate
[3:17:04] Arisutra: everything feels so "tight" right now (can't think of another word to describe it) that one player just deciding they cba is back-breaking
[3:17:09] Sammguy: doing well. Here's to hoping you go on a win streak soon
[3:17:13] LonaLuxe: at one point i was losing 37 and gaining 15 it was so bad
[3:17:13] shedfirekid1: @Leonxzo same exact for me
[3:17:17] Rinniera: Im at like 200 games played this season which is yikes lol but I keep climbing then demoting and rinse and repeat
[3:17:18] Sammguy: Hi Darkcyter
[3:17:59] animesupremee: @Rinniera I think statistically 50% +/- 2.5% is the goal of matchmaking. They want you to get to an ELO that is as close to a 50% winrate as possible but I don't disagree with what KP is saying.
[3:18:08] clutchammons: i gain 19-22 and lose no less then 26plus everytime
[3:18:11] theLevya: just like life
[3:18:20] clutchammons: nd i dont think i have more then 80 game splayed
[3:18:40] Jaguar542: I don't need a GF. Lol matchmaking f**Ks me every game kaypLUL kaypWHAT
[3:18:52] lol_whiisp: I was having +16 -24 in d4 with 54%wr, demoted, now I'm back d4 with around +20-20 with 51%wr make it make sense lol
[3:18:56] Jefrienaiter: @jaguar542 KEKW
[3:18:58] emberl1n: this season i dropped from plat 2 to gold2 and i gain 22lp and loose 28 and 30 lp
[3:19:03] clutchammons: yeah ill never get out of iron/bronze and ive just accpeted that
[3:19:03] berk2raan: 709 people🧐
[3:19:12] ballzagna1: i have 48%, lose 32lp win 22-24lp when i wrote riot they said thats intended
[3:19:15] berk2raan: HELLO
[3:19:22] booty_slurp: @emberl1n same happened to me
[3:19:25] jimbob_ywert: I’m hard stuck gold 3 it sucks
[3:19:30] djoesa03: I always wonder if riot games employees actuaaly play the game. or lf they are staying in their ivory tower :(
[3:19:30] lol_whiisp: Ever since emerald was added it's been ridiculous
[3:19:38] kalpaf: hey grl <3 Pog
[3:19:47] animesupremee: It feels like this game punishes you for trying to become a better player. If I 1 trick I win a lot more but they keep putting worse teammates so if my 1 trick is banned or picked by other team I still am expected to win with worse teammates.
[3:19:54] Jefrienaiter: Ahri on your watch?
[3:19:55] sunde2: true
[3:19:59] joonmoon: just show us MMR instead of this lp rank bs
[3:20:03] via_trita: prediction!
[3:20:04] kalpaf: how's grinding today
[3:20:19] Smoothcollie: I can play only like every second or third weekend. I look at the pc and think: I’m too tired for the shit, fck it. And so glad I think this, cuz the game truly looks faked

[3:20:31] Smoothcollie: fcked
[3:20:32] Sammguy: first death prediction? or number to total daths maybe?
[3:20:42] MarcoKast: what the flying fuck why do i gotta sub again
