[3:22:55] 514484: it's like the support item
[3:22:57] Sietaha: Jungle item nerfs lane gold so junglers don't farm lanes, however, ivern can make the gold up pretty easy
[3:23:11] masoku322: @Sietaha ohhh
[3:23:12] 514484: just play roam like bardinette EZ

[5:15:00] Tr1ggaEuw: what is with shadowflame should be good right
[5:15:14] twitchsuckstoday: deathcap better for burst auto and Q
[5:15:20] Tr1ggaEuw: shadowflame just buffs the damage itself and has magic pen
[5:15:25] matheusgusmao00: is assassin teemo good? Lich bane and shadowflame?
[5:16:59] twitchsuckstoday: absoultely nothing.
[5:17:43] Tr1ggaEuw: hahaha
[5:17:45] Tr1ggaEuw: true
[5:17:53] matheusgusmao00: and they need to be low hp
[5:20:07] Tr1ggaEuw: is rageblade important in the build
[5:20:53] matheusgusmao00: i've seen zwagmo building cracken slayer second
[5:21:03] twitchsuckstoday: by alot? hmm i doubt it after 4 autos
[5:21:07] Tr1ggaEuw: y when it is stacked its op
[5:21:13] pikapika_666_: In australian "ringer" means "fast sheep shearer".
[5:22:00] maymihai: vs tank Void ?
[5:23:15] cutehubert: Ipav does ROA is good on teemo
[5:23:18] maymihai: teemo tank core item ?
[5:23:32] cutehubert: okok
[5:23:59] Cosmikator: is terminus more consistent in aa since kraken only every 3rd hit procs?
[5:24:49] twitchsuckstoday: @Cosmikator kraken  doesn't proc on auto attack 6 with rageblade, its delayed to 8
[5:25:07] Cosmikator: ye
[5:25:28] twitchsuckstoday: *doesnt proc twice
[5:27:22] pikapika_666_: no vampire werewolf hybrid :(
[5:27:52] Cosmikator: @twitchsuckstoday csing gets difficult when aa's doing random dmg so i always avoid inconsistent items
[5:28:30] ayentaken13: Best teemo ever   hellooooo <3 <3
[5:29:42] twitchsuckstoday: @Cosmikator I think ipav could proxy teemo a little bit.
[5:30:29] Cosmikator: @twitchsuckstoday proxying like singed/garen?
[5:30:34] cutehubert: I was talking abour ROA cause Artuhur Lanches use it sometimes
[5:30:46] 514484: PogBones
[5:30:52] 514484: epic RoA meme
[5:31:00] twitchsuckstoday: Not as much as those champs but when jungler not around.
[5:31:04] 514484: start mana crystal for added disrespect
[5:31:20] twitchsuckstoday: Mana crystal is marked up pricing. Mana is not worth alot
[5:31:30] 514484: tht's not the point
[5:31:39] 514484: the point is lowering the cost on first back
[5:31:43] 514484: ofc it's trash
[5:32:04] 514484: you forgo early to have a cheap buy, it's great on lsot chapter rushers
[5:32:11] Cosmikator: @twitchsuckstoday seems a rare case since midlaners can roam with high mobility
[5:32:44] twitchsuckstoday: Which bush is teemo gonna be in? proxy and RUN
[5:33:37] Cosmikator: @twitchsuckstoday easy to counter - just ward top jgl ipavHmm
[5:34:21] twitchsuckstoday: its not a meta. Something unique he can do.
