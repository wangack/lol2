[5:53:27] nearquaad: @Shonkers__ i'm pretty sure it's called rage and builds up as she attacks (but i'm not a shyv player so i might be misremembering)
[5:53:41] bahumat989: yeah, shyvanna has cooldowns and a rage meter
[5:54:22] Shonkers__: what does rage do?
[5:54:34] Shonkers__: let her do that i assume
[5:54:42] Horroar: use her ult
[5:54:49] Horroar: aka go big dragon
[5:56:41] Shonkers__: i do not play league at all, so i thank you all for the info
[5:56:56] Shonkers__: i just like watching the numbers fall off things
[5:57:38] nearquaad: np shonkers! it's a very fun game but it has a lot going on
[5:58:18] nearquaad: OML that camille ult kaifW
[5:58:20] Shonkers__: it looks fun

[6:02:49] ShieaTV: how often do you guys run into higher rank people who ruin their ranks to play in iron
[6:06:11] TDesius: Baby Dragon without a Time Wizard but with an Elder Dragon is pretty busted LUL
[6:06:59] Valid_JarJar: kaif you know the hitman developers are creating an rpg if not look up project dragon/fantasy
[6:07:55] TheMasterBadger: Is it an actual RPG or an ARPG?
[6:08:48] Shonkers__: well there goes the youtube vod
[6:08:57] Valid_JarJar: itâ€™s described a connected world rpg
[6:09:09] Valid_JarJar: as a*
[6:09:34] ShieaTV: damn did they buff smolder? ._.
[6:09:55] TDesius: LUL
[6:09:57] TheMasterBadger: He is insanely busted right now
[6:10:00] Fenzha: probably wasnt the best time for 2 of you to go lick the walls of the enemy base
[6:10:10] TDesius: Kaif is currently procressing that loss LUL

[6:19:40] Valid_JarJar: has anyone ever heard of the gray whale
[6:20:51] Valid_JarJar: it was assumed to be extinct for over 200 years but on was seen off the coast
[6:21:51] nillasprite: league sure do be hitting different these days
[6:21:54] Valid_JarJar: of Massachusetts
[6:22:29] nearquaad: FeelsBadMan
[6:22:35] IluRin: that will hurt the soul
[6:22:44] nearquaad: we've all been there though
[6:22:54] nillasprite: he's clearly scripting, only explanation that he dodged that Q
[6:24:17] nillasprite: it's not looking good for our heros
[6:24:43] Shonkers__: it hasn't been looking good for many games now
[6:25:50] nillasprite: go next? lmao
[6:26:41] lordasriel2: yall should try some balls to the wall comp and see if you can confuse your way to a win
[6:27:23] TDesius: I personally think Surrender should be removed from the game, and it turn into a 30+ Minute Forfeit for games that are just excessively in enemy favour at the 30+ Minute Marker. People try to surrender way too quickly and just stop playing properly
[6:28:41] lordasriel2: @TDesius one thing i like about heroes of the storm is that you can't forfeit, unfortunately throwing is still possible
[6:29:15] Valid_JarJar: just saw what it looks like to have a turkey go through a windshield
[6:29:41] nillasprite: @TDesius any time you take away agency/choice from a player in games like this usually feels like a bad idea IMO
[6:29:46] TDesius: Surrender/Forfeit ain't bad for certain instances, but I've had games where someone dies, and then just wanted to surrender the second the vote is available after one death. If they remove it or extend it people are less likely to waste 30+ Minutes etc.
[6:29:59] TDesius: DotA didn't have surrender. Nilla. Neither should LoL
[6:30:24] TDesius: People try to quit too quickly is my issue with this game.
[6:30:45] nillasprite: I mean you can't acount for people's mental is the problem
[6:31:11] nillasprite: you take away forfeit at this point and people will just throw harder to get out and it would cause an entire different set of issues.
[6:31:47] TDesius: I just personally think that surrender shouldn't be in the game. If someone throws intentionally its very obvious in those cases.
[6:31:55] TDesius: But the whole "FF at 15" is Toxic in itself
[6:32:37] lordasriel2: there'd be some growing pains as people get used to the lack of forfeit, but once that's over things should calm down
[6:32:48] nillasprite: I can agree that early surrender was a dumb decision but I think overall it's fine to have the option
[6:33:51] nillasprite: Pentas are earned not given
[6:34:15] MoonCapri: did FF at 15 come up because everybody was aiming for snowballing into a win before the 30 minutes mark? I vaguely remember thatâ€™s a thing in recent seasons
[6:34:56] zepidreus: Mundo gives no fucks
[6:34:59] ahmya49: ahmya49 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[6:35:09] nillasprite: @MoonCapri no "FF at X" has always been a thing. it's just 15 is when you can early vote
[6:35:48] TDesius: I like DotA's no Surrender cause people will play until the games over, rather than go "Well I can just surrender soon"
[6:36:03] MoonCapri: Ah gotcha. Thanks for the info @nillasprite
[6:36:07] TDesius: Most people anyway
[6:37:34] nillasprite: @TDesius I think there are more factors to it than just the ability or not to surrender, and that's also only your experience as a player. it's hard to say what it is like for the player base as a whole.
[6:39:32] nillasprite: Sazar with the magma hot takes as usual
[6:39:32] KuruTurtle: @TDesius @TDesius Well in Dota 2, at least last I played it, people can just leave and quit the game, ofc this will punish them but that didn't really stop people from doing it when I tried to get into Dota
[6:39:47] MoonCapri: wish they have a mini game thatâ€™ll let me play something instead of waiting for respawn timers
[6:40:21] nillasprite: @MoonCapri you'd have people throwing to play the mini game if that was the case
[6:40:27] MoonCapri: like Dino run in league when Iâ€™m dead, then I just pop back in so I can endure the long death timers lol
[6:40:43] MoonCapri: thatâ€™s a good point, nilla
[6:41:33] zepidreus: Da Feet
[6:41:34] nillasprite: now hear me out Kaif. Gragas jungle.
[6:43:45] nillasprite: wait is Riots new champion broken? That's such a wild and new concept
[6:44:13] MightyW0x: Yes smolder is broken
[6:44:32] nillasprite: I'm shocked and suprised

[6:53:32] CammyBiz: is this game fun?
[6:53:47] Shonkers__: if you like CBT, yes this game is fun
[6:53:57] nillasprite: @CammyBiz no, it's a trap
[6:54:57] CammyBiz: haha fair answers both of them
[6:55:15] Shonkers__: sazar needs a mod that makes his second screen the mini map
[6:56:06] Shonkers__: how do you cheat in league? god mode?
[6:56:42] DrSaton: It is simillar to aimbot
[6:56:54] Shonkers__: i see i see
[6:57:07] nillasprite: i'm sorry, what the fuck are those
[6:57:48] nillasprite: did they get rid of rift herald?
[6:58:32] nillasprite: it wouldn't be a game with Sazar if he didn't do something incredibly questionable
[6:59:35] knaring: she wanted ur skutle c:
[6:59:38] DobzDaDude: Oh, I just noticed that I got a sub! Cheers to whoever sent it out!
[6:59:38] Shonkers__: she wasn't aiming that e
[6:59:46] DrSaton: What program do you use to show viewers from twitch and yt?
[7:00:42] knaring: Well i didnt say she was good at aimming now did i?
[7:03:00] zepidreus: Fidd-ell in the Mid-ell
