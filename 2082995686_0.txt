[3:03:19] filips322: In low elo it's easy to play against ranged... I went 15/0 on a vayne top
[3:03:21] BATU2306: aatrox is a bruiser. even though he has ranged abilities, he literally stops while using his q which makes him slow enough not to be considered as ranged
[3:03:24] Pplek: is gnar ranged by your standards ?

[4:26:54] 0yasserooo0: @StDingus yeah it's good
[4:26:58] Azelyth: @Alumynati sundered sky doesnt work with lethality, each one wants to do one thing and they dont mash together
[4:27:11] elephantworld: It's just shitty meta for aatrox rn
[4:27:12] levislamp: @StDingus it would have been cool if it did though
[4:27:23] pidgeon35: yea
[4:27:28] Azelyth: @blasphemat he was design to be a jungler, but can be played support i think

[4:31:46] Azelyth: @ILeocard yes everyone has been saying that since they changed ghost
[4:31:52] BroSam__: Rioters don't play top lane, they do not understand our pain of going against ghosting ranged all the time
[4:31:53] baddecisiondanx: @Naayil hope you are having a good day with some good games
[4:32:18] StDingus: fucking lave a bitta brizzy

[4:32:58] yassine5481: 404 games not found
[4:33:01] BroSam__: Best way to balance top lane: Make all the stupid ranged shit no longer even choosable if the person is placed in top lane (kinda joking idk)
[4:33:05] manuwu69: making ranged autos deal 80% reduced dmg would make toplane balanced frfr
[4:33:34] amigos113e: We need more bans

[4:34:11] Gyno361: Hey
[4:34:12] khlori: Cass just overall needs to be destroyed with nerf hammer, that champ is disgusting

[4:34:19] feskxd: 6-7
[4:34:20] jo_ffs: 5
[4:34:28] dimertime43: It's 10 health per lvl
[4:34:29] BroSam__: @eSkeggi That's basically what I just suggested, I feel like people would be mad but it would get all this ranged crap out of top lane
[4:34:32] amigos113e: 7
[4:34:33] jo_ffs: :)
[4:34:38] blasphemat: 8.2

[4:36:07] BroSam__: @eSkeggi Perhaps, but there would be a lot of Vayne and TF top abusers whining at Riot about it
[4:36:17] Azelyth: @LaikaStretch_ its a wig
[4:36:21] khlori: Remember when they nerfed second wind and dorans shield because these countered ranged top too hard? Yeah
[4:36:26] khlori: they want top to be fucked
[4:36:32] gennaatrox: helo
[4:37:05] baddecisiondanx: plz fix w riot
[4:37:07] i9nine9i: @Naayil what's the best role to carry rn?
[4:37:17] Yujibro: @i9nine9i jng
[4:37:22] baddecisiondanx: jg
[4:37:33] last_hakira: can u carry as supp?
[4:37:34] mintaras_: u did not say adc XDD
[4:37:38] dimertime43: Adc is dogshit no?
[4:37:39] last_hakira: z
[4:37:41] Aargul: they nerfed ds and sw because of teemo and kennen after they buffed teemo and kennen ...
[4:37:44] jo_ffs: top if u play good champs (ranged)
[4:37:48] i9nine9i: yeah i tought adc or jg
[4:37:51] mata12q: Ok
[4:37:52] khlori: in high elo support, you roam and gank like jungler but dont have to farm
[4:37:57] manuwu69: second wind dshield was insane on akali, she was legit unkillable early
[4:37:59] khlori: (but only high elo so adc wont rage quit)
[4:38:04] mintaras_: neitehr role can carry all roles have 50% winrate so it doesnt matter which role you play
[4:38:22] manuwu69: @mintaras_ Clueless
[4:38:38] mintaras_: @manuwu69 how is that clueless ?
[4:38:42] Azelyth: aatrox its garbage level 1, and 2, and 3 too, dont forget level 4, also 5 6 7 8, 9 its decent
[4:38:46] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[4:38:53] last_hakira: oh well there's nothing we can do about it
[4:39:05] Anfraak: Wukong armor buff
[4:39:07] Anfraak: xdd
[4:39:44] last_hakira: wait until level 5 and fight
[4:40:04] Aargul: hes full stacks of passive instantly
[4:40:05] manuwu69: @mintaras_ is easier to carry and win being a jg or a adc, even if your team only barks and oinks
[4:40:27] mintaras_: @manuwu69 well yes but no
[4:40:33] baddecisiondanx: especially because 99% of games aatrox get's weaksided
[4:40:45] mintaras_: and adc is deffinetly not good to carry except high elo which none of us are tbh
[4:40:54] last_hakira: lmao
[4:41:10] last_hakira: overextended and still no jungler
[4:41:42] winchester_d3an: why lethality
[4:41:51] baddecisiondanx: braver than me. i woulda longsword cloth armor and boots lol
[4:41:56] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[4:42:02] winchester_d3an: didnt video title on yt said lethality on aatrox sucks
[4:42:06] manuwu69: even if roles have statistically 50% wr, jg is still very strong and can solo carry, adc can solo carry if you have a very mobile champ like tristana (w), ezreal (tanky + w) and samira (heals a lot)
[4:42:23] pidgeon35: XD
[4:42:27] baddecisiondanx: @winchester_d3an this is also bruiser path lol
[4:42:29] Trvka: xdddd
[4:42:31] Anfraak: Good observation
[4:42:41] dimertime43: Why is it good in pro play
[4:42:44] mintaras_: @manuwu69 yea i do agree with this one statiscally none of the roles carry but logically they do and yea only some adc champs can carry not all fo them
[4:42:45] winchester_d3an: why profane then
[4:42:47] Anfraak: vs Renek is tabi rush??
[4:42:52] khlori: Wukong
[4:42:53] BroSam__: Wukong annoying af
[4:43:09] khlori: Wukong's clone being free heal for Aa peepoLove
[4:43:14] last_hakira: you canceled that R animation or what? that was kinda clean
[4:43:35] blubymeko: starscreen isn't a great laner anyways

[4:44:06] blubymeko: i remember his TCL days, he would just pick a tank and chill ''for the team'' xdd
[4:44:21] hasan7v7: Doran‚Äôs blade worth taking in melee matchups?
[4:44:24] hughhh_g_rection181: what country is this
[4:44:31] BroSam__: Does Wukong clone give full heal for Aatrox's passive auto?
[4:44:42] pidgeon35: @BroSam__ yes
[4:44:45] manuwu69: @mintaras_ for example, an iron jg first timing lee sin would get fucked but a diamond lee sin otp can carry even if his team is like 20 kills  behind
[4:44:46] amaikeii: ye
[4:44:58] Arexbtw: does sundered sky work on wukongs clone?
[4:45:02] yassine5481: letha  ?
[4:45:08] Amaora: @Arexbtw ye
[4:45:14] amaikeii: @Arexbtw yes
[4:45:23] hughhh_g_rection181: @manuwu69 i don't agree because no one plays lee sin otp's are a myth
[4:45:27] baddecisiondanx: cloth armor doing work
[4:45:30] BroSam__: @pidgeon35 oh that's nice, this seems like a goofy matchup for Aatrox then
[4:45:45] hughhh_g_rection181: the last lee sin otp i remember is Gripex, and he disappeared
[4:45:58] DigitalEdwin: !opgg

[4:46:26] lala621: damn
[4:46:29] manuwu69: @hughhh_g_rection181 that's true, but i said as an hypothetical situation, lee sin is a very cracked 1v9er champ
[4:46:35] pidgeon35: based
[4:46:36] hughhh_g_rection181: @DoggoTheGabe bills who? bills eyelish? bills gate? what bills

[4:46:59] mustybrain: its basketball
[4:47:02] darthveigar92: Is tp better than ignkte
[4:47:04] manuwu69: @hughhh_g_rection181 fair enough
[4:47:14] manuwu69: @darthveigar92 yes
[4:47:29] GetPaved: it reminds of me the craze in the US where fukboys would wear bulls merch and not know 1 player on the starting lineuup
[4:47:43] hughhh_g_rection181: Naayil with a buzz cuz would look so alpha (do it Naayil)

[4:51:09] ako225: 1v3 wukong
[4:51:23] khlori: Damn he got AVENGERS 'd
[4:51:30] xthenyy: Look at wukong's armor when passive stacked
[4:51:31] manuwu69: this matchup is very onesided, even if you werent going lethality
[4:51:32] yassine5481: when did u start going pf hydra
[4:51:41] yassine5481: how far have u fallen :D

[5:00:20] Aitortita: @ImRamaCabr0 I feel like the question "isn't it better" is literally because they want to hear naayil opinion and learn from him, not bc they want to argue which is better xd

[5:16:36] 4eVeR_jc: i do 10mins before training and 10 after training Û†ÄÄ
[5:16:38] DigitalEdwin: you dont need to do run, just do high incline

[5:17:06] snadizzzs: Bulk season
[5:17:08] LizlKun: if u do too much cardio u cant build proper muscles
[5:17:12] elephantworld: Walking is cardio
[5:17:23] songokuq8: you should be eating MEAT CHICKEN proteins in general
[5:17:36] kuubinn: ???,
[5:17:38] thekingb: run through the office
[5:17:38] GetPaved: @jegrothe3rd He just said it, he needs to eat like a pig, if he does 30 mins of cardio a day and burns 300 calories he needs to eat that 300 calories back to gain muscle
[5:17:39] Jj_gaming122: ???????

[5:18:15] kuubinn: nah they would think ure a guard or something
[5:18:19] jegrothe3rd: u have low body fat i dont think you need to do cardio
[5:18:26] jegrothe3rd: unless ur conditioning
[5:18:39] songokuq8: walking is good but you need minimum 2 hours walking to match 30 minutes of jogging

[5:19:11] Maskogre: is that a melee matchup in toplane
[5:19:13] snadizzzs: util 25%
[5:19:17] pidgeon35: i mean cardio is always good, healty, but when ur trying to bulk its just counterproductive
[5:19:24] ezergecer31: i have %7 body fat and after workout i see the  veins in my back
[5:19:28] GetPaved: He needs to bulk, and go on a calorie surplus. Cardio will make him have to eat more to gain muscle to reach that calorie surplus. Cardio is for cutting and focusing on caridovascular health
[5:19:39] ezergecer31: %12-%15 is very good
[5:19:51] snadizzzs: @ezergecer31 How much you weight?
[5:19:57] snadizzzs: Its not
[5:19:57] Yoshiiyuki: 7% sounds like he is just skin and bones
[5:20:04] ezergecer31: arround 78 kg bro
[5:20:06] stressfulllllll: single digit is fine

[5:20:14] Katan1377: ronnie coleman with negative 2 in his prime
[5:20:17] snadizzzs: You can actually live on single digit, but you need to care urself a bit

[5:22:22] gabrielwasneverhere10: grab spearshot and another friend who is his height and have them stand at your shoulders then take picture and walk around
[5:22:23] GetPaved: Muscles always increase your attractiveness , theres multiple studies on this
[5:22:23] kuubinn: how tall are u ?
[5:22:32] snadizzzs: actually desesrved for playing malphite
[5:22:33] jegrothe3rd: a good indicator is when your abs are visible for body fat
[5:22:36] stressfulllllll: im short it fine
