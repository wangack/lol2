[1:08:07] InfiniteKore: @shyammm Leona does a shit ton of damage on her passive, but she can't trigger it herself. So she needs allies to use it, correct. Makes her ganks great, but her clear and solo potential bad. AD leona works because it gives her some of that solo potential back. She just can't invest into the stats her kit wants when she does that
