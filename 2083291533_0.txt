[0:11:04] aquaticIntrovert: I only wonder if it wasn't possible to keep the latin alphanumerical characters in the same font while adding functionality to display a wider range of characters, but I suppose that is too much to ask of a minor independent company like riot games

[0:57:21] KellenExil: @quuqeli league is extremely hard and takes years to learn. Your expectation should be to lose a lot, sadly. If your friends are mad at you for struggling. they are bad friends
