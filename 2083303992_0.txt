[1:12:39] lindislitt: D-shield tabi abuser this game
[1:13:01] RexMundiDeus: Don't fight level 1. - Need to get cheater off as its super good when both tops don't have TP. - After wave crashes, if he starts Q, push the wave a little and try to establish level 2 prio, he should have to conceed as you can space him with ranged autos if he contests. - In non-TP matchups, you can E flash them when setting up a 3 wave cheater to chunk them and blow their flash potentially (we have cosmic insight).
[1:13:14] RexMundiDeus: xd tips vs darius as urgot
[1:13:21] jaxinsux: you tried vayne top again yet?
[1:14:04] lolkotek: ty for explaining its nice to know :>
[1:14:58] RexMundiDeus: - In this matchup, missing E is death. Don't hesitate to E flash even if you think normal E will hit as he can easily dodge with flash/ghost. - Slightly Darius favored until 9, but you always have solokill potential if you play properly. Generally outscale post 9/1st item but if even will come down to if you hit your E or not
[1:14:58] luanmanara: easy matchup?
[1:15:00] wasabi_ee: i dont understand wave management at all
[1:15:19] RexMundiDeus: gg
[1:15:26] chuchchuchchuch: whats your thoughts on the new font

[8:02:02] lolkotek: PokGengar vipeICANT
[8:02:03] 46chromo: lvl 30 to challenger is the most interesting
[8:02:08] Turlocklol: I come here to see the best riven out there
[8:02:08] lowros: rank 1 climb, any champ
[8:02:09] imcuteboy: What motivates you to play riven again and again? I‚Äôm getting tired of playing same champ in a couple days
[8:02:22] onlyskell: I like when you play other champs bc i dont play riven
[8:02:26] Amrro: haha sorry
[8:02:33] hamopekara: could you try heimer top
[8:02:35] aphye: i do like your kai'sa/vayne/kalista top games
[8:02:38] Amrro: i would watch
[8:02:40] inspired2495: do yone
[8:02:40] YGbabyToadx: Watching you play riven and 1v9 in late game is so cathartic
[8:02:41] k1nggggggtop: yea it's nice watching that to learn more hcamps
[8:02:41] inspired2495: unranked to chall

[8:02:52] Vacnac: @Viper why dont you try a-z 2 chall
[8:02:53] georgejasons: prefer riven
[8:02:55] Turlocklol: I prefer riven for sure
[8:02:55] zzzzzz843: i love watching ur adc top and bot ur so good at it
[8:02:56] vicoixyz: do a-z from iron 4 to chall
[8:03:02] 3251Yami: but true that Riven is fun to watch

[8:03:22] meemi1337: You're nice guy
[8:03:25] 3251Yami: i mean Riven akali Vayne is super fun to watch
[8:03:29] lowros: yeah your riven and vayne can do things that seem impossible and you pull it off every game lol
[8:03:31] k1nggggggtop: i usually enjoy the stream with music and try to learn how much pressure you put to the enemy
[8:03:38] lolkotek: for the vibesss
[8:03:38] aphye: i dont mind your adc games since it's just as entertaining as riven and you typically commentate how your playing while doing it, i like the POV commentary as you make decisions playing
[8:03:45] Umbracious: malphite volibear zac only
[8:03:47] Turlocklol: We know you can reach challenger on anything already
[8:03:48] marvel013: vayne kalista riven for me
[8:03:48] georgejasons: Poppy to challenger Kapp
[8:03:48] broterhoodd: bro how is riven in this season
[8:03:49] DillBlowBargains: yeh riven or if there‚Äôs an obvious champ that perfectly fits team comp that you also like to play
[8:03:50] Turlocklol: Its not a challenge
[8:03:50] jkrazzzy: i like just watching the mechanics
[8:03:52] lowros: also not to underestimate the significance of the tilt free commentary
[8:04:01] forbidden_pf: or duo Tf blade
[8:04:07] k1nggggggtop: i think your spacing and pressuring it's what makes you rank 1 consistenly every seasson imho
[8:04:13] lolkotek: yea pov commentary helps sooo much
[8:04:33] 3251Yami: 3
[8:04:38] 3251Yami: WOW

[8:05:31] broterhoodd: viper how is riven bro this sesason
[8:05:36] 46chromo: what's the highest winrate u've had to challenger?
[8:05:41] Kimik0z: can i redeem mundo 1v1
[8:05:46] aphye: i dont think it really matters what you play, the most enjoyable stuff to watch you do is give commentary on all your decision making, planning, and explainations on what/why you are doing what you're doing LIVE as you do it.
[8:05:47] OMGTabe: viper i win lane 9 out 10 games but i cant pressure the whole map like u, teach me SadCat
[8:05:47] 3251Yami: Nah
[8:05:50] 3251Yami: Depend

[8:05:59] vicoixyz: it‚Äôs the reason why Tarz has 3k views
[8:06:03] Kylon1235: I prefer the positivity
[8:06:05] Amrro: only when its 24/7 complaining
[8:06:10] Umbracious: depends on what streamers complain about
[8:06:12] Eowii_: complaining shows passion though
[8:06:12] lolkotek: positivity>
[8:06:14] DillBlowBargains: I don‚Äôt watch tarz for that reason
[8:06:17] Mojamsession: damn a stream within a stream within a stream
[8:06:20] 3251Yami: Depend the reason why they complaint tho
[8:06:35] Kylon1235: complaining is fine imo unless its excessive
[8:06:40] lolkotek: complaining is diff
[8:06:42] lolkotek: yeeee
[8:06:42] Kimik0z: can i redeem my mundo 1v1 geeeeeeeeeeeeee
[8:06:42] Umbracious: if youre complaining about a teammate thats griefing its understandable, but if youre complaining about every small detail it gets tiring
[8:06:44] lolkotek: hehe
[8:06:51] Kylon1235: and sometimes Viper is excessively complaining
[8:06:57] Icflr: time to play riven sup to challenger
