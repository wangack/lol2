[3:44:17] DM_MonkeyMan: Think it's highnoon

[3:47:30] Vegaskko: hello you look beautiful Mr cat on the chair

[3:47:56] Gromzzz: gragas is not useless he has mega cc and team fight ult that is potent
[3:48:32] Gromzzz: that is why i liked tank gragas better than ap carry gragas
[3:48:41] Gromzzz: tank grag applies his cc better
[3:49:47] Vegaskko: can you do scuba grahas please?
[3:50:25] Vegaskko: mind games 5Head
[3:50:29] lostx403: one might say you're the Faker of the gragas world
[3:51:32] Gromzzz: i like orn thats an ultra tanker
[3:52:04] Gromzzz: orn item thing should be removed and give him something better
[3:52:28] Gromzzz: i feel like its why he isnt played as much

[3:58:59] Vegaskko: navij he can be played either top/mid and ad/ap so it is perfect
[3:59:28] Gromzzz: nav needs to go watch a challenger stream and just write down there picks there playing meta champs for the most part
[3:59:50] Gromzzz: meta champs are what he needs to play to go up in rank
[4:00:05] NaviJ: you think? i feel like in the past theres been some nice non meta one tricks youc an climb ez with
[4:00:08] NaviJ: like eve or something

[4:24:25] metasynergy: i think auto correct changed busted to cursed lol
[4:25:26] eerrman1: sweet
[4:25:50] kidneytranspiant: hell yeah
[4:26:10] metasynergy: make a macro to type “HOOKER FIGHT!!!” in all chat
[4:27:01] metasynergy: It’s a bit unfortunate that your ADC has a Target for where to aim the hook
[4:27:07] That1locoo: MMR Diffy
[4:28:06] metasynergy: that needs to be a macro so you can spam all chat
[4:28:43] metasynergy: so he’s not a Chinese national lol
[4:28:52] TheWildLeon: I thought Taiwan was a chinese province
[4:28:55] TheWildLeon: Kappa

[4:43:50] Mykah9: i haven't seen a high ELo thresh since Biofrost played it and that game ended terriblely
[4:45:01] evilkatos: gotta not make your adc int. They're very sensative LuL
[4:51:03] That1locoo: i think the lvl 1 cheese from you corki and rengar is waht set this off.
[4:51:10] That1locoo: your corki
[4:52:15] Gromzzz: need to land a blitz pull that insta pops 1 of the enemy to win the team fight
[4:53:52] allgod: Conquerer isn't helping his burst
[4:55:07] Gromzzz: i feel like you have to make such clutch plays for your team to win the team fights
[4:57:07] metasynergy: every time you go out hooking you swear it’s the last time
[4:57:39] Jasensolo: @saintvicious wants to be a hooker confirmed on stream lol
[4:58:04] TitusGroen: LUL
[4:58:06] Jasensolo: i got $2 for ya
