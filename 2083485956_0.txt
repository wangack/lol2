[1:13:57] Zirock_: Is the McDog project skin out?
[1:13:57] facialcreamy: no yorick strategically flamed you so that you would put in more effort for his strat to save tp and use his minions to get that kill while supporting camille using maiden, which then allowed her to get three kills and stall so he could use the tp and get the dub fortnite style
[1:14:03] Rose06012: PEKW

[2:49:40] Komlin111: after thinking about the bel'
[2:49:43] truffles_avacado: It's actually just a mord bug
[2:49:50] AugustUwU: no idea, am guessing it something to do with accessibility, localization, or deprecation. Changes like that are usually pretty important
[2:49:51] towbean: its another viego bug
[2:50:04] squiddl3: its only you pekin, only your game got it
[2:50:22] Vallon14: The font allows for special characters (which is why they had it in korea first)
[2:50:24] termisaal: its so accessible now i dont even have to look at chat
[2:50:31] Komlin111: ah bel veth nerfs I think the damage reduction should be removed from her e in exchange for base hp per level and better qd with attack speed
[2:50:47] jpressie: cyrillic gaming LETSGO
[2:50:53] Komlin111: where did she go
[2:50:58] AugustUwU: @Komlin111 she'd be nonfunctional if E didn't have DR
[2:50:58] the_holc: boxbox rip

[2:51:32] jpressie: time to play so radical red
[2:51:34] dankdude179: kayle has scaled
[2:51:43] Komlin111: @AugustUwU I dont think so, if she is nothing without damage reduction she shouldnt have it.
[2:51:47] Vallon14: @augustuwu When will Illaoi get an elderwood skin please
[2:51:47] aqous: @AugustUwU can do something similar to briar e
[2:51:48] hanselthedoggo: the urgot has typed gg like 3x already
[2:51:57] Komlin111: its just gating the rest of her kit from being good
[2:52:29] AugustUwU: How would she participate in fights with more than one person without that button?
[2:52:34] towbean: this urgot is so annoying
[2:52:39] romana32: Wouldn't e having DR encourage players to go for a pick with it? otherwise she's just yi q'ing into death lmao
[2:52:41] AugustUwU: unless we want her building full tank
[2:52:47] jpressie: @Vallon14 asking the real questions
[2:52:48] romana32: even yi has DR for similar idea
[2:52:50] Komlin111: normally I go lifesteal and some hp
[2:52:55] squiddl3: at that point you are just gonna rework belveth entire kit
[2:53:06] Komlin111: ^
[2:53:14] termisaal: it must be so annoying to go to your favourite streamer bekinpoof just to chill and then get asked one million random questions youre not in charge of
[2:53:15] Trunkmak: @augustuwu just remove her ok :ok fixed
[2:53:19] i_HooX: pekin on jayce?
[2:53:24] jpressie: august owo
[2:53:39] AugustUwU: We typically give bruisers strong defensive buttons, otherwise they tend to be forced to go full tank or full lethality to function
[2:53:42] Irulaa: sad
[2:53:48] squiddl3: if you take the DR out you need to change a lot
[2:53:59] hanselthedoggo: @termisaal so true
[2:54:05] nahrmen: Chatting gg Chatting
[2:54:14] squiddl3: because standing there is part of her gameplay and her ult and q play into it

[2:57:03] hanselthedoggo: LMAO
[2:57:03] AugustUwU: we don't like when a champion can chunk you from over a screen away with a low CD poke spell. It's why we don't really let AP kog, kai'sa, or zeri be strong
[2:57:20] CovenLilith: Jayce.
[2:57:28] crunchvper: Looking jayce
[2:57:29] squiddl3: lol jayce

[2:58:13] R_a_n__: It also takes a stupid amount of mana
[2:58:15] alx70: his R just too old
[2:58:26] nuegrass: PogMaw doesn't have a passive either so needs a buff
[2:58:34] cres_cendum: Ap chogath :(
[2:58:35] Nightbot: Use !queue for the name of the queue game.
[2:58:38] KiingChocobo: didnt u play a bunch of kog sometime last year? lol
[2:58:40] termisaal: kogmaw passive ap scaling when

[2:58:52] Vallon14: @augustuwu okay but what about elderwood illaoi and arcana twisted fate. you're obviously the head of all league departments Kappa
[2:58:53] AugustUwU: @sussysoapp lux E is nowhere near as high damage or long range as Zeri W, Kai'sa W, and Kog R
[2:59:13] pinkvalvet: remember the drakthar nashor kaisa days ☠️☠️☠️☠️
[2:59:14] MadCat_G: what about hybrid kogmaw?
[2:59:25] Frulicity: August, is there a reason ADC champions are few are far between compared to other roles?
