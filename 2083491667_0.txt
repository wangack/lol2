[0:55:05] hanaan: Yeah caedrel is not too bad at all
[0:55:15] GrandAdmiralDangerNoodle: one streamer I watch for single player games does a break every 30 mins while ads run, so you don’t actually miss anything, which makes it less bad
[0:56:22] GrandAdmiralDangerNoodle: I personally can’t stand more than like 6 mins an hour for league because it interrupts the gameplay so bad
