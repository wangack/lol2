[2:56:34] actually_pierce: players don't care about the font, it's just that resources were put into something that didn't need to be changed
[2:56:40] hmng_tim: that slow is obnoxious
[2:56:42] Amybam: they changed the font because there were certain Korean/chinese/japanese characters that didn’t have characters in the English league font and would just show up as blank squares. it’s a QOL change that makes more names legible.
[2:56:45] actually_pierce: even though they were minimal
