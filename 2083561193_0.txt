[3:43:27] 5turdy: hihi
[3:43:58] brightdiscord: +1000
[3:44:09] philipqi: Cant reksai with HOB work as support just like camille? The only difference is that you heal instead of having a shield and ult is execute instead of extra catch potential.
[3:44:21] TAGurPREGNANT: they buffed the kog passive any thoughts on a shadow flame to make it even better? @stunt
[3:45:19] romanmordiuk: so why kog support works?
[3:45:32] ChromaKhroma: well why does velkoz support work
[3:45:44] romanmordiuk: long range poke
[3:45:57] philipqi: I feel like xerath and Velkoz would always be better than ap kog.
[3:46:01] ChromaKhroma: so does kog if u build ap
[3:46:06] romanmordiuk: full kit utilized
[3:46:18] DesuLaDesu: !song
[3:46:25] romanmordiuk: @ChromaKhroma i see
[3:46:43] ChromaKhroma: kog also can fight in lane a little differently with w
[3:46:52] ChromaKhroma: than the other mages
[3:47:37] vrgambit: Can you focus on varus to see if he is a high technology enjoyer

[3:48:34] romanmordiuk: as sup
[3:49:02] bladetrinity16: normally max e as support kog
[3:49:32] ChromaKhroma: @romanmordiuk yea i mean the w definitely helps with long trades in lane but remember that since ur supp, ur only gonna have 1-2 items for most of the game, so onhit builds might feel a bit weak later
[3:49:47] ChromaKhroma: ap u rly just need the horizon malignance to feel useful the rest is kinda bonus
[3:50:11] romanmordiuk: nice
[3:50:12] yunodx: 240 cs varus monkaS
[3:50:30] vrgambit: What you said about their only being one poke support played at a time made so much sense

[4:41:12] voidmoons: ppl were saying they wanted a skin for her
[4:41:17] SleepiEvie: 1, maybe even 2
[4:41:19] drigers5: *with perfect cs from nilah
[4:41:24] Kinkou_Order: so dev if someone bypasses 2FA does that mean they have a backdoor?
[4:41:29] Telperion16: more than 1
[4:41:48] EmpathosaurusWrex: depends on how many last hits she gets? xD
[4:42:08] quincy_chan: skill issue
[4:42:12] SleepiEvie: Seraphine E feels so slow and readable
[4:42:22] bladetrinity16: exp changes per levvel
[4:43:05] Synastar: 54 experience per non canon wave rn
[4:43:05] Tomecland: now is better to maxing e than q right?
[4:43:24] bladetrinity16: @Synastar is that with or without nilah passive bonus?
[4:43:45] Kiiyorin: wow, sera really lacks dmg
[4:43:48] vrgambit: Maybe try q>w>e max next
[4:43:55] vrgambit: With the q missile speed buff
[4:44:23] SleepiEvie: the Q in lane feels better for damage
[4:44:30] SleepiEvie: *max
[4:45:17] ChromaKhroma: wow that's such a long slow now
[4:45:20] ChromaKhroma: ranged aoe zilean e
[4:46:01] SleepiEvie: they're fightin for sure
[4:46:06] ChromaKhroma: i would be mad if my supp picked morgana too

[4:49:04] dyleni: Penalty applied?
[4:49:05] bladetrinity16: it be kinda crazy that keria is only 900 assists behind faker
[4:49:19] misszoal: why did you get a penalty?
[4:49:36] Synastar: Morgana probably should have started maxing black shield 🛡️ after falling behind like that 😬
[4:50:00] Synastar: she was totally useless and helpless
[4:50:13] fourspeech: you had to change the password?
[4:50:17] Cheeseborger1: Dang smolder winrate gone way up with new changes

[4:50:54] brein3rt: how and where are you playing pokemon? brings back memories
[4:51:03] Deielrion: people are also just more familiar wit smolder
[4:51:20] Cheeseborger1: Oh yeah that makes sense his 225 q scales better
[4:52:13] bladetrinity16: @Cheeseborger1 his R changes alone would have done that, giving the heal AD ratio and doubling the sweet spot damage
[4:52:28] SleepiEvie: Have you played the Pokemon Infinite Fusion mod? it lets you splice the pokemon together, it's pretty fun
[4:52:56] zak_vvv: 37 raiders from zak_vvv have joined!

[4:55:53] jujibiter: @stunt I liked triple tonic on seraphine before these changes, you think it's worth for a support?
[4:55:59] ChromaKhroma: i like the new font
[4:55:59] vrgambit: Viper understands laning better than any other streamer I've watched tbh
[4:56:06] ChromaKhroma: easy to read
[4:56:08] MysteriousBear: yeah cuz its the only font they have thats for all languages
[4:56:08] bladetrinity16: someone suggested comic sans cause all the team mates are clowns
[4:56:12] GlacialEmbrace: yeah they changed it so we can read Asian characters. instead of ????
[4:56:14] MysteriousBear: that supports characters
[4:56:20] vogue_hommes: can't be toxic in wingdings 5Head
[4:56:30] Cheeseborger1: I tried triple tonic with morgana and it felt alright
[4:56:54] bladetrinity16: are you sure you werent griefing by locking in morgana in 2024
[4:57:06] Cheeseborger1: It was only a silver game lol
[4:57:35] bladetrinity16: thats fair
[4:57:44] bladetrinity16: mostly because people at our elo dont know how to side step
[4:58:00] Cheeseborger1: That's right
[4:58:23] DntDeservePromo: DntDeservePromo subscribed with Prime. 
[4:58:42] OmegaMonsoon: @ChromaKhroma i thin its easy to read but i find it distracting since im not use to it so when anything pops up i have to look at it instead of focusing on what im doing
[4:59:07] bladetrinity16: watching my support face tank a morg q makes me cry, cause its so slow
[5:00:45] Cheeseborger1: She got max mana nerf but more regen right?
[5:00:51] bladetrinity16: welp thats awkward

[6:33:27] morgblankreal: yeah often times my adc's lose their minds ngl
[6:33:46] ismellurseat: boss could u play some renata on the next game??
[6:33:50] morgblankreal: sera morg bot is super strong
[6:34:08] ChromaKhroma: have u tested all the chromas for her skins tho?

[6:37:27] ChromaKhroma: u cant just say that
[6:37:35] Datous: I just started playing again and all I play is seraphine support. I used to play a few years ago, seraphine is one of the most simple kits on a champ released since before Aphelios (after I stopped) and it’s so strong.
[6:38:01] Datous: just feels like a pumped up  Sona which I used to main
[6:38:14] kaiserwroth: Prepare for trouble
[6:38:15] misszoal: @Datous true

[6:39:10] morgblankreal: u can take some cs too, i domt mind
[6:39:10] Telperion16: It's harder to interrupt dashes on janna or milio
[6:39:18] GATREUS98: report ur adc
[6:40:04] GATREUS98: the support lockout is shared globally by your team now u cannot do this.
[6:40:10] Datous: idk just feel like a lot of the newer champs that came out have way too many conditions in their kits compared to the og champs. Having a lot of fun in support now though
[6:40:39] shararr1: that morg skin slayyy
[6:43:01] zzz_iton: wait
[6:43:06] zzz_iton: we didnt win sera senna game ?

[6:45:21] hanaan: High octane lane Kappa
[6:45:29] GATREUS98: how does a bug like this even get discovered
[6:46:15] zerpentinefire: @Datous e is better tho :)
