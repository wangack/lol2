[0:12:40] MedicCasts: https://youtu.be/puN8pj7PFKQ
[0:12:50] GSE_RICKY: caedrel always saying your smart about the game, i wouldnt worry aboout these people think they'll come around caedrel has a lot of pull
[0:12:52] pomnz: Speaking of Quickshot, how's he going?
[0:13:31] pomnz: Fair enough, just hope he's doing generally well, shame to have him not on the broadcasts any more
[0:13:39] h_paraggelia_toy_the_rock: Is he at least alive?
[0:14:27] GSE_RICKY: ad = analysis desk i imagine
[0:14:27] Zoephobia: good morning medic, chat
[0:15:21] Zoephobia: get rekt lol
[0:15:22] GSE_RICKY: WeirdChamp
[0:15:39] pomnz: Hey, I put my foot in my mouth at work all the time, and that's not live in front of thousands of people!
[0:15:53] dvorky_: good morning medic and chat @MedicCasts Are looking forward for race in F1 or LEC? Greetings from Slovakia <3
[0:16:43] GSE_RICKY: people dont remember the good things
[0:17:57] Zoephobia: casting is fucking hard.
[0:17:59] bruenar_: I always feel a bit bad when someone flubs during a hype moment, can be so tricky to get  back into the flow when just talking let alone casting
[0:18:07] GSE_RICKY: it is very impressive
[0:18:14] dvorky_: I know exactly that - we had same things in Czechoslovakia casts - i was once casting LEC i did my best, gave my heart to that cast but i was talking more seconds or minutes about potion.
[0:18:30] GSE_RICKY: it is
[0:18:35] GSE_RICKY: i think we can say that
[0:18:54] bruenar_: Color casting by its very nature allows for re-explanation
[0:19:12] internet_explorer06: Wait what? 600 million only?
[0:19:34] Zoephobia: Can I bounce something off you guys?
[0:19:40] Zoephobia: centaurs have 6 limbs
[0:19:44] Zoephobia: are they insects?
[0:19:49] bruenar_: no
[0:19:53] bruenar_: insect definition is not based on limbs
[0:19:57] Zoephobia: it also has a bisected body
[0:20:04] JoaoFKY: They also have two rib cages
[0:20:16] bruenar_: insects have an exoskeleton
[0:20:19] jeriart: @MedicCasts wait. if its slowing down shouldnt we have longer hours in the day?
[0:20:30] Zoephobia: that's what it says
[0:20:37] GSE_RICKY: are all insects invertebrates
[0:20:45] jeriart: @MedicCasts oops your right.
[0:20:53] bruenar_: Now, it's definitely a fair question - where is a Centaurs heart?
[0:20:59] Zoephobia: actaully, do centaurs have 2 of every organ?
[0:21:05] ququququ71: ngl the font is still messing with my eyes
[0:21:14] jeriart: @MedicCasts am sleep deprived cognitive ability is weak.
[0:21:15] GSE_RICKY: EZ Clap
[0:21:30] Zoephobia: 7:59 xdd
[0:21:34] GSE_RICKY: people up all night malding
[0:22:31] dreamsxord: good evening weebs raizP raizE
[0:22:39] Zoephobia: in soloqueue no less
[0:22:43] SmolderFeetEnjoyer: ff
[0:22:45] Zoephobia: games aren't over until a nexus explodes
[0:22:54] NZSlappy: Pretty sure Alistar was up for ff before minions started
[0:22:56] bruenar_: It's the only thing that makes sense
[0:23:23] Zoephobia: so is one a backup heart or do they need both?
[0:23:26] MrShooot: always ff, playing more means the enemy gets better at the game and you dont want that to happen
[0:24:03] GSE_RICKY: 10 cs oof xdd
[0:24:26] Zoephobia: winnable
[0:24:27] bruenar_: At least AD TF was nerfed
[0:24:30] sidequest76: Yo Medic I just found a link to the new podcast let's go
[0:24:32] 4thinink: jungle DIFF :o
[0:24:32] ququququ71: what adc meta is your fav?
[0:24:37] GSE_RICKY: vayne lost whole wave event tho kayne should on scuttle?
[0:24:38] bruenar_: yeah
[0:24:41] GSE_RICKY: evem
[0:24:51] 4thinink: ff next
[0:24:51] bruenar_: this game is...
[0:24:53] jeriart: idgaf about this game but playing Jung will give my anxiety depression.
[0:25:05] GSE_RICKY: okay my brain is mush sorry xddWalk bye
[0:25:05] joisteus: 6 min and 14 kills .D
[0:25:40] bruenar_: I'm sure you've been asked before, but do you support any football clubs?
[0:25:53] MaraudingBacon: welcome to jungle. everything is your fault and if you win its only beucase mid is LEC calibur
[0:26:24] jeriart: im surprised how little people know about wave management. Every ADC i play with does not know how to deny waves via freezing in low elo. Its hard push every wave if possible
[0:26:24] GSE_RICKY: what are thy doing?
[0:26:28] GSE_RICKY: xdd
[0:26:29] Zoephobia: POGGIES
[0:26:41] GSE_RICKY: mega worth
[0:27:00] JoaoFKY: I played a flex game with yorick, lee and sej support trio and it was so annoying, sej took tp and left to help lee in the worst timings possible
[0:27:15] GSE_RICKY: wait isnt ap shyv way better these days?
[0:27:47] bruenar_: Gotta love the 1/7 vayne saying Ali is win trading
[0:27:57] Zoephobia: xdding
[0:28:02] ququququ71: nah
[0:28:05] bruenar_: for sure
[0:28:05] 4thinink: Is this bronze????
[0:28:06] GSE_RICKY: sup in 2024 Aware
[0:28:07] 4thinink: WTF?
[0:28:16] JoaoFKY: Lost 1v1 vs sup, but sup is win trading xdd
[0:28:33] Zoephobia: 700g noice
[0:28:39] ququququ71: xddBusiness
[0:28:41] bruenar_: vayne dead again in 10
[0:28:45] 4thinink: 11 minutes 26 CS
[0:28:46] knightrider1818: No cams today?
[0:28:50] GSE_RICKY: oh i see the build LETHIMCOOK
[0:28:57] 4thinink: Thats 2 minions a minute
[0:29:46] GSE_RICKY: catJAM
[0:30:17] Fossabot: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:31:38] ququququ71: that ain't good
[0:31:49] GSE_RICKY: when did this c meta come about
[0:31:53] MrShooot: he meant cake?
[0:32:02] MrShooot: cookies maybe also?
[0:32:10] JoeyHasADHD: :O omg why is why his is why is his cam is his cam off his cam is off :O
[0:32:18] NZSlappy: So, seeing as there is no action going on (-ironic) I just like to mention that you are on my All Star casting team as the play by play.  I'm a big fan.
[0:32:24] bruenar_: what are your thoughts on toxic positivity instead? Is saying "I hope your day gets better" at the end of the game toxic?
[0:32:27] MrShooot: Sadge
[0:32:29] Fossabot: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[0:32:34] GSE_RICKY: Sadge u never know
[0:32:41] ququququ71: probably means car
[0:32:46] ququququ71: Kappa
[0:33:21] GSE_RICKY: toxic positively sounds like a posh way to say sarcasm
[0:33:40] bruenar_: it's only sarcasm if you don't mean it
[0:33:53] GSE_RICKY: Hmm is it
[0:34:13] Fossabot: Oh yes, please give me subby wubbies, feels yummy in my tummy.
[0:34:23] bruenar_: fair
[0:34:41] GSE_RICKY: in game medic monkaH
[0:34:44] Fossabot: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:34:49] sidequest76: Kill them with kindness
[0:34:53] bruenar_: Yeah, it makes sense.
[0:34:59] ququququ71: can you play udyr jungle this patch?
[0:35:19] GSE_RICKY: tell them to go to bed, thats what they need
[0:35:37] bruenar_: One of the most frustrating parts of league is when you have teammates like this - and you know that in their mind, they weren't the problem at all
[0:36:27] 4thinink: Games/players like this is why I quit this game
[0:37:01] bruenar_: The team won't try to win
[0:37:03] GSE_RICKY: could definitely win you are so fed
[0:37:07] bruenar_: even if you started to comeback this Vayne is done
[0:37:09] GSE_RICKY: YEP
[0:37:21] JoaoFKY: Game would be so winnable if vayne didn't just start killing herself to nami
[0:37:37] GSE_RICKY: so sad these players who ruin the game for 4 other people Sadge selfish
[0:38:02] MrShooot: worst part is that the enemy didnt even look that good..
[0:39:07] bruenar_: Have you considered that you're so cool it is causing it to freeze?
[0:39:30] JoaoFKY: I hate how this players are like "stop hostaging, you're wasting my time" when they wasted my time with 10+ minutes of queue+draft and gave up 3 minutes into the game
[0:39:32] GSE_RICKY: DIESOFCRINGE
[0:39:51] hannahofstadter: just buy a new pc
[0:40:20] Zoephobia: sounds more like a software issue tbh
[0:40:37] ququququ71: DinoDance
[0:40:56] GSE_RICKY: yeh format the dive
[0:41:00] GSE_RICKY: drive
[0:41:16] hannahofstadter: excuse me
[0:41:17] GSE_RICKY: YEP i am bad
[0:41:22] hannahofstadter: freirehRiot
[0:41:24] Zoephobia: F
[0:41:28] Zoephobia: not f
[0:41:29] bruenar_: Haha, jokes on you, I barely made it to Emerald 4, thank you very much!
[0:41:32] MedicCasts: medicRiot
[0:41:39] MedicCasts: medicRage
[0:41:55] hannahofstadter: KEKW
[0:41:56] GSE_RICKY: peepoRiot
[0:42:58] GSE_RICKY: KKona and...
[0:43:06] JoaoFKY: Color KKona
[0:43:20] GSE_RICKY: gray KKona
[0:43:24] sidequest76: Actually
[0:43:24] bruenar_: I think lowkey people don't give enough credit to the Broadcast teams for LEC/LCS for how well the caster teams mesh - it's so much harder than they make it seem
[0:43:28] bruenar_: Especially tri-casts
[0:43:48] dreamsxord: medic has leveled up a lot since the beginning
[0:43:58] GSE_RICKY: medi vedi will never be beaten
[0:44:07] h_paraggelia_toy_the_rock: Oh wow really? A SHYV ANGLE!
[0:44:12] h_paraggelia_toy_the_rock: Pog
[0:44:22] JoaoFKY: I've been enjoying a lot LCS flexxing their casters from bpb to colour and vice versa
[0:45:52] GSE_RICKY: can they ask the colour casters to explain why picks are good?
[0:45:53] bruenar_: the occasional joke for fun normally comes from PBP in draft
[0:46:32] GSE_RICKY: they'll build on each other
[0:46:51] JoaoFKY: Yeah, quickshot is so good at this
[0:47:57] GSE_RICKY: kled could flash follow there, is it worth?
[0:48:04] dreamsxord: this is super interesting medic raizC
[0:49:26] GSE_RICKY: they dont have to correct you
[0:49:59] bruenar_: I remember Drakos mentioning once on a podcast that the tried-and-true PBP during lulls in gameplay is to just read the towers/gold lead to set-up Color to talk about next steps, and I smile everytime it happens haha
[0:50:12] habs1292: pre work live Pog
[0:51:38] bruenar_: peak ADC
[0:51:45] An3pic: and it gets longer on take down
[0:51:51] habs1292: medic is on smoke today
[0:52:07] GSE_RICKY: not anymore i think @An3pic
[0:52:32] GSE_RICKY: they removed it when they made it 15sec
[0:52:35] Epsi_long: Listening
[0:52:46] habs1292: lethality poppy has  deceptive damage
[0:53:31] bruenar_: 4th shot
[0:53:39] foxyvexx: Good morning medic
[0:53:46] Epsi_long: ddx
[0:53:49] bruenar_: And then he pings you both
[0:53:51] ququququ71: aint noway
[0:53:51] bruenar_: crazy
[0:53:55] JoaoFKY: Take that back Madge you aren't an idiot Madge
[0:53:58] GSE_RICKY: wideVIBE
[0:54:11] habs1292: whats the point of a scaling champ if youre constantly going to trade
[0:54:19] UnholyDonkey: This is why I cant play jungle anymore, team frustrates me too much
[0:54:56] GSE_RICKY: theres noooooo way shes stacking when u are diving'
[0:55:02] NZSlappy: well done
[0:55:21] dreamsxord: I feel bad for people who still play summoners raft but Iâ€™m glad they do so I can watch while playing last epoch raizP
[0:55:42] Epsi_long: AAAA
[0:55:45] ququququ71: did kled get the grubs?
[0:55:58] GSE_RICKY: another inter Sadge
[0:56:22] UnholyDonkey: This Kled and Smolder are just delusional, I bet they wil think theyve played this game well
[0:56:25] wraithlikestofly: Kled is such a diva lmao
[0:56:31] JoaoFKY: Now your losing lanes get TRUE damage on towers Pog
[0:56:51] Fossabot: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:56:55] An3pic: well atleast you didnÂ´t have to dodge because you had yuumi adc :D
[0:56:56] Epsi_long: xdd
[0:57:11] GSE_RICKY: i think you might need to pick j4 and gank/cover every lane
[0:57:33] bruenar_: Cheer500 Cheers, it's late here and I need to go to bed. Been a fun time. Good luck with games
[0:57:49] An3pic: atleast they donÂ´t get voidlings
[0:57:52] GSE_RICKY: j4 is fun though widepeepoSad
[0:58:02] foxyvexx: foxyvexx subscribed with Prime. 
[0:58:03] habs1292: bruh where is burenar
[0:58:26] foxyvexx: No worries <3
[0:58:55] habs1292: oh yh true
[0:58:58] An3pic: even if he would have picked j4 he would have been fked beacuse of 0 ap
[0:59:05] foxyvexx: For me it's nice and early, 08:30am :D
[0:59:27] GSE_RICKY: wow that ori is not a great player
[0:59:28] Cyric_Cerica: west coast US is 23:36
[0:59:58] Zoephobia: D:
[1:00:05] GSE_RICKY: cmon tho ori q missing there
[1:00:12] JoaoFKY: But plat is high elo
[1:00:17] An3pic: donÂ´t you think it would help you if you played with someone from your community so you have atleast one less troll
[1:00:24] nekoniclaws: question about title, is that 3 hours more sleep, gaming or work
[1:00:29] ququququ71: there is no way this is plat
[1:00:49] GSE_RICKY: now that is unfortunate
[1:00:54] habs1292: this smolder LuL

[1:01:49] JoaoFKY: Mid sup being 0/10 is fun
[1:01:53] NZSlappy: Interesting to me is the behaviours of the players are exactly the same as bronze and silver games
[1:02:46] An3pic: i feel like your time till you have 25 stacks on smolder is longer then it takes to get 225
[1:03:00] GSE_RICKY: i dont understand what is going through these players heads, to int and stop tryig
[1:03:28] jaggler: jaggler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Hey Medic, did you know that the Earth's rotation is slowing down?
[1:03:52] GSE_RICKY: pick kled mid run it down stop trying ok
[1:03:59] jaggler: UwU
[1:04:01] JoaoFKY: @gse_ricky if you start inting, you didn't lose because you're bad, you lost because you don't care and that's cool and edgy
[1:04:11] GSE_RICKY: xdd
[1:04:27] jaggler: @JoaoFKY "I didn't want to win anyways xdd"
[1:04:41] JoaoFKY: Exactly
[1:04:48] ququququ71: what about jax jg?

[1:06:29] GSE_RICKY: is that english what smolder is saying?
[1:06:47] REMmu211: @habs1292 no resurrection i guess
[1:06:57] jaggler: imagine if league players would put as much thought into their gameplay as they do with coming up with new insults or ways to say that one should unalive
[1:06:57] REMmu211: just die xd
[1:07:24] habs1292: ahhh, that should be a perma whenever that happens
[1:07:43] JoaoFKY: @habs1292 something like Solo Leveling, the alt world comes to earth instead of you reviving in a different world
[1:07:54] REMmu211: holy poppy dmg
[1:08:22] An3pic: combination of bloodsong and sundere is so much dmg

[1:10:40] An3pic: i mean if you rush it it heals 180 and you have like 1080 hp
[1:10:48] An3pic: and thats per champ
[1:10:59] An3pic: in a teamfight you get 5 heals or more
[1:11:08] habs1292: does ap shyv scale better than ad?
[1:11:21] GSE_RICKY: oof AINTNOWAY

[2:10:52] moony_jpg: @maiden_des_mondes i don't think you need to be ashamed of it tbf. it needs to undergo some progression, which i think the younger generation is working on, but obviously changing something as old and important to the culture as a really old language is hard
[2:10:52] dreamsxord: raizP morning
[2:11:17] moony_jpg: @AveSanctis hiya ave Hellowo
[2:11:25] GSE_RICKY: ICANT hows it his guy plat

[2:12:51] ElusiveFRZ: ahh ok
[2:12:51] jaggler: blue star magic shield, orange star phys shield
[2:13:08] maiden_des_mondes: @moony_jpg yeah true. it just takes (too) long and i also am probably biased so seeing that proper gendering isnâ€™t even allowed in school gets me furious. but thats what i love the english language for:)
[2:13:25] GSE_RICKY: i thought it was dependent on the dmg u took NOTED
[2:13:52] H3meroc: @GSE_RICKY It's dependent on what their main damage type is, so based on champion
[2:13:59] GSE_RICKY: @H3meroc i see NOTED
[2:14:25] GSE_RICKY: kled AINTNOWAY u sent u to tesco and back
[2:14:26] H3meroc: @GSE_RICKY Also not like, champion x always gives shield y. It depends on the current game.
[2:14:27] dutchyjos: DinkDonk
[2:14:28] jaggler: lots of bad kleds around today KEKW

[3:01:16] An3pic: i never got a fyi message do you only get them if you donÂ´t report them?
[3:01:28] Sjobbe: enjoying it so far, work is chill
[3:01:31] GSE_RICKY: its ok
[3:01:54] An3pic: is smolder enabled this saturday? and azir disabled
[3:02:48] cotran61: eyyy medic sup hope ur doing fine
[3:02:54] cotran61: and good morning
[3:03:10] AMajorSituation: Hello dear Mr. Medic! Hope you had a nice day so far and that it only gets better.
[3:03:24] An3pic: i donÂ´t know if smolder is op or not
[3:03:44] An3pic: but smolder is only playable early and late mid game he is realy useless
[3:03:48] cotran61: smolder as a champ and his kit feel fun, his stacking tho is make or break which is horrible
[3:04:07] GSE_RICKY: teams will have picks into it tho so maybe some saucy counters
[3:04:39] An3pic: i am still not sure if his e is op or useless
[3:04:40] cotran61: he's a timebomb, if you give him time to scale you win
[3:05:04] An3pic: yeah but it has like 20 seconds cooldown and gets canceld by everything
[3:05:40] Odyssey1989: Ivern mid?
[3:05:44] GSE_RICKY: game looks a bit gg from draft
[3:05:44] Odyssey1989: is that a thing?
[3:05:46] cotran61: the stacking should be similiar to the stacks swain gets
[3:05:57] Genewen: what a comp...
[3:05:59] GSE_RICKY: unless nilah is big
[3:06:02] Odyssey1989: WEll it's time for AD Shyv then no?
[3:06:15] An3pic: smolder needs 2 items + 225 stacks then he deals dmg and can build tank but all he does is burn/true dmg
[3:06:32] Odyssey1989: Yeah no conq
[3:06:34] cotran61: singed will deal exactly zero damage against that voli
[3:06:39] An3pic: mid and top smolder should be so much better cause you can get so many free stacks when your jungler take void grubis
[3:06:57] An3pic: i mean at 10 min he drops an comes back when he has 225 stacks
[3:07:17] cotran61: your comp doesnt look bad honestly, its mostly protect the carry and nilah can carry like hell
[3:07:18] An3pic: because his first item doesnÂ´t have as much impact as other adcÂ´s first item
[3:07:28] foxyvexx: When your midlaner leaves at 12 minutes -.-"
[3:07:32] foxyvexx: Feelsbadman
[3:07:45] GSE_RICKY: oh no
[3:07:49] cotran61: wait what
[3:07:51] TehEddy: @MedicCasts u as a medic can u explain how does auroras appear at 50 latitude  ????
[3:07:53] cotran61: who tf duels a darius lv 1
[3:07:56] GSE_RICKY: darius was covering proxy i think
[3:08:09] Fossabot: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.
[3:08:19] An3pic: i mean darius gets 30 ad from passive proc so you can never win level 1
[3:08:32] GSE_RICKY: KEKW no kite
[3:08:39] Fossabot: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[3:08:55] cotran61: theres like one champ who can win lv 1 against darius and thats mordekaiser, thats it, thats every top champ that can beat darius lv 1 and only with ignite
[3:09:13] GSE_RICKY: people in this elo allergic from picking normal mid champs?

[3:11:26] cotran61: also i wouldnt dare to freeze against a brand, i'd rather hard push or bro is gonna bully me
[3:11:35] An3pic: @Gilleser you can just donÂ´t q the wave
[3:11:39] An3pic: and your aa is single target
[3:12:21] An3pic: that voli realy wanted 2 grubis
[3:12:26] GSE_RICKY: i think voli should be able to fight 1v2 what happened
[3:12:27] Gilleser: @An3pic yeah but that means u give up all pressure in lane
[3:13:05] An3pic: @Gilleser you frezzing the wave doesnÂ´t mean giveing up pressure only if you frezze it till minute 10
[3:13:19] cotran61: @An3pic the wave wasnt freezing anyway, it was a slow push
[3:13:37] GSE_RICKY: poor voli Sadge
[3:13:54] An3pic: @cotran61 they had like 20 more creeps
[3:14:19] cotran61: @An3pic nilah didnt touch the wave and when she realized it slow pushes back, she pushed it, anyway doesnt matter now
