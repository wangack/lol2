[0:30:48] Ventria1: @cnephh yes
[0:30:55] SSandooo: i have a freind whos like 400 lp masters eune but 0lp masters stuck on euw
[0:30:57] gars0nnn: idk tbh iam GM on eune and i havent played on euw
[0:31:12] safewaterss: You think runaans could be ok on kalista into these short range comps? or is the item just dogshit, dont see that many people build it
[0:31:17] Zifi1: some people hit challenger eune and cant get out of diamond in euw

[0:32:20] Zifi1: i have a chall eune friend who is 70% winrate on eune and d1 police has him captive on euw
[0:32:42] kennyECS: I wouldn't say shaco is underperforming for his level. guy got matchmaking gapped.
[0:32:49] reacheeh: @safewaterss runaans would be good here, but its not as necessary as for example wits end here
[0:32:50] ascuane: @Zifi1 eune is competitive kappachungusmaximus
[0:32:54] Spearuve: im easily emerald on both euw and eune ez
[0:32:55] reacheeh: and later i guess u want to go jaksho or something
[0:33:18] ashuyoxoxo: how does kassadin have positive kda vs akshan

[0:34:55] kennyECS: @thechildofnight i know
[0:35:00] Zifi1: jgl also played for void grubs
[0:35:04] Zifi1: and avoided bot at all time
[0:35:17] Zifi1: drakes are so free with kalista
[0:35:22] reeiaa: my pointssss SadgeCry
[0:35:24] benbutler: is pridestalkr just the goat of the lvp
[0:35:25] reeiaa: why believe
[0:35:26] ashuyoxoxo: had a game in low master today where i was ahaed 4k gold but enemy team had 4 drags adn we lost
[0:35:47] reeiaa: CANCEL THE PREDICTION
[0:35:57] thechildofnight: @reeiaa you put your trust in the shaco player?
[0:35:57] Zifi1: @ashuyoxoxo i lost games where i was 10k gold ahead PepeLaugh
[0:36:00] ashuyoxoxo: jg bot gap
[0:36:12] Spearuve: alistar is so heavy he would tank my kok smashed on his forehaed so easily damn
[0:36:14] kennyECS: if you guys bet on 1 with this matchmaking gap in the jg, you're crasy
[0:36:15] ashuyoxoxo: no its just crazy thing to me that when u have winning bot u never hit drag @Zifi1
[0:36:23] reacheeh: @Jackspektra do u know how to do double jump (the one with animation reset)? I almost never see this mechanic being used by proplayers and i wonder if its because they dont practice it or what
[0:36:33] flipstaar: grubs are biggest noob trap for jungler imo so many games lost cause time or kills given at grubs @Jackspektra
[0:36:38] Zifi1: @ashuyoxoxo it wasnt winning because lee was perma bot
[0:36:47] amshash111: whats doule jump can u show in practice tool?
[0:36:49] reeiaa: @thechildofnight I put my trust in jack
[0:37:00] thechildofnight: @reeiaa true, unlucky
[0:37:01] xyzArmin: you get worse team on blueside
[0:37:04] xyzArmin: every game
[0:37:06] xyzArmin: so stupid
[0:37:23] ashuyoxoxo: he for sure doenst punch a hole into a wall somewhere
[0:37:25] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: so cringe man these losers locking in yummi
[0:37:27] Zifi1: Prayge matchmaking Prayge
[0:37:29] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: its actually so depressing
[0:37:29] thechildofnight: ill trust jack with my points next game
[0:38:04] Zifi1: @ashuyoxoxo yeah heretics have a wall only made for punching :tf:
[0:38:13] reacheeh: @amshash111 basically u just jump with aa and then instantly cast another jump with q changing the direction
[0:38:46] reacheeh: @amshash111 u have to click away somewhere else on screen to reset the first jump and then q
[0:38:57] reacheeh: and its pretty much all about timing
[0:39:07] amshash111: @reacheeh so why woudl pros not do this? is it not useful?
[0:39:24] rework3097: ye hard part is the inputing of additional click between auto and q
[0:39:37] thechildofnight: @amshash111 its very niche
[0:39:40] reacheeh: @amshash111 idk, i guess they are just not consistent with it. Kt for example (best kalista no doubt) is spamming this every game
[0:39:57] ashuyoxoxo: bro the reason no1 does it cause its very hard
[0:40:00] Zifi1: lenny does it also
[0:40:03] Zifi1: but they are otps
[0:40:06] reacheeh: yea
[0:40:26] Zifi1: they play like 10+ games of kalista a day so ofc they will do it like most of the games
[0:40:39] Zifi1: otps get bored and just do things out of pocket for fun
[0:40:40] reacheeh: i mean its not worth trying if u are not consistent with it because u can easily fuck up and missposition
[0:41:07] acee_______: picking kalistai n soloq
[0:41:10] acee_______: biggest pain
[0:41:18] acee_______: when ur support decides to pickbard and leave lane min 3
[0:41:25] amshash111: @reacheeh does he have a yt channel?
[0:41:25] acee_______: :skull:
[0:41:42] Zifi1: yeah kalista in soloq is pain
[0:41:43] Zifi1: Sadge
[0:41:44] reacheeh: @amshash111 i dont think so but he is streaming sometimes
[0:41:55] acee_______: kalista i think is genuinly op
[0:41:56] acee_______: in soloq
[0:42:00] acee_______: if ur supp plays with u
[0:42:02] acee_______: and picks normal champ
[0:42:05] acee_______: insta win bot
[0:42:21] Zifi1: yeah duoq kalista probs best dualist bot
[0:42:34] acee_______: it feels good asf
[0:42:37] acee_______: u get insta drakes etc
[0:42:41] acee_______: the control u have
[0:42:43] acee_______: over objectives
[0:42:56] FeomatarSG: @Jackspektra do you have any schedule in mind for switch to educational smurf gaming? Or just when you will feel like done with grinding?
[0:43:01] rework3097: if enemy comp is high range u are not a champ tho
[0:43:10] acee_______: but yeah umpa lumpa ben 10 on bard has to leave randomly because he saw pro players roaming
[0:43:22] scriptkiddieno11: kali only strong if ur sup is human otherwise no r low range if u r behind u r compelty useless
[0:43:24] nalf: have they buffed kog yet?
[0:43:39] benbutler: bro walked off to shout at a wall for 5 mins comes back the zenest guy ever
[0:43:40] acee_______: @scriptkiddieno11 u just dive them
[0:43:41] acee_______: lol
[0:43:47] cnephh: e nerf makes it so weird sometimes the minions wont die and you dont get reset
[0:43:52] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: she does no cap
[0:43:56] curasz: i think its to nerf the q-max variant
[0:44:11] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: last 1
[0:44:25] scriptkiddieno11: @acee_______  sup impact is too big in this meta playing vs karma senna and other high damage champ is disgusting and they out range
[0:44:28] ashuyoxoxo: its noly 10 dmg
[0:44:30] ashuyoxoxo: first e
[0:44:38] scriptkiddieno11: @Jackspektra  would u try kog they buff r to scale with ad
[0:44:48] FeomatarSG: @Jackspektra do you have any schedule in mind for switch to educational smurf gaming? Or just when you will feel like done with grinding? 󠀀
[0:45:11] ashuyoxoxo: yeah that minion break point kinda is very rough
[0:45:17] qminedit: aphelios game for the boys
[0:45:39] franbzs: yo can we know which skin is the lpp skin of the month or is it like you redeem it without knowing it?
[0:45:43] Vulcano18: kogs winrate is insane this patch
[0:45:47] Zifi1: moooom
[0:45:58] acee_______: smolder is another complete failure
[0:46:00] ashuyoxoxo: i m amazed that they didnt hotfix it
[0:46:06] scriptkiddieno11: i dont know why they buff smolder that much his e is too strong and scaling is strong now
[0:46:06] acee_______: complete failure
[0:46:06] Aura_Jakkaru: 50 ban rate
[0:46:11] qminedit: i mean his stacks late game is broken
[0:46:18] amshash111: why did they buff him was he even weak last patch
[0:46:30] qminedit: he might be the best adc vs tanks lategame
[0:46:30] yama3460: isnt smolder better mid for stacks?
[0:46:30] wesley_warrenys: @Jackspektra when u buy BlackCleaver on Zeri and when Lord dominik ?

[0:47:17] bbzinhozz: no draven FeelsBadMan
[0:47:30] iwatchtwitchtoo: Hey Jack, what would you consider the best blind pick adc's
[0:47:34] scriptkiddieno11: i honestly hate smolder play style and desgin for bot lane its annoying he depends on his q kit no auto attack or trade so shit desgin for an adc bot laner they r ruining adc because of this
[0:47:53] Bibou_LoL: @scriptkiddieno11 ye but u stack :0

[1:28:38] Aura_Jakkaru: people dont understand the patch was for spec red
[1:28:47] scriptkiddieno11: honestly u should start trying anathema vs the carry as adc its too op armor pen does not work vs anathema
[1:28:50] Zifi1: @Jackspektra u got 2 LPP skin redeems spktrBusiness
[1:28:52] nalf: how many stacks did bard ended with?
[1:28:54] Aura_Jakkaru: frozen heart for who

[1:28:57] Faramir1993: u cant do anything early game and in late game u get onshoted by asassins/mages/tanks/bruisers
[1:29:08] stevvve: @Faramir1993 adc is op tho stop crying
[1:29:14] iwatchtwitchtoo: @stevvve HAHAHAHA
[1:29:20] acee_______: real adc is broken
[1:29:25] acee_______: stop crying guys
[1:29:28] Faramir1993: @stevvve looks like u dont play adc, because adc suck rn
[1:29:33] stevvve: truer words have no been spoken
[1:29:45] scriptkiddieno11: need to build anathema in such cases very underrated item i swear if he went last item anathema vs kayn he would have never died
[1:29:47] acee_______: just be better Kappapenis
[1:29:51] iwatchtwitchtoo: well phreak is constantly saying that adc is fine
[1:29:57] xShanaar: Is it better to max w or e 2nd on smolder?
[1:30:02] stevvve: @Faramir1993 dude i wasnt serious
[1:30:04] nalf: @scriptkiddieno11 he would still die there i fear
[1:30:06] kennyECS: who has most points? how do we make it to 1 mil?
[1:30:10] petersen_lol: why is ruler scale so fking big? xD
[1:30:11] Faramir1993: @acee_______ looks like moa mainer words

[1:30:12] stevvve: @iwatchtwitchtoo yea just build shieldbow dude 4Head
[1:30:16] acee_______: adc will be always a dog role either way
[1:30:16] iwatchtwitchtoo: funnily, he himself as an adc main is not playing adc but playing janna mao, but w/e
[1:30:21] scriptkiddieno11: @nalf hmm very unlikely 30 percent less damage
[1:30:23] acee_______: because u gotta share lane withh uumpa lumpa ben 10
[1:30:26] acee_______: playing first time bard
[1:30:29] acee_______: nothing will ever change
[1:30:39] Aura_Jakkaru: @scriptkiddieno11 i dont think 30% dmg reduction is helping him from taking double his hp bar in dmg in 3 seconds
[1:30:44] scriptkiddieno11: @acee_______ in solo q true
[1:30:59] iwatchtwitchtoo: @scriptkiddieno11 but adc is always better in organised 5v5's
[1:31:00] TIBET1337: Sadge
[1:31:00] LoL_habby: can someone tell what is the lpp skin this month?
[1:31:04] stevvve: @acee_______ yeah but dying to kayn flash qw with 160 armor almost is crazy

[1:31:06] Zifi1: adc in pro play is op
[1:31:07] michaelloeth: !LEC2025
[1:31:07] Nightbot: I will go to LEC by 2025 or i retire from esports, mediocrity will not be tolerated, rank 1 and another eum win is coming.
[1:31:09] Zifi1: adc in soloq is pain
[1:31:09] xxhide1: you can see the ezreal ult get casted ?
[1:31:18] acee_______: @stevvve ye thats how the game is atm phreak design
[1:31:20] iwatchtwitchtoo: @IMW_Lecro supp is the strongest soloq role
[1:31:26] acee_______: support is legit strongest role
[1:31:27] acee_______: in the game
[1:31:29] TIBET1337: they should bring back duoq again

[1:31:51] IMW_Lecro: my supports make it look weak KEKW
[1:31:51] scriptkiddieno11: @Aura_Jakkaru it does 30 percent underrated number bro if u deal 3k damage 30 percent of that is 900 ! thats op also anathema gives like 400 hp or something he would likely servive
[1:31:52] acee_______: would have saved him
[1:31:53] acee_______: there
[1:31:57] TIBET1337: @ADL1337 RIOT

[1:32:36] CanamEUW: @scriptkiddieno11 wasnt a build issue, he just accidentally didnt zhonyas
[1:32:41] ADL1337: turn up the light Dance

[1:32:46] acee_______: getting paid 500k peer year
[1:32:48] acee_______: to balance the game
[1:32:51] TIBET1337: that's better
[1:32:53] iwatchtwitchtoo: We deserve it guys, back then when Overheal and BT were op we werent using them enough, and now we re not utilising shieldbow well :(
[1:32:56] hbsz: i have more fun playin jg in emerald than playing ad on my main atm
[1:33:03] stevvve: @CanamEUW how can he react to kayn flash qw its literalyl miliseconds and hes dead
[1:33:08] scriptkiddieno11: @CanamEUW hard to react and expect 1 hit without r only q w auto full hp gone

[1:33:37] debe__: he is gaslighting you

[1:33:42] SlowMooCow: hmmMeeting
[1:33:45] Faramir1993: LUL
[1:33:48] Faramir1993: clown company
[1:33:55] Accusedv2: is it that new setting
[1:33:57] Xeo20: its buggy
[1:34:01] Xeo20: with flash and cast
[1:34:07] 365Doors: that shit got bugged AGAIN???
[1:34:09] Vxfboy: But how insane is it that there is a thing as a bug list? Probably bugs on there that have been in the game for 5+ years
[1:34:12] Faramir1993: LUL
[1:34:12] BuhMatej: HUHH
[1:34:13] ashuyoxoxo: if u dont have it on and throw twitch w
[1:34:16] m0zz: its like jarvan e
[1:34:17] ashuyoxoxo: he ll walk the way to the cruscor
[1:34:18] hbsz: is it like varus e
[1:34:18] loory1: its like out of circle if u click it will choose the closest
[1:34:20] ashuyoxoxo: cursor*
[1:34:22] hbsz: syndra q
[1:34:23] MaybeAndy0: Like if you dont have range on a non targeted spell, it casts at max range
[1:34:23] Pryz0r: is that bug list public?
[1:34:23] qminedit: like viktor E
[1:34:26] Rhyohan: Think about Annie R or Gragas Q
[1:34:27] cantelar1176: hey there!! hope ur doing great, why yesterday u played senna whitout farming?
[1:34:28] loory1: ye its like vaurs e or jarvan e
[1:34:29] kennyECS: it casts spells at max range ( cass Q, varus E etc
[1:34:36] Xeo20: if a target is out of range for nami bubble it still casts at max range instead of walking into the range and casting it
[1:34:37] AdmiralEdgarGorgon: It means if you throw a skillshot like brand W outside of it's actual range, it will just cast at max range
[1:34:38] kennyECS: when your cursor is outside
[1:34:41] AquaUrchin: Don't think it's applicable to smolder. Think aoe skill shots like Sandra Q
[1:34:45] ann1337: you cant test it on smolder (best user of this setting is like viktor)
[1:34:46] Mehdehh: This is for aoe on the ground anyway, Q is targeted so i dont see how that would affect it
[1:34:47] nalf: oh
[1:34:48] Accusedv2: if u use MF E outside of its max range, it'll cast at max distance instead of making u move to the spot where you cast MF E
[1:34:50] ADL1337: oh
[1:34:51] hbsz: it will just cast it instad of going in range to cas it
[1:34:52] Zhedish: Can you say the name for your outro song in your videos @Jackspektra ? Prayge 󠀀
[1:35:02] dot145: whats the bug?
[1:35:07] levf77: uwu
[1:35:26] mrmachine123: !rank
[1:35:26] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/EUW/SPKTR-SPKTR 󠀀
[1:35:26] scriptkiddieno11: happend twice that is a bug 100 percent
[1:35:29] Accusedv2: this alway shappened?
[1:35:29] LoL_habby: @Jackspektra but didnt your Q bug only when ezreal E'ed?
[1:35:30] Xeo20: ye its bugged with for example with rell if you flash w you jump into the wrong direction
[1:35:34] facundouwux: Hola Jack <3
[1:35:37] Accusedv2: yeah it happened a lot
[1:35:46] ashuyoxoxo: happened when u caught ez in ur botside jungle
[1:36:03] stevvve: can you do that now?
[1:36:10] MaybeAndy0: @Zhedish Kenya Grace - Strangers
[1:36:11] scriptkiddieno11: @Jackspektra  or just anathema instead of ldr on kayn u cant die underrated item try it
[1:36:15] MaybeAndy0: But its also some sort of remix
[1:36:26] Zhedish: Yea but what remix
[1:36:33] Zifi1: @Zhedish Kenya Grace - Strangers (Kanine Remix)
[1:36:50] ADL1337: he has plot armor
[1:36:54] iwatchtwitchtoo: maybe sell Rapid since ure mostly hitting frontline and get a deffensive item? or is Rapid just that nice value on Smolder
[1:36:56] ADL1337: you weren't meant to win that one
[1:36:56] Accusedv2: @scriptkiddieno11 anathema def the best defensive item if 1 person is one shotting u, but honestly idk if that wouldve saved him there
[1:36:59] kennyECS: but it doesnt go on CD. it seems like he dashed out mid- animation
[1:37:06] Accusedv2: that kayn does a ridic amount of damage at this point
[1:37:14] zygmundfreud: this bug was added recently, I don't remember it on release
[1:37:19] Zhedish: @Zifi1 @Zifi1 legend
[1:37:28] bononah: wtf
[1:37:28] TV_Toasty_: i dont think it depends on that setting
[1:37:30] bononah: thats so cringe
[1:37:34] Accusedv2: legit never seen this happen
[1:37:35] toms_tomato: it looks like it hits no? just a visual bug
[1:37:37] ADL1337: visual bug I guess
[1:37:38] Accusedv2: p sure its this patch
[1:37:40] ADL1337: watch replay
[1:37:48] Faramir1993: i think it buged with u RFC and E or just with E
[1:37:53] AtlysGG: maybe flash north?
[1:38:01] scriptkiddieno11: @Accusedv2 i dont know why people do not relize how op that item vs one champ threat like rengar kha kayn i have tried it alot before yes u might die but trust alot harder cheap item
[1:38:12] ADL1337: does gwen W block ally bard ult?
[1:38:15] chen12345678910112: smolder q be like : now u see me now u dont
[1:38:26] bononah: u should e up not to the right no
[1:39:00] 1lmann2: shojin still better than navori?
[1:39:03] lightwick: i dont think ult blocks ur zhonyas no?
[1:39:07] scriptkiddieno11: i think u can zonhya during r
[1:39:09] shaavola: Isnt ldr a bit int with smolders dmg profile?
[1:39:22] iwatchtwitchtoo: @bononah Sion would just chase on that direction
[1:39:23] 1lmann2: @lightwick cant zhonys while in r animation?
[1:39:26] shaavola: Or is it about the giant slayer?
[1:39:28] stevvve: @shaavola ye
[1:39:28] Zifi1: @Jackspektra u have 3 lpp skin redeems spktrBusiness
[1:39:32] Choc_xD: @shaavola smolder only has 20% magic damage
[1:39:35] bononah: @iwatchtwitchtoo cant do thst without ulti
[1:39:36] zygmundfreud: is there any new build ideas on Draven? I like Kraken on him
[1:39:44] Choc_xD: rest is physical and true damage
[1:39:46] 1mbox: Will be Smolder ban now in lvp?
[1:39:59] byFleexz: which adc u think are the best i new patch? @jackspektra
[1:40:04] 1mbox: yesterday looked a nightmare to play vs him in competitive
[1:40:05] iwatchtwitchtoo: @Jackspektra Wouldnt it be better to sell Rapid that late into the game, or is the extra range just that valuable
[1:40:06] ghian_u: manamune viable?
[1:40:09] shaavola: Yeah for giant slayer i understand the reasoning
[1:40:42] cid_20: !proview
[1:40:42] Nightbot: if jacks watching a lpl or lck proview its probably from this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@LPLlive/videos
[1:40:47] shaavola: Manamune shojin eclipse angle?
[1:40:52] Aura_Jakkaru: AD is so much more valuable also that e feels like a real spell dmg wise
[1:40:55] shaavola: Just stack a fkton of ad
[1:40:58] Aura_Jakkaru: it has no ap scaling
[1:41:35] Faramir1993: @Jackspektra  mayby even hubris now viable on smolder?
[1:41:41] TIBET1337: when will the stream end today sir?
[1:42:03] nalf: but kog shyjj
[1:42:27] Vxfboy: How did your game go yesterday evening?

[1:42:58] bononah: ew
[1:43:16] iwatchtwitchtoo: It really sucks when you lose a game due to draft blunders cause it feels like you dont learn much

[3:36:40] Accusedv2: 0 dmg early*
[3:36:44] Aura_Jakkaru: @zengetsuad "i thought it was a nerf but his winrate is up 2% this patch, and my theory is that its because of the E change" said just before you entered chat

[3:37:49] nalf: yeah i would say nashors seems pretty useless this game
[3:38:41] Aura_Jakkaru: lossing to pebbles
[3:38:48] Accusedv2: @Aura_Jakkaru i think after u get 225 stacks u start snowballing letting u build more AD items, which means u dont have to wait for stacks to make ur Q do more damage
[3:39:00] Accusedv2: @yeandhi LMAO
[3:39:01] demon1_lol: Kaenic angle?
[3:39:12] caraig2003: wits end?

[3:39:44] zocker26: @Jackspektra are pen items good on smolder than liandrys
[3:39:59] Aura_Jakkaru: @Accusedv2 E has alot more strength earlier on in the game now than before, at 250 stacks ur getting the same value as 100% crit last patch now, and the snow ball aspect as well
[3:40:17] nalf: do you think you should have skipped E upgrade this game?

[5:01:42] kennyECS: you don't need ult if you only W from off screen i guess
[5:01:44] caraig2003: @carri7777 they added extra range on it

[5:13:26] PiskHeLLo: @Deielrion u dont need 5k mana on kaisa, u use 5 to 8 W in a fight and then its a 4v5 cause u oneshot a target so the tf is free
