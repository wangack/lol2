[1:11:18] LtChezo: ok
[1:11:20] seigebrisbane: teemo's poison doesnt stack tho right so more attk speed is just more AD portion of auto? it doesnt add more poison?

[1:40:24] razer_mon: afk
[1:40:28] seigebrisbane: ggs
[1:41:58] seigebrisbane: its bc you were too close to your own minion
[1:42:02] seigebrisbane: so she got on top of you
[1:44:00] Ciestallon: i think thats why she backed off
[1:44:10] 514484: might have to start blind?
[1:44:11] lego_PRO: she has more armor
[1:44:50] Ciestallon: melee diff
[1:45:04] seigebrisbane: does exhaust pop unflinching?
[1:45:06] h4nkeyy: If a contact champ can't outtrade a melee champ when he rich him kinda sus
[1:45:11] seigebrisbane: is its slow consider CC?
[1:45:18] seigebrisbane: ah ok
[1:45:20] seigebrisbane: ty

[1:46:44] biglionv2: @Ciestallon theres so many bad ones it doesnt matter
[1:46:46] 514484: no, many bans for teemo, if not for match ups junglers exist
[1:47:09] h4nkeyy: seems that the range minions was hard focusing you also; 3 range minions deal alot to a lvl 1 teeto
[1:47:17] 514484: still plenty of junglers
[1:47:40] seigebrisbane: TF got nerf hard :(
[1:47:41] drunkhog: Briar is a bit much

[1:49:52] seigebrisbane: I was here yesterday when you add it, not new :)
[1:50:16] seigebrisbane: that nasty ghoster
[1:50:20] seigebrisbane: camille
[1:50:46] Ciestallon: Ye even if not, good to have it on just in case tbh
[1:51:34] PfstFischer: cant you just use the one that covers everything except lanes ?
[1:51:54] PfstFischer: i guess thats still bad with shrooms
[1:52:06] 514484: not covering the lanes is stoopid, lane ganks man
[1:52:12] 514484: idk why they don that
[1:52:21] 514484: and you can see the enemy laner come bak too
[1:52:32] falun_the_penguin: Solution 5 min delay

[1:53:41] O0Elias0O: Yes zac top is turbo brocken rn. Even after nerf
[1:53:49] brucethegoose69: jesus that healing
[1:53:53] O0Elias0O: And super ez to play aswell
[1:54:10] seigebrisbane: :(
[1:54:13] seigebrisbane: blob man
[1:54:29] Ciestallon: what is his heal as well NotLikeThis
[1:54:36] Jadistk: wait the latest patch buffed zac, increased his W damage
[1:55:24] Jadistk: oh no it increased initial dmg but then nerfed scaling, my bad
[1:56:21] Ciestallon: that sustain is wild
[1:56:24] seigebrisbane: sticky situation
[1:56:47] CrusherStrife: buy antiheal
[1:57:22] Ciestallon: annoying that he got saved by passive as well
[1:59:20] lego_PRO: that flash KEKW
[2:00:47] seigebrisbane: blob man is not cool
[2:00:47] 514484: monkaS

[2:01:53] Ciestallon: tankmo still a thing?
[2:02:14] 514484: short range jump can't be dodged without a dash it seems
[2:02:58] seigebrisbane: DANG PASSIVE
[2:03:00] seigebrisbane: OP
[2:03:05] AladeenArryn: LUL
[2:03:13] ryzemetaplease: Holy crap Zac is nuts
[2:03:15] Ciestallon: saved by passive again
[2:03:18] seigebrisbane: why so hard to kill blobs on ground
[2:03:25] seigebrisbane: cheater zac
[2:04:30] Vickens: avengers ascend! xD
[2:05:58] 514484: because they take elss aoe most likely
[2:06:59] seigebrisbane: you would think 1 auto+poison should kill 1 of the blob
[2:07:07] drunkhog: Baus Teemo strat 5Head
[2:09:04] Jadistk: WE RICH
[2:10:03] lego_PRO: does runaans help kill blobs?
[2:10:08] CrusherStrife: 4kgold
[2:10:10] seigebrisbane: weird, turret shot was mid-air but you kill turret so it didnt do dmg
[2:10:25] lego_PRO: @seigebrisbane thats normal
[2:10:34] seigebrisbane: doesnt make sense
[2:10:45] lego_PRO: it was always like that
[2:10:50] lego_PRO: with turrets
[2:10:54] seigebrisbane: ya thats fine, doesnt make sense tho
[2:11:54] seigebrisbane: fleet of foot <3

[2:13:42] Awellner: why does teemo get a 300g shutdown placed on him while 2/9/0?
[2:14:01] CrusherStrife: ipav what do you think about phantom dancer?
[2:14:03] lego_PRO: @Awellner because he got 1k from killing Zac
[2:14:58] lego_PRO: this EZreal is blasting
[2:20:12] CrusherStrife: already cap AS
[2:21:11] AladeenArryn: LUL
[2:21:13] lego_PRO: LOOOOOOOOOL

[2:21:15] VanGuardMan: ultı :(
[2:21:15] Jubey96: LOL
[2:21:18] DontFeedPenguins: no way
[2:21:18] lego_PRO: outplayed
[2:21:42] seigebrisbane: why is his passive still unkillable as AD teemo
[2:22:19] Jadistk: I think timo needs buffs to be honest
[2:22:58] ryzemetaplease: Teemo and Ryze, two of the most abandoned and hated champions in the game. We must stand together and demand more for our champions
[2:23:59] ryzemetaplease: and is still sitting at the bottom of the list
[2:25:00] 514484: delete maligma and revert nerfs to begin with
[2:25:53] ryzemetaplease: I guess us low elo mains cant have fun with our mains as well Sadge
[2:26:38] 514484: KEKW
[2:26:58] lego_PRO: 1.79% pickrate
[2:27:06] ryzemetaplease: very small sample size it seems
[2:27:18] 514484: these stats are getting more bullshit by the day
[2:28:20] ryzemetaplease: A GM or Challenger player could probably win with Yuumi jungle in silver
[2:29:03] 514484: udyr is incredibly easy to play, it's just that they haven't picked up on him
[2:30:33] seigebrisbane: silver dont watch Trick2g?
[2:31:04] seigebrisbane: his passive give more stat
[2:31:17] seigebrisbane: double armor
[2:31:19] seigebrisbane: 2x
[2:33:25] ryzemetaplease: wait on op.gg is low tier in Masters+ and silver globally. He's not even on the list for challenger meaning he does suck both high and low
[2:34:47] seigebrisbane: this lee sin rage
