[1:21:48] GreenBaePackers: @santorin Thoughts on neeko jungle? Think of the lane ganks LUL
[1:21:56] NightShado81: jungle and support has made me tiltproof
[1:22:13] DarkSaionara: exactly. I realized I was not having fun, so there's no point
[1:22:37] DenFedeKonge: do you play towards or away from an enemy tf lane?
[1:22:39] GhostxxHorse: santorinHype santorinHype santorinHype
[1:22:44] thekbshow4: I took a 6 year break form lol. Came back and the griefers and toxic players are everywhere. Was never this bad before
[1:22:53] NightShado81: @Santorin no eclipse first?
[1:24:19] GreenBaePackers: Xin looks pretty strong this patch
[1:24:22] iiNumb3rz: How do you ward hop so smoothly?
[1:24:29] lilterp_: does it show to enemy team that you killed grubs one by one or all at once?
[1:24:41] nwa4lifeTV: tab
[1:24:59] irelia80t: @lilterp_ announcer is only after the set dies, otherwise you can tab, and see if any grub has been killed
[1:25:07] lilterp_: ty guys
[1:25:24] iiNumb3rz: So its just a speed issue I think. That's how I do it but I just do it slower.
[1:25:51] NightShado81: clean kick
[1:25:56] nwa4lifeTV: xz autoing a minion LUL
[1:26:29] Broitone: this lee sin has eys
[1:26:32] iiNumb3rz: Lol they played that very poorly
[1:26:33] GreenBaePackers: You're CRACKED on Lee
[1:26:44] solidussovis: are you clean cause it looked like you did Zoe dirty as fugg
[1:26:49] GreenBaePackers: And selfmade is tilting off the face of the earth
[1:27:16] nwa4lifeTV: as a xz player, it hurt my eyes when he autoed the minion when he can clearly 3rd strike u
[1:27:42] TheTrakker: everytime i see people playing lee sin i wanna play him and then i remember that i suck at him PepeHands
[1:27:51] thekbshow4: Did you see the khazix skin coming out?
[1:28:31] basik: it makes them use spells and saves yours for a potential turn or another play
[1:28:59] thekbshow4: also lee's Q is an execute so if you 1v1 someone its better to Q after kick. Get max damage.
[1:29:42] irelia80t: @iiNumb3rz for me, i an on quick cast and disabling indicator, works just fine, you also need to disable the "Cast the pressed button upon pressing another spell"
[1:29:49] nwa4lifeTV: xz r for ks
[1:29:54] lilterp_: it's ok mid got plates!
[1:29:54] peonsrage: YEP

[1:30:02] iiNumb3rz: @irelia80t thanks
[1:30:08] irelia80t: @thekbshow4 it's no longer an execution, just extra damage
[1:30:36] iiNumb3rz: Time to kill karma again
[1:30:53] irelia80t: @iiNumb3rz also you need to have camera unlockedv as you may move, your mouse may move as well LUL
[1:30:54] thekbshow4: @irelia80t thats good to know. I'm an old school player.
[1:31:14] peonsrage: @irelia80t Susge fancy meeting you here
[1:31:17] nwa4lifeTV: conq xz, no man balls to go tempo
[1:31:26] irelia80t: @thekbshow4 yeah same, had to check it once when i didn't execute, it is fixed damage related to missing %, old one was better when you do missing % health damage
[1:31:31] iiNumb3rz: Oh no karma.
[1:31:40] irelia80t: @peonsrage that's my boi, how u doing ?
[1:31:41] RealWicari: and karma tps to die, just one of those games Sadge

[1:32:31] NightShado81: fair I just have ptsd from tank karma tops
[1:32:39] irelia80t: @peonsrage but still good, any WR improvement is good to take, so happy for you, waiting for my release to grind LUL
[1:32:39] peonsrage: @irelia80t That is on todays agenda though.. I'm at 99/100 games in 2 days on Vi so I just need to finish that last one lol
[1:32:50] nwa4lifeTV: xz good w to catch 3

[1:33:12] peonsrage: @irelia80t Still having issues with Udyr taking over my top laners though.. teemo's leaving my games left and right Sadge
[1:33:16] iiNumb3rz: Yiu haven't killed karma for about 2 mins. Probably time to go find her.
[1:33:30] peonsrage: She'll probably just come down for her punishment
[1:33:55] peonsrage: team taking it on the nose for the Karma, that's nice of them!
[1:34:03] thekbshow4: GOATED song

[1:35:35] thekbshow4: that sleep was 2 seconds or more even with murks my god
[1:35:41] peonsrage: @irelia80t It's so hard to deal with others mental too lol like just gotta make it to 15, we ain't making it past the Udyr LOL
[1:36:23] iiNumb3rz: Help me understand how your brian works. Did yiu know you needed to flash to kill Zoe before you engaged or did you do it out of reaction?
[1:36:46] solidussovis: Go play Dark Souls/ Elden Ring. It will destroy your mental and then you can rebuild
[1:37:29] GreenBaePackers: I love chemtech map with the empowered pants
[1:37:33] GreenBaePackers: Plants
[1:38:02] iiNumb3rz: Having herald feels like a curse. Cant ward. Can't sweeper.

[1:39:51] GreenBaePackers: How long does herald stay in your inventory @santorin
[1:39:51] Nyanra: harald baron and 6 grubs
[1:39:57] toxicgamesonly: Just want to say that I appreciate you interact with your viewers. Alot of top rank players dont at all in their streams.
[1:39:59] iiNumb3rz: I've just been spamming viego. He feels very good.
[1:40:06] 9tailz_: Herald 6 grubs and baron = end in 1 push TPFufun
[1:40:15] iiNumb3rz: I got my full clear down to 3:15 solo and it feels great
[1:40:15] CJGMercs: i never understood why pros dont use the more broken champs compared to things like lee/viego
[1:40:25] agent_jb008: ok what do you think about briar? @santorin
[1:40:30] RifleEU: @iiNumb3rz raptors or red start

[1:54:14] ajtheturtle_xo: how does riot create more high level challenger players?
[1:55:06] SublimeSoul: Higher elo is lessflame compared to lower elo though. It doesn't motivate you in lower elo as much
[1:55:44] reuvencl: Yeah but in the same time how are you supposed to learn and be better at the game if you dont play versus players with higher rank than you
[1:56:17] SublimeSoul: It's like I gotta constantly mute all each game lol
[1:57:17] tugwos: Riot's also trying to keep the queue times down and not just have the same 10 challenger players in game against each other all day

[2:55:50] lewhitehd69: @alabamahammer02 yes (im silver)
[2:56:36] MrHandsomeNoodle: yeah i think panth can be pretty strong in mid or low elo. clear might be a bit of an issue at higher elo
[2:56:56] lewhitehd69: why kaisa? cause invis / R ?
[2:57:40] PensPrez: As someone who leans towards tanks over anything else, Elise with Rylai's rush and Glacial Augment has felt fun in the jungle
[2:57:55] melkboer_: not a raptor start?
[2:58:40] GhostxxHorse: you showed that voli!
[2:58:50] nwa4lifeTV: @PensPrez but what if u miss e

[2:59:13] nwa4lifeTV: LUL
[3:00:07] glitchy_1111: how come when i lose i lose 30 lp and when iwin i get 17 lp
[3:01:11] lackmind9: @glitchy_1111 Your MMR is not aligned with your rank. Or Riot expected you to win when you lost
[3:01:24] cavemandi: hotguy6pack back at it again with the chiseled chin and spicy gameeplay
[3:01:40] Vexilzz: !opgg

[3:02:44] melkboer_: Chat help me out, what to buy? Coven, sprit blossom or soul fighter eve skin?
[3:02:49] DemionDemon: @glitchy_1111 keep winning till it goes  into black
[3:02:55] lewhitehd69: @melkboer_ coven
[3:03:30] lackmind9: @DemionDemon Pretty much this
[3:03:43] Social_Phobia: @melkboer_ high noon
[3:03:59] CJGMercs: how do you not lose your mind or tilt in this game. ive had like back to back to back games of someone just throwing a fit like a child and ruining my time
[3:04:04] melkboer_: @lewhitehd69 ik this is the only right answer but i like the visuals of the other two :/
[3:04:16] melkboer_: @Social_Phobia hmm, not a BIG fan tbh
[3:04:29] Social_Phobia: @melkboer_ still better than all the 3 mentioned xD
[3:04:52] melkboer_: @Social_Phobia really? you don't like the visuals of the others?
[3:04:59] Arisutra: good afternoon!
[3:05:36] ARCHONtra: Fleetwood Mac is great. I love Lindsey Buckingham
[3:05:45] DemionDemon: @melkboer_ get Soul Fighter.. become a weeb. win/win.
[3:06:23] Social_Phobia: @melkboer_ not at all, coven feels clunky as hell and the passive covers too much of your screen imo, also the timings to pop W with your q look very different to all the other skins :)
[3:06:24] Arisutra: doing good! trying out kog'maw after the buffs with mixed results, haha. how are the games going?
[3:06:42] TheTrakker: xddTeletubbies
[3:07:05] billzera13: lmao that emote
[3:07:25] TheTrakker: making good use of the passive buffs? Kappa
[3:07:33] matchapoundcake: @melkboer_ all 3 asianguySmart i love spirit blossom the best
[3:08:02] Arisutra: passive movespeed got buffed, his E slow got buffed, some QoL on his Q animatio speed
[3:08:09] Arisutra: @TheTrakker inting kog'maw strat ;)
[3:08:22] melkboer_: @DemionDemon best argument tbh LMAO
[3:08:40] lubemila: too many santorinTele day?
[3:08:45] GreenBaePackers: Can you pls explain the grub shielding? Its hard to read for smite @santorin
[3:08:58] Arisutra: he still feels super comp dependent
[3:09:45] GreenBaePackers: That's fantastic thank you
[3:09:51] iloumannaughti: sniping
[3:10:13] Arisutra: LUL
[3:10:18] RayeAerinae: human beings? ModCheck
[3:11:05] Nightbot: @DemionDemon -> Sometimes you scare me! [stop posting links] [warning]
[3:11:49] DemionDemon: AI taking over EUW Challenger, as displayed by your team.
[3:12:14] DemionDemon: they`re bots, it means they`re bots
[3:12:39] TheTrakker: is that the 2nd time today that voli gets fed and then fucking sends it? xdd
[3:14:31] iloumannaughti: naut just walking by
[3:15:00] Arisutra: on the plus side, you can't lose stacks when you die if you have no stacks 5head
[3:15:08] TheTrakker: it seems like the enemy team really likes exhausting you xdd
[3:15:46] iiNumb3rz: Is volis kit simple? I've never played him
[3:15:52] morbidnumbskull: Yoyoyoyo wassup boss
[3:16:47] Silfel: @iiNumb3rz Oh yes. Q is a speed buff with a short stun, W is auto reset (with potential heal), E is the AoE shield thing
[3:16:52] iiNumb3rz: They really need to nerf support gold I think.
[3:17:13] GreenBaePackers: BOT LANE IS WEAK BTW
[3:17:23] Praetor_GG: I mean senna in particular is a problem
[3:17:44] GreenBaePackers: Actually disgusting champ that is senna
[3:17:49] GreenBaePackers: Exactly
[3:17:49] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG she just got nerfed Kappa
[3:17:53] iiNumb3rz: In my piss low games you see a lot of people locking in carries on support. Then just build regular items. And the games go on so long it's another carry.
[3:18:00] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ so did maokai KEKW
[3:18:07] basik: senna is weak against assassin junglers oh wait nvm
[3:18:20] Arisutra: senna has been my solo queue ban for the best part of three months now
[3:18:51] Arisutra: either she's on the enemy team being OP or she's on my team making me feel insecure about being the inferior ADC
[3:19:03] DrogonBTW: didnt eve get nerf this patch?
[3:19:05] Social_Phobia: shadowflame on eve?
[3:19:07] Social_Phobia: why
[3:19:16] iiNumb3rz: 5% ap scaling on q I think
[3:19:22] Praetor_GG: ult crit
[3:19:26] nwa4lifeTV: but lichbane core also got nerfed
[3:19:33] Social_Phobia: wouldnt that be deathcap? ^^
[3:20:06] Ploxer: both adc dead but support balanced role
[3:20:22] iiNumb3rz: I dont like ashe on my team personally.
[3:20:24] FantasionDK: Santorin you in Denmark these days?
[3:20:24] melkboer_: @Social_Phobia gold starved this game. Waiting on a rod wouldve felt so bad i think
[3:20:31] Arisutra: double support botlane OP
[3:20:40] basik: you should camp the trist maybe?
[3:20:46] Social_Phobia: @melkboer_ true but i usually go void then or banshee
[3:21:00] melkboer_: @Social_Phobia valid
[3:21:01] DrogonBTW: death cap is good as early as 3rd item not sooner right?
[3:21:17] Praetor_GG: shadowflame is almost always better than void
[3:21:27] iiNumb3rz: 2 ws kaisa kill. The balance pog
[3:22:02] Praetor_GG: yeah cryptbloom is really nice too
[3:22:05] Social_Phobia: @melkboer_ shadowflame on eve is overkill
[3:22:06] DrogonBTW: on avg do u like shadowflame over hor focus?
[3:22:14] Sejstargazin: they chased the supp instead of ending
[3:22:16] nwa4lifeTV: new item needs to shine
[3:22:25] Arisutra: RIP Po
[3:22:29] iiNumb3rz: Tinky winky dispy and lala
[3:22:31] FIurbz: RIP po :(
[3:22:34] Praetor_GG: @Social_Phobia incorrect
[3:22:35] iiNumb3rz: No shot lol
[3:22:44] Kimakaze: @santorin when was the last time you played in elo below diamond?
[3:22:48] reuvencl: atleast is not raining lmao
[3:22:53] FIurbz: EXODIA
[3:22:57] Sejstargazin: @Kimakaze when he was still in the womb
[3:23:02] iiNumb3rz: @kimprobably like season 2
[3:23:13] Social_Phobia: @Praetor_GG if you say so ^^
[3:23:35] FantasionDK: Santorin you in Denmark these days?
[3:23:37] Sejstargazin: I thought this matchup was unplayable for voli
[3:23:40] louiecheese: hello jg king lil bro what’s up chat lil bro
[3:23:43] solidussovis: whoa games took a turn since i left
[3:23:49] Praetor_GG: @Social_Phobia "overkill" only makes sense if there are other better options, other options are worse
[3:24:31] iiNumb3rz: How many kills does a santorin get on a fresh account in a normals game?
[3:24:48] reuvencl: aram with viewers?
[3:24:50] Sejstargazin: @iiNumb3rz kills win games
[3:25:28] iiNumb3rz: Lol a penta a day
[3:25:30] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG shadowflame has incredible bad stats till 4th item tho
[3:25:38] iiNumb3rz: Can we please see one of these games?
[3:25:51] Dojimeister: don't most ppl just buy the level 30 acc
[3:26:02] solidussovis: nows your chance to get out Santo
[3:26:05] nwa4lifeTV: @Dojimeister thats against the t&c
[3:26:15] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ again, all relative to other items, which makes this not a fact, and you are ignoring the passive for some reason
[3:26:24] Dojimeister: yeah ofc it is... but everyone still does it
[3:26:30] Dojimeister: it's never punished
[3:26:43] Santorin: santorinTele
[3:26:50] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG im talking about analytic stats, not about the item stats :)
[3:26:57] CJGMercs: monkaW adc
[3:27:05] GreenBaePackers: santorinTele
[3:27:08] solidussovis: santorinTele santorinWave
[3:27:09] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG And ofc stats dont say anything but it also doesnt say noithing
[3:27:28] Sejstargazin: @melkboer_ 4th item stats have very little data tbh
[3:27:30] kennsey_: hi , guys , just came here to say shadowflame was a mistake for a behind eve
[3:27:31] solidussovis: Viking can wave bye to the telle tubbies
[3:27:36] Arisutra: just channel that baby in the sun energy, that baby was perma happy as fuck
[3:27:40] louiecheese: what’s happening in 14 days
[3:27:50] FantasionDK: You gonna live in Denmark now? Or why is Kaypea applying for visa? @Santorin
[3:27:56] TheTrakker: your password is password123 YEP
[3:28:01] CJGMercs: argue with the pro player yes
[3:28:03] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ maybe mobalytics is too much info for you, could write an essay about how that makes no sense but I'm not going to :)
[3:28:14] FIurbz: Winter's Approach.
[3:28:31] Nightbot: @iiNumb3rz -> Woohoo! [stop posting links] [warning]
[3:28:39] DrogonBTW: wait kaypea is moving to den?
[3:28:39] iiNumb3rz: I didn't post a link
[3:28:41] DrogonBTW: D:
[3:28:46] iiNumb3rz: Oh wait I'd did.
[3:29:00] melkboer_: @Sejstargazin well, at any point is has little data lol
[3:29:11] reuvencl: what tv series do you watch
[3:29:17] DrogonBTW: YOURE DISGUSTING MAN LOL WHY U DOING THAT TO THEM LOOL
[3:29:21] DemionDemon: we call that thing on your finger "half`o`handcuff".
[3:29:25] Sejstargazin: @melkboer_ 4000 games for 2nd item data is pretty good. usually I only care about data for the first two items
[3:29:39] DrogonBTW: LOOOOL\
[3:29:39] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ one of the many reasons it's silly to argue from stats gathered after the fact and not controlled
[3:29:49] louiecheese: play tank bully
[3:29:57] iiNumb3rz: HOT GUY 6 PACK RETURNS
[3:30:02] TorqueBandit: AI is getting so good surely bot games are good practice
[3:30:07] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG dude i only said stats paint a picture, which they do. The fact you become a condescending prick tells me everything i need to know about you xD (also, not even using mobalytics lmao you trolling)
[3:30:29] Arisutra: it's just showing those new players how to play Kappa
[3:30:35] DrogonBTW: AI BOTS JG NOW AND STEAL OBJS, LFASH OVER WALL TO STEAL
[3:30:38] iiNumb3rz: I will donate all of my channel points for you to play one quickplay game and try your heart out til they ff15. I have lots of points. We need this content.
[3:30:52] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG its a twitch comment section xD ofc i can also write essays lmao just stop it dude
[3:30:55] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ it's condescending to try and correct people when you have no more insight than "number bigger than other number" you deserve condescension this far out of your depth KEKW
[3:31:13] bushwookies: well obviously the game is fun when you win all the time KEKW
[3:31:26] DallinS: Do you think Red Kayn will be more viable now?
[3:31:35] Sejstargazin: @Praetor_GG Ima pull out of this thread, your point wasn't to learn smth new but to start a conflict
[3:31:42] FIurbz: Po is dead
[3:31:42] TorqueBandit: holy shit the gap there
[3:31:47] WingedChipmunk: LMAO
[3:31:56] iiNumb3rz: You should play Bek veth and try to never let the other jng get over 20 camps.
[3:32:06] Praetor_GG: @Sejstargazin my point was to correct misinformation KEKW
[3:32:09] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG 1) if u think tht was my point, u lack reading comprehension 2) wasnt even corrrecting lmao just raising points and discussing (which others eems to be able to do civil KEK 3) u showed ur collors, ure a waste of enegy now. Cya
[3:32:14] RaiohKyros: is this the first red kayn game this stream?
[3:32:15] Sejstargazin: @Praetor_GG not talking to you
[3:32:30] DemionDemon: @FIurbz his soul passed peacefully. he is now in the 40k universe.
[3:32:37] SublimeSoul: Kayn POGGERS
[3:32:40] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ back to Reddit for you cya! KEKW
[3:32:47] Arisutra: poor guys telling their homies they came up against an ex-pro player in quickplay and nobody believing them :(
[3:32:48] solidussovis: and we didn't want to look at that terrible record anyway
[3:32:50] iiNumb3rz: I honestly just need your commentary on this type of a game.
[3:32:59] Praetor_GG: @Sejstargazin notice how it saus @me and highlight my name LUL
[3:33:06] melkboer_: @Sejstargazin lol? pls show me how? I was civilly discussing with this point with another dude. But pls back your claim xD
[3:33:21] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG classic response ;)
[3:33:22] solidussovis: Mid is called "Lee Sin Support"
[3:33:32] matchapoundcake: are we really arguing over items  & stats in the chat rn
[3:33:36] Arisutra: LUL
[3:33:41] RaiohKyros: what's the story i missed it
[3:33:51] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ yeah I mean you Redditors are easy to spot they way you type so I'm sure you hear that alot KEKW
[3:33:55] lewhitehd69: darius is darius main monkaS
[3:33:57] reuvencl: DinoDance
[3:33:57] Sejstargazin: @melkboer_ Dude you're not interested in figuring out smth new and coming out of this discussion with a learning, nothing else to add
[3:33:58] NightShado81: @Santorin thoughts on the j4 buffs he feels good
[3:34:05] kennsey_: basically if u're behind and take it as second item , u will rarely chunk under the 35% health , or it would take u more risk to do it , if ur eve is behind it's a very bad situation but u shall always go for more AP and an item like banshee or a stormsurge is way better in my opinion
[3:34:08] iiNumb3rz: @raiohkyros were talking about some gigachad viking bullying some guys so they never q up again.
[3:34:27] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG never even been on reddit LMAO but keep the childish arguments ig xD
[3:34:28] TorqueBandit: peepoRiot FIGHT peepoRiot FIGHT peepoRiot FIGHT peepoRiot FIGHT
[3:34:34] solidussovis: Thats the Viking way Numberz

[3:35:05] melkboer_: @Sejstargazin ??? xD but back your claim then, dont just say it lmao i dont know when u started following it but read everything from the beginning xD
[3:35:11] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ the point is you type exactly like them, it's not a compliment
[3:35:14] kennsey_: less expanssive and most likely might bring u back to back
[3:35:34] Praetor_GG: you can always tell how lame someone is by how much they unironically type xD
[3:35:35] NightShado81: peeporiot
[3:35:35] Sejstargazin: @Praetor_GG ok i blocked both of you
[3:35:42] DallinS: they were snoopin around your red area btw if you didnt see it
[3:35:52] NightShado81: @NightShado81 Chatting can't type on mobile
[3:35:54] reuvencl: Playing ranked with your stream on the background is such an experience
[3:36:04] melkboer_: @Praetor_GG ah yes, i point out ur condescending remarks and then ur whole shtick is 'uh reddit uh uh', sure dude xD whatever you say, you're right ;)
[3:36:09] KillerB123: @Sejstargazin this thread is nuts lol
[3:36:14] Praetor_GG: @Sejstargazin why would you tell me? ok
[3:36:27] melkboer_: @Sejstargazin so u cant back any claim when faced with logic? Classic ;)
[3:36:29] matchapoundcake: y'all chill out
[3:36:42] kennsey_: yes well bursting 35% hp is  way easier than 65% for a behind eve , but it also depend on how fast u can come back , it's just too expensive
[3:36:46] iloumannaughti: what is happening in chat rn yall just wake up and choose to argue on a twitch stream? XD
[3:36:46] SupSensei: chronically online Chatting
[3:36:46] Bazeloth: @melkboer_ @Praetor_GG can u guys chill, get a room
[3:36:51] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ you talk like you spend most of your life on social media
[3:36:55] Arisutra: banshee's on a behind eve just turns her into a roaming ward
[3:36:58] NightShado81: bruh can we just DinoDance
[3:37:11] kennsey_: actually u might be right , but a behind eve is also a lost game , u gotta be very carful to not get behind
[3:37:19] melkboer_: @KillerB123 imagine just normally discussing items with a viewer and then 2 randoms hijack the convo and getting offended/condesceding. Twitch chat i guess :D
[3:37:20] FIurbz: @melkboer_ @Praetor_GG What are you opinions on the current politics?
[3:37:57] RaiohKyros: jarvan ahri were bot because evelynn bought banshee 2nd item
[3:37:58] melkboer_: @FIurbz Need to go to communism all the way. Everything for everyone!
[3:38:06] Praetor_GG: @melkboer_ you were matter-of-factly giving people bad info because you think you read it on website
[3:38:09] FIurbz: @melkboer_ Sick 'em @Praetor_GG

[3:39:03] Praetor_GG: never seen someone go so schizo over being disagreed with
[3:39:09] matchapoundcake: these chatters man donowall
[3:39:15] FIurbz: @melkboer_ I am serious, and don't call me shirley.
[3:39:34] Praetor_GG: maybe another xD will convince everyone you are credible and not losing your mind
[3:39:35] kennsey_: true , a very good eve gotta maximise the fast jungling and get KS , but i'm honestly not that good , so i go first strike and win my games with her x)
[3:39:36] melkboer_: @KillerB123 it's crazy. on top of that they're taking my sarcastic jokes even seriously. No hope left ig, still entertaining tho, up until some point
[3:39:58] NightShado81: BC first?
[3:40:05] morbidnumbskull: Darkin Kayn is called Rhaast @Santorin
[3:40:20] melkboer_: @FIurbz ah yes, start smth completely random for some reason! Good take! :D GL!

[4:58:10] GreenBaePackers: It will get better, stay consistent with it @santorin
[4:58:13] cavemandi: It will help for sure bro, just takes time
[4:58:19] GreenBaePackers: Not completely, but it'll help
[4:58:36] MayhemMikeyy: too can we see your mastery on champs
[4:58:41] 88_dohko: bicycle?
[4:58:47] GreenBaePackers: Have you been to a PT?
[4:58:56] GreenBaePackers: You rly should
[4:58:57] bbk15: mobility workouts is big
[4:59:06] jzipfel20: Stretching might not sound big but it’s really important
[4:59:07] ark0sic: i run roughly 60 km a week and my number one suggestion is to go see a physiotherapist before you have a problem
[4:59:28] tugwos: As someone with no cartilage and no ACL, if the knees don't get better, consider gel injections.  It really helps lube the knee and get it moving.  I'm still playing soccer because of them.
[5:00:31] ark0sic: hahaha bro you don't want my knees. currently have a torn meniscus from a stupid fall injury, but it's not bad enough for surgery so PT it is :)))
[5:00:33] Bradabing: just use a segway its totally the exact same thing
[5:01:52] tugwos: The gel is very similar to the natural fluids in the knee.  I was a ski racer for years, so my knees are totally f'd.  I tried a lot things first, and the gel is a lot better than surgery
[5:02:05] ark0sic: you're absolutely right, massive increased risk of arthritis later on in life after any knee surgery
[5:02:11] ark0sic: but also...it hurts and I want it to go away haha
[5:02:14] MyMindIsAFK13: I have switched to swimming instead. So much better for you. I ran marathons for years and my knees are shot.
[5:02:23] jzipfel20: Just have Kels carry you!!
[5:02:28] GreenBaePackers: Well it depends on the patient and a lot of other variables but I won't get into it lol @santorin
[5:02:45] Arisutra: "bowling" yeahhhhh
[5:03:10] Karimftw: man you're old
[5:03:18] Arisutra: i hurt my wrist "bowling" too
[5:03:22] bbk15: my man is falling apart
[5:03:27] Ctrlaltleet: as someone who's dealing with cts, i feel that
[5:03:29] Karimftw: oldge
[5:03:36] tugwos: @Arisutra was your vacuum broken?

[5:04:35] TorqueBandit: KEKW
[5:05:07] TorqueBandit: prove it, run back and forth in your room right now
[5:05:08] tugwos: Cross country ski.  Much easier on the knees
[5:05:11] GreenBaePackers: I too enjoy running away from my problems
[5:05:11] TorqueBandit: jk lol
[5:05:13] jzipfel20: Runners High!!
[5:05:20] CrimeSkeleton: i hate running but i feel similar about cycling
[5:05:41] TorqueBandit: ive never liked cardio, but I can see that, some great runs have felt great
[5:05:49] reuvencl: i cant find motivation to go to the gym
[5:05:55] Wild761: i like running but anything over 20km is not fun for me
[5:05:55] Praetor_GG: LUL
[5:05:57] Arisutra: i love running but without music, find hearing nature around me so peaceful
[5:06:12] LoudDerp: when the weather gets better I usually stick to tennis for cardio. Want to swap to swimming though.
[5:06:23] TorqueBandit: agreed
[5:06:32] GreenBaePackers: In med school there's lots of problems LUL
[5:06:53] GreenBaePackers: Speaking of I gotta get back to it, later bro
[5:07:00] TorqueBandit: yes and you get a nice routine, and routines can be great
[5:07:05] SublimeSoul: I love people watching at the gym :)
[5:07:10] GreenBaePackers: Good luck with the teletubbies santorinTele
[5:07:20] bbk15: gym is hosted
[5:07:28] sidequest76: there's a lot of similarities between going to the gym and grinding solo queue
[5:07:51] bbk15: goated* autocorrect
[5:08:04] ZealotOfLuna: since having the kids, I haven’t been able to run like I used to
[5:08:08] TorqueBandit: once I itched my ear next to a canal, and my earbud fell right in :) $70 to replace just 1.
[5:08:48] TorqueBandit: @SublimeSoul as long as you're also working out lol
[5:09:04] SublimeSoul: @TorqueBandit well yeah. obviously. haha
[5:09:12] TorqueBandit: @SublimeSoul awesome lol
[5:09:28] LoudDerp: sometimes I feel like some league players don't have eyes
[5:09:58] SublimeSoul: ori was about to ult at level 4 monkaW
[5:10:04] TorqueBandit: do you think Riot would ever implement AI into their game somehow? not their crappy AI currently but advanced generative AI?
[5:10:04] sidequest76: You do more damage in-game when you yell
[5:10:09] lubemila: santorinHype santorinHype
