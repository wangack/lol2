[0:13:53] Darkcyter: @calicoastal WB
[0:14:10] Darkcyter: @DarkSaionara What do you play these days? If it's okay to ask

[0:14:21] calicoastal: Hi @darkcyter kaypHello
[0:14:30] guiltyprawn: What do canadian farmers even farm? Moose and maple KappaCool
[0:14:37] MissUnfortuneK: Actually farming is more worth
[0:14:53] Sunnytinker: kaypWHAT
[0:15:06] atichii: as a Vayne main i feel happy when they take my tower now i can farm in peace :D
[0:15:28] 002chris002: Hello hello!
[0:15:34] jexuzd: Does victor still gain stacks of the lil spawns from the voidrugs or they fixed it?
[0:15:37] teya_ttv: hi kaypea! hope your day has been good so far <3
[0:15:53] jimbob_ywert: 3 waves = a kill, so if you‚Äôre like 50 CS over the enemy you‚Äôre basically 2 kills ahead
[0:15:57] jimbob_ywert: 4 kills ahead*
[0:16:01] jimbob_ywert: 3*
[0:16:03] FiveFM: It actually sounds moosem‚Ä¶
[0:16:09] jimbob_ywert: my math is not great today
[0:16:09] DarkSaionara: @Darkcyter I'm finishing Zelda TOTK, Super Mario, Sims, GTA V. A lot of types of games ahah
[0:16:13] pandathejack: I hate to farm I rather kill them kaypRiot
[0:16:25] Darkcyter: @DarkSaionara damn nice! hf
[0:16:35] dentoro: play vex next game pls
[0:16:41] DarkSaionara: @Darkcyter thank you! what about you?
[0:16:50] meep_: I'm a support main because I hate farming kaypAwkward

[0:16:54] imperialninja: kick some ass today  home slice
[0:17:08] liltotfuhyobih: what character would you recommend new players?
[0:17:12] DarkSaionara: @meep_ I relate to that
[0:17:14] jimbob_ywert: Farming is MAINLY important for exp rather than gold, someone who‚Äôs 2 levels ahead of you even an item down can literally kill you solo
[0:17:24] pandathejack: I always love me some lux games kaypSnipe
[0:17:29] saschatelepath: saschatelepath is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to KayPea's community! They've gifted a total of 30 in the channel!

[0:17:30] Darkcyter: @DarkSaionara Mostly RTS games, some fanmade pokemon games and occasionally tft double up because a nephew loves it
[0:17:42] atichii: liltotfuhyobih honestly play whatever you like. you have limited champs early so pick the cute one first lmao
[0:17:52] Gameym4nu: zup kay
[0:17:53] DarkSaionara: @Darkcyter niiice! have fun :)
[0:18:04] saschatelepath: im fine and how r u ?
[0:18:11] liltotfuhyobih: pick the cute one is a good advice fr
[0:18:45] J_to_the_jf: ya xp is more gold than xp
[0:18:52] atichii: liltotfuhyobih always FeelsOkayMan
[0:18:53] Sunnytinker: something easy
[0:18:55] J_to_the_jf: you're farming for that gold
[0:18:56] jimbob_ywert: oh yeah it‚Äôs your main source of gold (unless you‚Äôre an assassin) but I meant that EXP would be more important when you‚Äôre trying to get ahead
[0:19:01] ElminstersGhost: Garen
[0:19:03] ElminstersGhost: lol

[0:19:32] Seradotlol: @Darkcyter kaypCheer
[0:19:57] jexuzd: But nkt knowing the basics and playing braindead champions still makes you play bad
[0:19:59] jimbob_ywert: Aram introduced me (forced me) to play ZOE which is now my main!
[0:20:11] J_to_the_jf: it is true. Arams do be making you do randos
[0:20:21] ElminstersGhost: Aram got me to play Viktor and now I love him
[0:20:23] Hymuno: just do what i do, play a game, lose because the enemy champ was obviously op and not your fault, play that champ. Rinse and repeat
[0:20:37] Niomah: I ended up Mastery 6 on Galio because of ARAMs. Wouldn't have touched a tank as I feel I suck at them
[0:20:46] S17Master: ARAMs good to. It was how I first played Neeko and she became one of my favorite characters
[0:21:01] atichii: Arams are also faster
[0:21:01] its_slayyde: brand mid can suck bllz
[0:21:07] Divaleta: my boyfriend told me to pick the champion I thought was cutest and here I am a Seraphine main üòÇ
[0:21:22] Hymuno: and if you still lose then its obvious that the palyer you vs'd was hacking Kappa
[0:21:24] its_slayyde: i hate playing into brand
[0:21:31] amaan097: @Divaleta same but my cute champion is RAKAN AHAH
[0:21:36] jexuzd: Yo, galio is lowkey busted rn in my opinion
[0:21:42] J_to_the_jf: Riot would also not lose anything by adding a tutorial LUL
[0:21:47] its_slayyde: you dont see him often so if it isnt your normal matchup, it is easy to lose bcuz you play "worried"
[0:21:47] MissUnfortuneK: But you know what's the prob with farming? When you are pinging other lanes and they are ignoring the pings and giving the lead to your opponent mid then what???
[0:21:53] shedfirekid1: hello everyone
[0:21:53] its_slayyde: i do not want a fed brand haha
[0:22:01] Darkcyter: @Divaleta @Hymuno kaypHello kaypHello
[0:22:02] Divaleta: @amaan097 I love Rakan!
[0:22:06] gabb1790: Oof finally made it to the stream. Was binge watching your videos a while ago <3 <3 <3
[0:22:18] Hymuno: i wonder what the new bots will be like for learning the game
[0:22:28] Ripulpos: no gamba
[0:22:29] w0wzors: 9.5cs/m wtf is going on
[0:22:33] dr_z0idb3rg_: hey everyone kaypLove kaypLove kaypHello
[0:22:35] Divaleta: @darkcyter hiii (:
[0:22:44] shedfirekid1: I‚Äôve got my work cut out for me reminding you then kaypShame kaypShame
[0:22:44] Darkcyter: @dr_z0idb3rg_ kaypHello
[0:22:45] RadiantWisp: I kinda disagree with aram being a way to learn because of my experience. A huge component that aram has is positioning. A step closer - you are dead immediately and you don't know why (can't see what enemy champs do in league). I had much better learning by duos with friends and playing against bots
[0:22:48] atichii: i remmeber when Vayne came out. i was like peepoShy
[0:23:11] w0wzors: New year new you, lol
[0:23:29] ThirstyForJustice: That sounds like you should jungle! Creeps are lame, I just want ganks
[0:23:41] Darkcyter: @w0wzors @atichii kaypHello kaypHello
[0:23:44] som963: i am happy with gold I i am done this split and season will forever will be known as  a clusterfuck
[0:23:48] atichii: youre KayPeable FeelsOkayMan
[0:23:49] pandathejack: I went 3/1 with 300 CS on Orianna and got a S
[0:23:56] S17Master: @RadiantWisp It's less about learning how to play Summoner's Rift and more about just learning what a champion does because you have to play them and look at their abilities
[0:24:05] amaan097: OH MY GOD I REMEMBER KAYPEA WUKONG ERA
[0:24:08] amaan097: FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO
[0:24:10] Hymuno: jungle was kinda my 1st role because no one else would play it in normal games lol
[0:24:25] jexuzd: I think pokin the enemy while focusin the minions it feels so good mechanicly
[0:24:32] pandathejack: the game lasted 50 minutes
[0:24:40] ardaozturkben: Hielloo
[0:25:00] ardaozturkben: Have a great stream KP and chat!
[0:25:06] guiltyprawn: Cass really isn't dodging the 2nd part of E Nerdge
[0:25:09] shedfirekid1: if I can‚Äôt have a cannon then neither can you - KP to Cass
[0:25:36] RadiantWisp: @S17Master my point stands for that too, games vs bots gave me so much more space to actually have time to learn what's happening
[0:25:38] RadiantWisp: aram is a mess
[0:25:39] markella_andri: Hello kaypFlower
[0:25:42] xxxMAULxxx: did league change chat font, or is that just a EU setting?
[0:25:50] jexuzd: The best kind of couple, the roasting eachothers back ü§£
[0:25:55] Jaguar542: This is not KP playing, the player don't have demolish on therefore it can't be KP 4Head
[0:26:00] S17Master: Lucas just doesn't understand how games work outside his own elo LuL Down here you don't get to keep farming after 30m
[0:26:01] MissUnfortuneK: Easy peazy
[0:26:04] MissUnfortuneK: HSWP HSWP HSWP
[0:26:17] Hymuno: they changed the font, it was apparently to stop those giant boxes with crosses as names showing
[0:26:41] S17Master: @RadiantWisp But are you picking champions you don't play?
[0:26:41] pandathejack: I like the font
[0:26:52] Frozenfruit13: the font matches Korea now I believe
[0:26:58] Frozenfruit13: that was the reason for changing it
[0:27:00] jexuzd: That font looks so cursed to me
[0:27:08] Jaguar542: 4 mid man report the team?!?
[0:27:15] shedfirekid1: they sent the goon squad
[0:27:16] RadiantWisp: @S17Master yeah I did pick a variety to try
[0:27:30] guiltyprawn: Your goals in life are to have the most fun. That's normal. But to fck ppl up? That's some monkaS stuff
[0:27:40] Dryadem: is the Korean font now on every server ?
[0:27:42] manchild_vayne_player: finaly back home and cathing a kp stream leego
[0:28:02] teya_ttv: its on oce
[0:28:02] CrazyCortez: NA YES

[0:28:11] jexuzd: Im from LAN yes
[0:28:11] jimbob_ywert: EUW have it
[0:28:12] amaan097: SG - YES
[0:28:19] yuhenlyleee: PH - Yes
[0:28:20] SanjinoCrow: you are in euw? why tho?
[0:28:21] pandathejack: your team is doing pretty good, y'all will dominate team fights kaypUpsetti
[0:28:21] lilCACTUSS9: What was the question? @KayPea
[0:28:25] lilCACTUSS9: Sry i missed it
[0:28:27] ThirstyForJustice: The font update was to comply w/ WCAG requirements. Basically the old font couldn't meet AA (Disability/Accessibility) standards
[0:28:27] guiltyprawn: !eu
[0:28:28] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[0:28:36] SanjinoCrow: aint the lag hella bad?
[0:28:41] Jaguar542: it's not mid diff anymore. It's font diff!
[0:28:59] shedfirekid1: hit em with the juke
[0:29:06] karim_ali_: nice dodge
[0:29:08] jexuzd: The change the font but the can place a setting where you separete the language from text and voices, thanks riot
[0:29:10] KOPrince93: Hey there, how are you?
[0:29:12] lewhitehd69: Singing I wanna rock Singing and roll all night and party every day
[0:29:24] lewhitehd69: Dentge shit i fricked it up
[0:29:35] SanjinoCrow: =O welcome to the curling club then =D
[0:29:51] museguy: Today is my Friday, not mad about it
[0:29:54] MissUnfortuneK: EUNE changed the fonts as well
[0:30:02] pandathejack: that poor Cass
[0:30:04] RadiantWisp: his R on cd
[0:30:14] Jaguar542: insta ff LUL
[0:30:14] shedfirekid1: they are letting Ashe live holy heck
[0:30:14] RadiantWisp: unfortunate
[0:30:15] lewhitehd69: fuck that ashe played that well ratirlOH

[0:56:11] Rinniera: I think losing would feel a lot better if they were able to come up with some sort of system to make your lp be somewhat dependent on your performance too
[0:56:28] cooldudewithglasses: I also cannot deal with the fact that you put the fate of winning in the hands of 4 other people that you have never met before and you're forced to cooperate together impeccably in order to win
[0:56:35] calicoastal: I don't play ranked but I've been doing a lot more ARAM this season, it helps break up the bad games and gives me new characters to fuck around with. Keeps me from raging
[0:57:00] pandathejack: I hate feeling. ‚Äúwow I just won 3 games I'm scared to play again because I don't want to be in a 10-game loss streak‚Äù.

[0:58:59] Jaguar542: He don't know what lane you Main. One of my friends always queue up with fill.
[0:59:06] bodylikeyourdad: definitely will the total kill count at the end of game be odd or even
[0:59:38] Jaketin8: I mean that sentence of "if you main it, take it" kinda sounds like the mindset of the people who refuse to play any other role than their main, even if matchmaking puts them to it, the people who then force themselves into that role or just troll because you didnt give it to them, just to me sounds very much like those people thing to say
[0:59:38] YamiCF: here‚Äôs an idea for a goofy prediction, will anybody lane swap this game?

[1:27:07] jexuzd: Remember when it was a trashy √≠tem? Look at it now
[1:27:26] Jaketin8: @Lergaze Stay in range of enemy champs to charge auto attack, those charged autos give max hp, infinetly stackable max hp, meaning you can get like 10k hp on mage
[1:27:38] CrazyCortez: NOOOO
[1:27:44] Jaketin8: @xxxMAULxxx Went, that was the trick, but demonic no longer thing

[2:37:05] Ascht94: A "little" tilted? understatement of the year xD
[2:37:13] its_clamor: cut to Regina George saying "why are you obsessed with me"
[2:37:22] orbayy_: If it was a jungle duo I would understand, but across the opposite lane. That's a bit sad LUL
[2:37:23] Sunnytinker: @KayPea checked op.gg and surprisingly the ashe isnt duo with anyone but it looks like she always go like 4/12 kaypTroll
[2:37:24] el_cris_06: this ashe omg

[2:38:24] emi586: holaa peeaa mi amorrr como estas hermosaa? te amor toda mi vida, te mando un saludo desde argentina ojala algun dia me des bola
[2:38:30] Oakley85: @KayPea Could be she is salty with her ADC and just left her too. Ashe is great for roaming with ult since its so low cd
[2:38:33] MrsChristiena: Hello KayPea, hi Chat
[2:38:34] Smoothcollie: !l
[2:38:34] Nightbot: KayPea only understands English and wants to be able to interact with chat so please keep other languages to private messages and whispers. Thank you! kaypRainbow
[2:38:41] TheDylanBlack: nice play!
[2:38:49] orbayy_: They keep disrespecting the spatula LUL
[2:39:00] Sunnytinker: hehhe the outplay button Kappa

[2:39:08] Ecak01: What the heck this skin is so cute
[2:39:10] damndani_: you have all the best skins
[2:39:27] NightSpiritFae: no need to click Samira ult, it Will be back when she gets her S thing
[2:39:40] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea Id be willing to bet ashes just does this roam mid shit every gamE. I ran into on that did the same shit to me mid the other day
[2:39:58] Oakley85: Ive seen supports leave adc's before minions even get to lane lol. This game os so toxic sometimes
[2:40:24] MrsChristiena: omg
[2:40:24] CipherAdminShady: Just wondering when was the last time you've spent money on League?
[2:40:35] Jefrienaiter: Stare
[2:40:38] chalender21: Just type
[2:40:40] chalender21: LUL
[2:40:42] Gossamer_DT: Only toxic players need to ping more than once :P
[2:40:44] Smoothcollie: Well it‚Äôs Lucian, king of the early bot lane.  With milio R, Ashe R does nothing = samira does kinda notihing? Lucian can just dash away when milio ultra
[2:40:44] WaystedMined: nikkikFacepalm Use our system, just not too much
[2:40:46] damndani_: RIOOOOOOT
[2:40:50] FiveFM: kaypWHAT
[2:41:18] SpookyPuff_: kelsey continuously trying to aggresively smash pings then gently and calmly making me so much laugh
[2:41:22] Jefrienaiter: Prediction btw?
[2:41:24] kenadams03: the increase the duration so like 5 seconds then 7 then 9 (numbers are an example and not an actual representation)
[2:41:28] kenadams03: they*
[2:41:30] J0LLYR0GER: But Kaypea you might hurt he feelings of an innocent flower if u ping too much
[2:41:31] Ecak01: I feel like you're getting more tilted from not being able to chat than when there is chat LUL
[2:41:43] orbayy_: Imagine this game with voicechat.
[2:41:49] chalender21: I always forget to deafen chat so I end up watching people flame every match
[2:41:56] Gossamer_DT: as a toxic player the ping restrictions have completely cured my need to ping I just find other ways :D
[2:42:07] Rinniera: Muting my chat is one of the best decisions Ive made recently lol just way less tilted seeing the nonsense people type
[2:42:12] Smoothcollie: @orbayy_ No. Don‚Äôt even imagine that, please kaypLUL
[2:42:16] chalender21: @gossamer_dt next level is emoting LUL
[2:42:47] nosmile_kyle: bro in-game chat is cancer, i'm chat restricted and it makes the game so much better
[2:42:47] Blondii3y: I dont think anyone would join just like in OW
[2:42:50] caprica5: I would absolutely hate if they added vc
[2:42:52] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea Does executing a minion with Q extend the max range?
[2:42:54] orbayy_: @Smoothcollie Like imagine the guy that just reached its final limit and just burst out on that mic. LUL
[2:42:54] Ascht94: well it did work with exh LUL
[2:42:54] FiveFM: Drat
[2:42:55] ItsAMoll: it would be easier with VC, tbh its the only team game that doesnt have it. valorant seems to do fine with VC
[2:43:03] Smoothcollie: These days? Like almost everyone tbh. And I HATE that
[2:43:08] padtime: personally would never use VC in lol i even disable msg due to how toxic people are lately
[2:43:18] CipherAdminShady: normal SS for ADC tbh
[2:43:23] nosmile_kyle: @ItsAMoll ehhhh idk Hasanabi got called the f-slur within 30 seconds once on Valo VC
[2:43:35] caprica5: @ItsAMoll And Valorant is toxic af
[2:43:35] YourFaveCarb: Val does NOT do fine with vc. Do you know how many times i have had to report people for hate speech and harassment? Val is SO BAD
[2:43:38] Smoothcollie: @itsamoll It would be even more toxi-er than it‚Äôs now.
[2:43:52] kenadams03: just sick lucas on them kaypAnnoyed
[2:44:01] caprica5: Yea, that is another thing. Dealing with people as a girl
[2:44:08] nosmile_kyle: i had a friend who was a girl once, who said watch this, and in AOL chat room typed "i'm a girl" Her screen got SWAMPED in DMs instantly
[2:44:08] Smoothcollie: @kenadams03 Haaaaaaaaa kaypLUL
[2:44:10] SpookyPuff_: thats true, the first thing im doing playing valorant is disabling voicechat
[2:44:10] J0LLYR0GER: Voice chat in league would basically be like the old 360 Call of duty lobbies.
[2:44:23] chalender21: @nosmile_kyle hasan is straight, no?
[2:44:42] nosmile_kyle: @chalender21 yes
[2:44:48] laketittykakka: As a jg main, I'll pass on the voicechat lmao
[2:44:53] orbayy_: I think it would be a lot of trash talk
[2:44:56] laketittykakka: I've still got a bit of sanity left in me!
[2:45:02] BartonLua: you'd sometimes get more hate for not using it
[2:45:03] xxxMAULxxx: I mean doesn't League have a chat function... Most don't use it.
[2:45:06] vitoquartz: voice modifiers should be a thing
[2:45:13] ItsAMoll: @Smoothcollie i guess my question is what makes vc in valorant or cs go different than vc in lol?
[2:45:15] ThePeePuddle: Voice chat would absolutely deter me from playing even more tbh
[2:45:16] DXSMOKINGMONKEY: League? Toxic? Nooooooooo
[2:45:19] Hymuno: riot just needs to match make so there is 1 girl on each team Kappa
[2:45:21] nosmile_kyle: bro as a white guy it's still toxic lol, if you don't have a difference for them to shit on they'll just shit on play style
[2:45:23] YourFaveCarb: LEague only has vc for premade groups
[2:45:24] FiveFM: Plus the LoL community is renowned throughout gaming as one of the most toxic! Not worth the risk!
[2:45:26] caprica5: @YourFaveCarb @YourFaveCarb I ended up uninstalling Valorant because of how toxic it is and the people harassing you over vc for trying to learn the game
[2:45:27] Smoothcollie: I get why people want voice chat. But just not. No. Think outside your box, please Sadge
[2:45:40] nosmile_kyle: @caprica5 i auto mute VC in Valo
[2:45:43] imagineyourself_: you deal no damage
[2:45:43] gkotsiberry: much love from Greece
[2:45:53] Gossamer_DT: how dare you say there are douches in LOL this is an institution of the upper most caliber class of players in the world!
[2:45:54] nosmile_kyle: and if people abuse pings i'll mute their pings and emotes too
[2:45:55] kenadams03: why'd elise do that much dmg?
[2:46:12] nosmile_kyle: @kenadams03 prob full lethal after Heartsteel?
[2:46:30] kingdomofblue: that spider is getting big, triggers my phobia lol
[2:46:36] orbayy_: the question you should be asking why is anyone building tank items stronger than the dmg builder
[2:46:48] ËñõÂèÆÊ†ºÁöÑË≤ì: elise so op
[2:46:54] kenadams03: she has heartsteel and shadowflame?
[2:46:57] Karimftw: kaypSpy
[2:46:57] kenadams03: HUH
[2:46:59] TurtleIam: we to toxic
[2:47:05] ragtimediddly: So... judging from the grey screen as soon as I tune in... games not going well?
[2:47:05] QuazarFC: this commuinty would be horrible for TS
[2:47:06] TurtleIam: too*
[2:47:07] SpookyPuff_: will tank elise top become a new meta? pls no
[2:47:12] nicetry7777: Which grades exists in lol?
[2:47:14] QuazarFC: voicechat^
[2:47:16] nosmile_kyle: they'll never ban people who spend money, capitalism bb /s
[2:47:24] YourFaveCarb: yeah riot either isn't interested in policing their community, it's too expensive, or both
[2:47:32] TurtleIam: especially if you are not a white male LUL
[2:47:52] Greedion: But Kelsie do you think the Valorant community is that different from LOL?
[2:47:53] Gossamer_DT: riot will never do that they want cash and players like that pay for crap its a bad cycle
[2:47:58] nosmile_kyle: Riot's parent company don't give a fuck what Westeners think I feel
[2:48:02] orbayy_: The problem is people just buy a new account for a dollar or two. So they will get away with anything either way cause they just dont care, eyy i just buy a new account
[2:48:04] vitaincerta: is there any competetive game with non-toxic chat and voice chat
[2:48:09] kingdomofblue: ashe flashing from impending doom haha
[2:48:21] nosmile_kyle: @vitaincerta nope. Have you met sports gamblers in bars?
[2:48:24] Greedion: I mean there voice chat is not as toxic as we imagine voice chat in League
[2:48:25] FIurbz: @vitaincerta league of legends
[2:48:35] Smoothcollie: @itsamoll Basically what Kels is saying now, I‚Äôm 100 % in this with her. The positives < negatives. Fix toxicity, then add voice chat
[2:48:38] FiveFM: Bleh-hehhehheh-heeeeh!
[2:48:43] vitaincerta: @FIurbz Kappa
[2:48:50] FIurbz: MiniK
[2:48:56] nosmile_kyle: Burh you think LoL is bad go to a bar during WNBA games and what the absolute degenerates scream b/c they have 100 riding on a pre-season game

[2:49:31] chalender21: Riot would need to invent a speech modifier to root out cuss words like in The Good Place lmao
[2:49:35] HSharkie: HSharkie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 63 months! 
[2:49:43] HSharkie: kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:49:51] orbayy_: Neither is CS VC LUL
[2:50:50] RadiantWisp: if you harass minorities and you are muted out of the voice chat, that means voice chat is no longer an improvement for team coms
[2:50:54] ragtimediddly: Valorant would be a lot better without the Overwatch element
[2:51:06] RadiantWisp: I can just never have voice chat on, and that's the same as being muted out
[2:51:12] imagineyourself_: stop trolling
[2:51:17] 1meatsqueezer: hows your climb going? i went from 95lp e3 to a 7 game losing streak......
[2:51:26] BabaaBear17: as a gay man I‚Äôd say apex has the best vc. I‚Äôve been playing since the game came out and have only ever been called the F slur once
[2:51:30] FIurbz: nice cannon q
[2:51:33] RadiantWisp: do little spiders get stunned in cage?
[2:51:50] xSpootymanx: xSpootymanx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[2:52:21] VoltricZ: thank you thank you  I used to play ADC and jungle,  do you have any idea of the state of either of those roles?

[2:52:43] kenadams03: you need win :)
[2:52:47] Darkcyter: @HSharkie 63 kaypHYPERS WB
[2:52:51] RadiantWisp: although as a sup would be nice to com to carry
[2:52:56] ragtimediddly: ADC in the dumpster, Jungle always the scapegoat for a loss

[2:53:54] VoltricZ: @ragtimediddly so what you're saying is I'm fucked either way kaypWHAT
[2:53:57] kenadams03: where'd brand go
[2:54:08] kenadams03: @Darkcyter kaypHello
[2:54:09] YourFaveCarb: i thought for sure they were gonna get rid of Heartsteel this season
[2:54:12] YourFaveCarb: it's so broken
[2:54:22] ItsAMoll: @Smoothcollie how do you fix toxicity tho?
[2:54:27] reginaphalange00: @Darkcyter yee hehe
[2:54:28] RadiantWisp: is milio good? haven't seen him in a long long time
[2:54:33] Ecak01: Tanks in this game are so egregiously overpowered
[2:54:40] YourFaveCarb: @ItsAMoll that's a very big question.
[2:54:52] kenadams03: jgl
[2:55:18] Ecak01: I feel like if you have an unkillable amount of health or gain that much back you should not be able to 2 shot someone, not even the squishies
[2:55:29] vitoquartz: it will now cause level difference is shrinking
[2:55:34] Oakley85: How much AP do you have now
[2:55:36] VoltricZ: thanks, I'll try to focus my energy more on jungling then
[2:56:05] RadiantWisp: i feel adc is better because with voidgrubs junglers are more dependent on team members, while adc can hug tower and scale
[2:56:18] Ecak01: Heartsteel lux again?
[2:56:57] YourFaveCarb: i feel like adc has been in a bad spot since i started playing lol
[2:57:01] Galetea: i think they need to reevaluate how heartsteel interacts with some champs
[2:57:08] gkotsiberry: where is your lipstick from?
[2:57:11] maurrigane: Ad carry need the old items, the ones with 100 ad
[2:57:33] RadiantWisp: who let her cook
[2:57:36] vitaincerta: back to Tank Veigar I guess
[2:57:40] TeddyUrsaGaming: kaypComfy  how much did she do?
[2:57:53] chalender21: we need a number reveal
[2:57:54] YourFaveCarb: we can't see the damage graph :(
[2:57:55] chalender21: LUL
[2:57:58] SpookyPuff_: thats bc her dmg is scaling with enemies current hp, so it can still be huge w/o ap items
[2:58:03] Ecak01: Bring season 6 back lmao
[2:58:19] Smoothcollie: @itsamoll Imma whisper you, let's not spamm the chat with this kaypHappea
[2:58:28] orbayy_: Just give me back S3 back...
[2:58:32] chalender21: Its their team
