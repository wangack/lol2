[2:56:28] pidgeon35: @yallz ye
[2:56:31] pidgeon35: it s good
[2:56:32] milky_lefty: my problem with aatrox is he cant solo carry unlike most toplaners and on top of that his playstyle is so unconventional and uncomfortable no matter the build
[2:56:39] psychoreforged: who wins, late game naafiri or lategame aatrox
[2:56:48] pidgeon35: @psychoreforged i think naafiri
[2:56:50] lilgrim27: but hes such a lil guy
[2:56:54] weeder_smurfacc: u need serpents fang
[2:57:01] shinsora_: @milky_lefty that has to be because u are new to aatrox
[2:57:02] yallz: @pidgeon35 even if its good ivern never gonn be above 0.5%  pick
[2:57:05] raphhha53: @milky_lefty no champ can solo carry imo..

[2:58:42] TheVip3rR: smodla is useless
[2:58:43] shinsora_: @milky_lefty 80k points is definitely not enough to feel comfortable and understand aatrox. Even if u think u know him u definitely dont and when you feel uncomfortable with him thats a more reason to it
[2:58:46] el_rey313: caps and upset pffff

[3:04:53] Squizik_: who the fuck is zivia
[3:04:55] cheerios20203: Why is smolder a guarantee pick ban in pro play?
[3:05:08] shinsora_: @milky_lefty that seems to be the problem aatrox is a champ where u need experience when ur enemy is good so u know how to play good in specific situations instinctively and also actively
[3:05:25] shazzeeeee: @Squizik_ sivir
[3:05:36] Squizik_: @cheerios20203 is it actually 100% presence?
[3:05:37] IsoMSS: unlucky Clueless
[3:05:38] elephantworld: he is like adc kassadin

[3:06:36] Komlin111: what has better pickrate stats? ugg or lol analytics
[3:06:37] milky_lefty: @shinsora_ maybe but thats why i dont play mechanically hard champs i play shit like, jax gwen morde, champs that i dont need to know that much abt, but still i know my combos i know my laning phase pretty well its just that late game is a disaster always
[3:06:41] whymypissbchunky: Yone's adhd activated

[3:07:26] danypose10: this need to be the same briar that yesterday die with malph on tower
[3:07:27] HateSpawn: @Komlin111 use lolalytics
[3:07:35] Bnadryl: Yone players are the same guys that copied sasuke's personality in school
[3:08:15] salega96: @Komlin111 lolalytics delta winrate is the best stat you can find
[3:08:15] HateSpawn: @milky_lefty play a scaling champ
[3:08:21] salega96: delta 1 and delta 2
[3:08:25] shinsora_: @milky_lefty it comes with the time and perhaps watch some fundamentals videos about mid to late game
[3:08:32] 0iyasser: what are you going this game?

[3:09:51] PColina: yes he does
[3:09:59] elephantworld: but he does 😭
[3:10:20] c0bra112: he scales the same way nasus scales
[3:10:23] PColina: smolder is literally a scaling champ wdym
[3:10:24] pepegalegend27: smolder is a champ that only executes YEP
[3:10:26] c0bra112: no range and u die
[3:10:27] IsoMSS: 700 stacks should be gg, thats insane
[3:10:30] arsim4: Okay then lets do it :D Smolder scales better than any other adc :D
[3:10:37] GetPaved: Smolder has a True daamge execute permanetly so ppl think since he has all the kills it was him
[3:10:44] yamato2113: @arsim4 lol no he doesn't
[3:10:44] sherthelock: IS this illégal matchup
[3:10:46] MandaDHS: Helo

[3:10:51] Nightbot: https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=naayil
[3:10:55] ultimateiq: if he really had 700 stacks he could sell his items and go tank and 1v9
[3:10:57] yamato2113: tw scales better
[3:10:58] elephantworld: smolder has free elder dragon late game lmao
[3:11:01] yamato2113: vayne scales better
[3:11:01] Splitshot_Is_Here: Nerdge he's a scaling champion because he has scales on his skin
[3:11:03] ninjabanana9: @IsoMSS yeah normally you cn't win against any scaling champ with that kind of stacks

[3:11:17] mozgamez: @ultimateiq Clueless
[3:11:19] whymypissbchunky: Im a emerald toplane player but put me on smolder in chall i 1v9
[3:11:22] Komlin111: @Splitshot_Is_Here renektoy modCheck

[3:11:57] whymypissbchunky: Im dead serious
[3:12:16] Squizik_: problem is smolder has the highest winrate for any adc this patch after senna and vayne nerfs, his winrate is around 54% diamond+ which is insane for a new champ that everyone is spamming for fun

[3:17:23] rionagh07: briar wintrading xdd
[3:17:24] milky_lefty: @Komlin111 because she had a toxic unbalanced build that was suicide bomber into full heal lethality
[3:17:26] whymypissbchunky: Do you think they will eventually  add a 3rd windshiter
[3:17:36] syfhero: briar tunnel haha
[3:17:37] IsoMSS: @whymypissbchunky probably not
[3:17:43] Komlin111: @Caendred briar is pure feast or famine, I dont think her w is good game design
[3:17:53] 0iyasser: @whymypissbchunky you mean Taliyah?
[3:18:08] ultimateiq: @whymypissbchunky they added nilah and k'sante
[3:18:28] whymypissbchunky: Yeah but they aint got the same vibe as the wind bros
[3:18:29] haunteed123: his E 30% damage
[3:18:33] milky_lefty: that "nerf" it was really more of an adjustment while her w healing does scale with health now she fits way more into her role of a tanky healing bruiser that heads straight for the enemy and fights till shes dead
[3:18:45] labidiomart98: @Komlin111 she is a vmpire so it makes sense
[3:18:54] elBoss44: @IsoMSS we already have 1 sword and 2 swords with half of his moves are stolen from zoro ... if they're are gonna do a 3rd one it better be zoro with the entire glory of his 3 swords
