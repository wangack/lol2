[0:22:49] lucasloki: korra is awesome, but all season are too short
[0:22:50] bbqroastpork: appa was the best character

[0:23:08] Stratosphere987: My only gripes on Korra is they didn't lean into the themes *enough* imo, and also Season 4 just..... eh? I didn't like it
[0:23:10] caloy468: korra's story was definitely less straightforward and i didnt hate it
[0:23:12] mrkIck__: 🤞🔥

[0:23:50] ThaMightyAtlas: yes?

[0:23:55] lucasloki: no filler
[0:23:55] MisterBlues: Agreege Sadge
[0:23:57] youngsterjoeyp: they replaced the "fun" with the love triangle drama

[0:24:20] Nepthien: Korra was going through it constantly lol
[0:24:23] watchgocoding: 3 season was good
[0:24:24] DOZER_52: when they make the in-between  animated series of after the war should be nice
[0:24:24] Stratosphere987: @Sydeon my friend and I were talking, and he said it better than I, but it was basically like, Season 1 was all Benders vs Non-Benders and then after Amon was revealed it kind of just... fizzled out and didn't really continue? Like that kind of civil unrest doesn't go away
[0:24:26] Zephyran01: Unalaq shouldve been the final villain
[0:24:28] taytay605: I mean hes not wrong
[0:24:32] Foelley: The fun episodes in ATLA also explained the history, so I think the worldbuilding helped a ton
[0:24:37] denimonyo: i thought appa was on your shirt lmao mbmb
[0:24:39] itsmepattyg: the antagonists were FIRE

[0:53:55] markewry: yea
[0:53:59] Krionking: Its better for it to be something you like rather than more accurate
[0:54:07] Vivaro89: IamJerez Looking

[0:54:12] Copperhead228: Oh wow, that is looking nice!

[0:54:58] Setsuna_GN: change the feet back to black also
[0:54:59] BlackFireCowboy: hmm desaturate the thighs a bit more
[0:55:01] bibbitypop: Close
[0:55:02] markewry: the suittt
[0:55:03] YaBoiii: the thighs are just a teensy bit lighter then the main body suit
[0:55:03] BlackFireCowboy: and I think you're there
[0:55:10] eternalking20531: i like that
[0:55:14] Setsuna_GN: don't forget to change the shoes back to black
[0:55:15] vladbagbuss: oh we cooking
[0:55:18] youngsterjoeyp: yeah and then the shoulders go back to black
[0:55:20] franky47: yeah shoes black & shoudlers black then i think it's set
[0:55:22] YaBoiii: But I think you want to lighten the thighs rather than darkening the bodysuit
[0:55:36] markewry: why is this so much fun
[0:55:37] spooningyodabrb: can we go brighter white?
[0:55:40] NisperTV: I love this bringing the lurkers out
[0:55:53] StreamElements: Come join the discord to get to know myself and the community better off stream! https://discord.gg/5R2PWZp
[0:56:06] brentneyspears: 9.5
[0:56:10] itsmepattyg: yeah like why
[0:56:10] pxrpleh4ze: is there no 9.5
[0:56:16] BlackFireCowboy: desaturate it on the thing a bit more maybe
[0:56:16] kusou: shoulders may go better in black too
[0:56:33] Setsuna_GN: yeah i think shoulders should stay black
[0:56:34] mueslimissi: that’s hilarious that there’s no in between
[0:56:36] mcflurrymac: is it possible to get the exact RBG in a program or something?
[0:56:40] BlackFireCowboy: like more towards the white than purple at 9 brightness
[0:56:42] Bappo: yeah i think 10 i too light
[0:56:43] mcflurrymac: but nvm thats too much work
[0:56:45] franky47: i think shoulders black and it's good to go
[0:56:46] youngsterjoeyp: 9 is better than 10
[0:56:52] franky47: maybe shoudlers black looks bad though idk
[0:56:57] trynafindcursed: hmm
[0:57:11] youngsterjoeyp: looks pretty solid to me if there isnt a better hair style to match
[0:57:11] YaBoiii: Usually when you adjust the brightness you have to readjust the color to compensate. Not ideal though lol
[0:57:20] DOZER_52: i like how half of tekken is always just customization
[0:57:21] markewry: is that a flower on her head
[0:57:22] Setsuna_GN: hmmm
[0:57:26] YaBoiii: Definitely getting there!!
[0:57:28] itsmepattyg: other than the thighs, it looks SPOT ON
[0:57:35] Setsuna_GN: can you change the socks part of the boots to the pale purple?
[0:57:40] mueslimissi: can you make the hair fade more ?
[0:58:28] Vivaro89: lookSideways
[0:58:34] gelixyyy: helloooo sydeonnn ^_^

[0:59:10] XrypticPyro: @Vivaro89 @NisperTV Kissahomie
[0:59:10] markewry: damn it lets go back to gray
[0:59:12] BlackFireCowboy: saturation is how far up and down you go
[0:59:18] GramTokersDoinkula: could be a material issue. like too metallic looking
[0:59:25] NisperTV: @XrypticPyro Kissahomie
[0:59:26] FloYork: i might have to buy tekken now
[0:59:29] markewry: yuh it shines
[0:59:29] spooningyodabrb: drag it a bit lower in the color thing? but keep it at 9
[0:59:44] YaBoiii: The contrast is now really good
[0:59:48] markewry: yea
[0:59:49] Setsuna_GN: i'm not sure you can make it any better unless you change the color completely
[0:59:53] mcflurrymac: if you get the customization down the tekken plays itself
[0:59:53] StreamElements: Check out the Alienware x16 Gaming Laptop here! https://load.gg/AWSydeon_x16
[0:59:58] NisperTV: that looks pretty damn good
[1:00:00] Stevo8888: it's kinda close
[1:00:01] BlackFireCowboy: honestly I think it's close enough
[1:00:09] shinmalice: yeah, the middle body part should be darker now
[1:00:19] YaBoiii: if I ran into this i think I can put this together. You might want to try the other hair you hate again (I agree its shitty!!)
[1:00:22] Setsuna_GN: oh
[1:00:27] spooningyodabrb: looks good

[1:13:25] shinmalice: black looks better
[1:13:27] markewry: less
[1:13:28] Setsuna_GN: i guess if you wanted to replicate the monowire, you could add the hand light effect aura
[1:13:29] trynafindcursed: what do u call the thing flying at her back
[1:13:31] itsmepattyg: who knew the the customization in this game would go this HARD
[1:13:41] YaBoiii: Black is less "accurate" but it translates a lot better visually
[1:13:47] ThaMightyAtlas: TekkenTime

[1:13:58] KatyParry_FGC: tag 2 customize was WAY better
[1:14:00] detroit_drew: you mean tekken ball, right?
[1:14:07] Kengou12: Tekken 6 customization was the best one
[1:14:07] computer_321: who is the anime character?
[1:14:07] markewry: this is how u use your fashion sense for gaming
[1:14:09] shinmalice: yeah Tekken 6 has best customization in Tekken
[1:14:10] kiimbro: is the tournament who can make the best skin?
[1:14:11] DiggsAnomaly: Wish it was on the level of soul caliber customization
[1:14:11] YaBoiii: The last Soul Calibur is what you actually want
[1:14:15] VanTheShinKKage: @katyparry_fgc I think the devs are working on it
[1:14:16] LinguineBobini: tekken ball is the true competitive format
[1:14:21] beatlemnkyhuman: they going to charge us for more customization and we’re going to pay CarlSmile
[1:14:21] Morals_TK: tekken ball is lit
[1:14:23] 7xplayer: T6 was the god at that
[1:14:24] yeojinnoona: i've seen more clips of how amazing this game's customization is than the actual gameplay
[1:14:25] VanTheShinKKage: coding is hard
[1:14:35] Kengou12: Tekken ball is so goofy KEKW
[1:14:36] KatyParry_FGC: @VanTheShinKKage  i hope so, 7 & 8 you can feel the limits a bit too strong

[2:06:07] ThaMightyAtlas: PERFECK
[2:06:09] joZeroHero: Tekken teaches learning, you can not fairly expect yourself to be good at this point
[2:06:23] UrGirlsH1deOut: nice perfect
[2:06:24] jovicchi: i wasnt thinking actually
[2:06:39] ThaMightyAtlas: nt

[2:07:23] jovicchi: wasnt me CAUGHT
[2:07:26] sinroth: i get the stakes of tomorrow, but you shouldn't let it discourage your from playing afterwards.  People will talk shit for like a day, but then no one cares anymore, and you can keep getting better. I bet it happens with pros all the time too.
[2:07:27] lucasloki: you are suffer for antecipation.. is not how it works...
[2:07:40] lucasloki: suffering*
[2:07:48] AmazingChest: it's true, what someone has for breakfast can affect their whole tournament. and people like to ignore any success up to that point. fgc is fickle
[2:07:50] jovicchi: @lucasloki huh
[2:07:54] Tigusan: I also have trouble dealing with judgment
[2:08:18] UrGirlsH1deOut: @lucasloki exactly
[2:08:36] Jaymanji: bruh Fighting games are such an equal playing field. IDK why theres a distinction besides the level of representation on stage and events
[2:08:47] FruityCaptain: i think you are actually better than me at alisa, i just cheese with her you actually use her moves right
[2:09:02] jovicchi: people always want conflict between groups like yalls
[2:09:13] jovicchi: like get a lofe
[2:09:17] jovicchi: life even
[2:09:28] Tigusan: I think you're gonna have a lot of fun playing with friends
[2:09:28] notjoshiko: you do you and whatever it takes to improve. I'd say ignore the shiet talkers but easier said than done lol
