[1:55:35] meatboy6907: @MortalityDoesStuff so banning tiktok is basically economic warfare
[1:55:43] BeastlyMcBeast: Some of us have given up on the tax bracket

[1:55:53] kosherpotatoes: nah im saying what made it go up is inflation. they have to adjust stuff like that for inflation.
[1:55:53] Treebeard64: ^
[1:55:54] MortalityDoesStuff: @meatboy6907 that doesn't mean anything because they make revenue by having apps hosted on their services
