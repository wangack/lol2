[1:26:42] phelixdacat00: when they removed the san francisco servers, i quit.  Playing on 60 ping vs people on 15 ping was just ridiculous

[1:27:16] ScarletRainMk1: mom has too busy of an onlyfans
[1:27:22] ScarletRainMk1: wont stop uploading content
[1:27:37] JBP7: its because they are better at floating point operations
[1:28:05] PillarofFlesh: I need to get a new cpu Sadge
[1:28:15] Warhog__: nah, gpu's are 4x I think
[1:28:25] PillarofFlesh: nut that means I need to get a new mobo as well
[1:28:26] rosivagyok: also gpus are much better at paralell computations
[1:28:27] Maeg: you can get someones browser to mine with the gpu so its not necessarily wrong
[1:29:03] ScarletRainMk1: wings gonna play dragons dogma 2 when it comes out?
[1:29:27] Maeg: basicly its scamming users
[1:29:31] PillarofFlesh: infect others pcs. Have them mine for you
[1:29:39] ScarletRainMk1: its a seperate story entirely
[1:29:53] vonrazzle: Yeah i would actually say start on dogma 2
[1:30:07] DirigaazMaster: im fucking hyped for DD2
[1:30:18] ScarletRainMk1: but DD1 is one of my favorites of all time, for all its jank.
[1:30:28] zeddie_: wangs, fave champ to play?
[1:30:38] DirigaazMaster: The vocations were so fucking fun
[1:30:55] vonrazzle: dd1 was like dark souls, their own engine and setting and combat style
[1:30:56] ScarletRainMk1: its a 10/10 game masquerading as 5/10 game
[1:31:03] vonrazzle: felt janky but fun
[1:31:35] ScarletRainMk1: it has lore and a normal medieval fantasy storyline

[1:32:04] CaptainAmeric0: The ruined king ❤️
[1:32:07] dadminty: bro zed is not a champion
[1:32:08] mehits: Zed has got giga nerfs
[1:32:14] JBP7: didnt august say they intentionally keep him weak because they think his gameplay is toxic
[1:32:17] dadminty: he does negative damage even at lvl 6
[1:32:17] ScarletRainMk1: so it feels really jank when you first start and it has weird design choices like your stat growth being entirely tied to whatever class you had on when you leveled up
[1:32:25] copajoe: 49.6% wr, not great but not terrible
[1:32:28] dadminty: he can’t even kill ads that well
[1:32:41] waynekerrishere: teemo angle
[1:32:43] WheresTheBaby: supports are even 1 shotting adcs in this meta
[1:32:48] RatmanForever: zac!
[1:32:49] thikona: zac?
[1:33:11] Psychoserra: lulu can counter zed though. would be silly for him to pick zed into that.
[1:33:26] dadminty: ya late game it’s fine I’m saying his lane phase is so weak it’s hard to get to late game
[1:33:29] DirigaazMaster: @ScarletRainMk1 The stat growth was probably my only real dislike of the game. Oh you want to do the most damage as any physical? better be assassin for 100 levels
[1:33:43] Alenezno: you good Panth is op
[1:34:03] dadminty: that sounds like an awful matchup for you
[1:34:04] Maeg: Chat was right
[1:34:06] dadminty: gl
[1:34:23] Psychoserra: @dirigaazmaster I agree with that completely, that was really janky
[1:34:24] dadminty: maybe Zac is just a dog player
[1:34:25] Maeg: zac is so busted he may even sup
[1:34:29] ScarletRainMk1: @DirigaazMaster right? or you want to play as magick archer and not hit like a nerf gun? better grind 100levels in sorc
[1:34:57] ScarletRainMk1: at least it was partially mitigated by BBI weapons bumping you beyond the damage threshold anywya
[1:34:59] DirigaazMaster: @Maeg Hybrid vocations slapped so fucking hard
[1:35:18] dadminty: karma is busted
[1:35:25] ssantiagodom: uyou won last game?
[1:35:26] Psychoserra: @scarletrainmk1 that was the most annoying for me too, I liked the magic archer a lot but I played 95% of it as a sorc
[1:35:53] SmokeeTheBandit: whats god tier?
[1:35:54] vonrazzle: in an arpg
[1:36:01] ScarletRainMk1: @Psychoserra literally what held me back from playing magick acher because playing as sorc for so long was so boring
[1:36:07] JBP7: if its that imba maybe just break from it until patch?
[1:36:12] 65656565: yeah im playing falconer
[1:36:16] ScarletRainMk1: and i couldnt jsut swap to assassin cuz woops leveled 50 times as sorc lmfao
[1:36:22] Psychoserra: yeah for sure, wasn’t really worth it for me.
[1:36:25] vonrazzle: when they say god tier do they mean, can insta kill everything end game and the mid ones take 2 hits to kill everything end game?
[1:36:36] SmokeeTheBandit: im doing explosive ballista falconer

[2:59:45] SRRW95: Warcrimes are more established for POW
[2:59:55] cptsunnyday: there no war crimes, its just tool to accuse others
[3:00:00] yourafghandaddy: No there are rules of war
[3:00:02] themeatshed: Playing a ranged top laner.
[3:00:05] ALLKAPS: POG 2 WINS LETS GET IT
[3:00:08] FaceIGN: true, its only warcrimes if you loose the war
[3:00:10] bsilver1215: i think war crimes are war-level crimes, like genocide and espionage.  not crimes done in war-time
[3:00:12] wallahiwallaha92: raping all women in a town is pretty worse than 2 gunmen shooting against each other
[3:00:31] ALLKAPS: wangs once you hit master are we going for grand master this season?

[3:00:56] yourafghandaddy: They do get broken you are right
[3:00:59] SRRW95: A big one is the use of bio/chemical warfare
[3:01:04] imtheyeti: Its not a war crime the first time
[3:01:07] sickmrjay: what are we talking about?
[3:01:15] cptsunnyday: its mean there no rules for winners
[3:01:17] yourafghandaddy: But there are sometimes repurcussions for it
[3:01:17] PlaginDL: there are “rules” for war, which no one could enforce because there is no “world military police”. Wars in Ukraine/Israel proved it
[3:01:41] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[3:01:55] FaceIGN: the rules are made by the winners and imposed on the loosers of the war
[3:01:56] yourafghandaddy: Invading also has rules
[3:02:11] PlaginDL: USSR did a lot of war crimes during WW2, no one got punished for it @wingsofdeath
[3:02:24] mechgutz: thats what im saying
[3:02:28] InhumaneJEKyLL: I think its more- the winners control the history
[3:02:36] InhumaneJEKyLL: and therefore the rules
[3:02:41] Crumpsi: teemo
[3:02:49] mechgutz: good luck making soilders follow those rules
[3:02:50] Maeg: bush and blair are some famous war criminals
[3:02:58] sickmrjay: if we are talking about ukraine than its very contradictory imo
[3:03:09] lolske: damn wings mixing it up today
[3:03:24] toshi_washi: the use of drones
[3:03:28] livealittlewhileucan: Popy was insane like 2018?
[3:03:40] SRRW95: I think people confusing rules for "established" truths
[3:04:20] Buster839: dragon mancer kass Pog
[3:04:21] PlaginDL: @wingsofdeath there are “rules” for war, which no one could enforce because there is no “world military police”. Wars in Ukraine/Israel proved it
[3:04:28] Junodude: guns ok. napalam bad
[3:04:29] mechgutz: during the napoleonic wars commanders had to legit hang soldiers to stop them from looting
[3:04:41] InhumaneJEKyLL: Yeah, but if Germany had won and used chemical warfare- they wouldnt have made rules against it
[3:04:44] xHei_57: lol, their quinn's name is BigDick in spanish
[3:04:53] sickmrjay: but who is actually gonna enforce it? everyone will condemn it but then again thats what un peace keepers are for
[3:04:55] feetofdeath: @PlaginDL then whats nato and the un?
[3:05:15] cptsunnyday: @PlaginDL which crimes? Like genocide Jews? Or mb nuke civil city?
[3:05:15] Warhog__: laws only matter for those not rich enough to afford paying fines LUL
[3:05:21] Itsumi: there's rules, for example frangible bullets are illegal thats why US military doesn't use hollow points
[3:05:23] yourafghandaddy: You are right
[3:05:33] PlaginDL: @feetofdeath so what UN and NATO did to russia for breaking rules?
[3:05:33] fluff_etc: you really expect more from twitch chat?
[3:05:37] the_pug_witcher: why are you even talking about this?
[3:05:38] FaceIGN: the punishment are way harder to enforce when talking about rules of war. since offent the loosers are dead or most of them are.
[3:05:39] ALLKAPS: wtf is that kass skin
[3:05:49] sickmrjay: depolyed with the 173rd abrne to the sand lot and i still have questions
[3:05:57] yourafghandaddy: Wings is right
[3:05:59] LordMcWilliams: You know that skit about the UN "Sanction me. Sanction me with your army! Oh, wait, you ain't got no army. That means you better shut the fuck up!".
[3:06:05] ALLKAPS: why does kass look like morde in that skin
[3:06:23] Metrobiggie: how strong is poppy rn
