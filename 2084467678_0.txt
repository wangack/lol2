[2:32:48] manyatwtv: @miguelqt well genetics can play a small part when it comes to the talent.
[2:32:56] manyatwtv: The rest is hard work and dedication
[2:33:10] svcnsi: Lol you really think genetics are only a physical thing?
[2:33:47] Shammerham: I think he's just saying they weren't born and instantly challenger they all had to put in the time to get there
[2:33:59] miguelqt: what type of genetics were there in this scenario?
[2:34:27] manyatwtv: @miguelqt its just unique talent for gaming buddy
[2:34:51] miguelqt: yeah no
[2:34:55] manyatwtv: But of course, thats just a small part, the key thing is dedication and hard work
[2:34:59] Sanecore: you're either good at games or you aren't
[2:35:16] svcnsi: Its obviously not just talent, but almost all professionals are talented combined with hard work dedication etc
[2:35:41] manyatwtv: I agree

[2:35:56] Sanecore: talent is the differentiator
[2:36:07] Zodiac_Walker: "Gaming" itself isn't a talent, u need to talk about it a more technical functional level like reaction speed, decision making etc.
[2:36:38] svcnsi: Of course, same can be said with top tier point guards in basketball, its not talent in a sport but the nuances that come w it
[2:36:38] Zodiac_Walker: I do def think if you have an older brother you look up to and diligently watching over a period of time in childhood is a huge contributer to wanting to imrpove
[2:36:48] miguelqt: yeah you can have genetics to be good looking, genetics to have big back n balls but genetics for being good at games, hell no. in my opinion
[2:37:11] Sanecore: explain why all of Korea is good at games then
[2:37:14] Sanecore: its genetic
[2:37:16] manyatwtv: Well its not only a physical thing
[2:37:16] svcnsi: genetics arent just physical, peoples iq are different not just from the choices they make in their life
[2:37:17] smokeleadeveryday: might be over
[2:37:34] svcnsi: no matter how hard kadeem works

[2:48:56] kylerarc: or make him choose between sustain and damage like if his w isnt consumed he can heal from it idk

[3:49:40] mark02: stormrazor essence reaver is the usual crit build
[3:50:20] Ayyyvi: too much atksp i think one and i think terminus prob needs to be paired with another on hit item
[3:50:49] Pallydin: they really need to fix the skill shot visual to hitbox visuals
[3:50:52] vrgambit: Didn't you hear your Rumble? He said its a mid gap
