[1:36:04] blyve: lichbane addict
[1:36:21] Zaxamaphone: all aboard the death train, choo choo
[1:36:58] Zaxamaphone: I don't think those two  things are mutually exclusive, but I have no idea if it got nerfed.
[1:37:10] undefined314: We always believe you. If you say it got nerfed, it probably got removed from the game or something.
[1:37:48] Zaxamaphone: If it is nerfed in your mind, that is all that matters.
[1:38:42] blyve: xdd
[1:38:44] kennychunggg: NOOOO
[1:38:52] kennychunggg: that is cursed

[1:39:52] Caster_1_1: "blind" :P
[1:40:02] katinent: o7
[1:40:03] undefined314: @kemppowerful Because of the similarity to standard Janet noises?

[1:44:37] lolgriffin: whattt a league stream?
[1:44:38] undefined314: A very artistic and distinctive kind of high-pitched gibberish
[1:44:41] lolgriffin: hi sally
[1:44:59] Zaxamaphone: weird, you deal with bears chasing you in league the same as in real life... "DOWN BEAR"
[1:45:01] Zaxamaphone: works every time

[1:46:32] Zaxamaphone: pork too distracting
[1:46:38] Caster_1_1: nothing worse than being excited for something you cook and it doesn't turn out as good as you want
[1:47:09] katinent: the noodles are the best part anyways LUL
[1:47:27] undefined314: Wait isn't the guy flaming you the same guy who was baiting with their champion selection
[1:47:34] Gunstar_Hero: was it the seasoning or the breading on the pork that wasnt good? or the sauce?

[1:51:27] katinent: pbe is poppin alecafRave
[1:51:30] stitchft: i got in like twice
[1:51:32] Zaxamaphone: you gotta show you deserve pbe access
[1:51:36] Gunstar_Hero: too many out of region people with pbe accounts, they shouldn't have
[1:51:40] JMSavior: if i'm on ofc i'm down
[1:51:48] Zaxamaphone: well you don't do whatever that was last game
[1:52:09] Gunstar_Hero: it's an NA server, lol
[1:52:16] Gunstar_Hero: they all have super high ping

[1:52:30] shamneo: cute flower top gellygelly. how are the games?
[1:52:33] katinent: is there mmr in pbe? triHmm
[1:52:35] dyeelytra: Pbe Is a global Server
[1:52:37] dirodian: u can play pbe from all over the world but the server is in NA
[1:52:41] Zaxamaphone: lmao, how do you think they would set that up? Where would they put the server so everyone's ping was okay?
[1:52:43] Gunstar_Hero: no it's one NA PBE server, and other people just access it
[1:52:47] Zaxamaphone: haha
[1:53:02] JMSavior: surely
[1:53:07] undefined314: An electron beam evaporator can deposit high-purity gold onto various substrates. To prepare the instrument for running, it requires flushing with argon gas and pumping down to vacuum repeatedly to remove contaminants. This can still be done faster than Sally warming up for League. tinakiBurn
[1:53:20] Gunstar_Hero: @dyeelytra it's not global, it's an NA server and people from other regions access it
