[0:35:02] archimedes_9: did you know ravens can imitate speech too
[0:35:08] loonaa: depends on the type of parrot, but some live up to 80
[0:35:16] ThomasTheTwink: there‚Äôs support item nerf on PBE apparently
[0:35:18] MissJenella: I love ravens they're so smart
[0:35:30] MissJenella: seraphine mid feels just the same tbh, but with painful early waveclear
[0:36:01] som963: Birdge
[0:36:05] archimedes_9: @MissJenella same corvids in general peepoWow
[0:36:15] BKhamzi: @MissJenella ALOO
[0:36:18] CrazeyeOuO: nooo, I used to pick Seraphine when my ADC's got picked or banned
[0:36:18] MissJenella: trying to cs with just autos with the passive nerfs and base ad nerf is soooo painful it hurts
[0:36:19] archimedes_9: imagine going into a forest and you hear a raven talking without knowing beforehand that birds can talk
[0:36:25] MissJenella: @BKhamzi hii :3
[0:36:31] MissJenella: @archimedes_9 yesss
[0:36:36] loonaa: the birds that mimic sounds of construction is so spooky
[0:36:41] RlyBadPlyer: I mean it's a nerf to non-snowball gold scaling enchanters
[0:36:48] som963: Time to buy doran and steal all the cs peepoHappy
[0:36:52] MissJenella: @CrazeyeOuO it's ok you can play swain hwei ziggs :') like I do

[0:37:40] CrazeyeOuO: @MissJenella I feel like I run it when I play Swain. :"D
[0:37:45] CrazeyeOuO: Could try Hwei tho
[0:37:49] RlyBadPlyer: @zabarud0 basically less gold overall
[0:37:52] vogue_hommes: in pbe the support quest only gives 800g
[0:38:09] voidmoons: the best vayne skin
[0:38:10] MissJenella: @CrazeyeOuO yea hwei feels a lot better to play apc than mid too :3 just like sera
[0:38:12] voidmoons: ptw
[0:38:16] vogue_hommes: no the stacks give less gold too
[0:38:19] chee_bii: lulu feels so strong
[0:38:27] ThomasTheTwink: they nerfed the gold from stacks too
[0:38:51] som963: !rank
[0:38:52] LoLRankBot: 5tunt  is Grandmaster  519 LP
[0:39:05] CrazeyeOuO: @MissJenella haven't played a lot of Hwei, it'll be a bit before I play him properly. XD
[0:39:08] ZABARUD0: less agency i guess but like you said its an equal nerf to red and blue side
[0:39:22] ThomasTheTwink: pfft
[0:39:28] ZABARUD0: would make the role less impactful tho no?
[0:39:28] MissJenella: @CrazeyeOuO oh yeaaa it's definitely a bit of a learning curve, you absolutely cannot button mash LOL
[0:39:42] RlyBadPlyer: ok but can they nerf roaming zzz

[1:00:11] zat798: Stunt can't keep getting away with these
[1:00:17] shinyclodsire: lol
[1:00:19] liljrSanchez: @RlyBadPlyer it's just a variation of tank zilean. you stay alive and are able to use your utility slow and Q stuns, ult your teammates instead of yourself. Also warmogs spike is good because you get the passive after 1st itme
[1:00:20] RlyBadPlyer: it's a supression so you can't Mikael's
[1:00:30] MissJenella: stuntShh

[1:01:58] liljrSanchez: @RlyBadPlyer you can, it's just nice that you can have a bad trade and be low HP and warmog passive heals you up all the way
[1:02:01] vrgambit: Wow you won even though your adc locked in zeri
[1:02:04] magicalpen: warmogs zilean holy

[1:07:04] vrgambit: Nanners was doing it yesterday
[1:07:10] RlyBadPlyer: that was intended actually
[1:07:10] mark02: oh gross
[1:07:29] psychocwilly: double support Bedge
[1:07:34] RlyBadPlyer: Like, the relic stacks not counting for double support(?)
[1:07:43] borellyy: alr im down then for double sup i have ads rn so i cant see but i trust
[1:07:45] vrgambit: Yep and next patch support item is finally getting nuked
[1:07:50] vrgambit: As it should
[1:08:00] RiftJockel: @vrgambit how?
[1:08:01] psychocwilly: can you run gamba stunt so we can entertain ourselves
[1:08:02] ijustkiddingg: yay you came back online!
[1:08:20] vrgambit: They're lowering the gold fountain to 800 and making the rate 30% slower
[1:08:27] RoyalNefario: vips should be able to poll nodd
[1:08:31] vrgambit: So tldr 200 less free gold and 10% longer
[1:08:33] MissJenella: LMFAO
[1:08:38] PortugueseCook: Do you pay your mods?
[1:08:44] RiftJockel: thats mean
[1:08:47] psychocwilly: the slash mod command shows lots of mods
[1:08:48] RiftJockel: buff supp poggers
[1:08:49] mark02: If Riot don't want double support items they should just make it so if more than one person has it in a 3k radius both are disabled
[1:08:57] Cybychen: A friend of mine wanted to make me mod in his stream and I was just like DONT YOU DARE xD
[1:09:02] PortugueseCook: stuntSad
[1:09:07] kurumulol: Pay your viewers instead of your mods :3
[1:09:13] BaneBladeV: internet better? peepoCute
[1:09:24] wilfrLd: dreaemROFLMAO Don't expose me like that
[1:09:27] vrgambit: Do you have any early opinions on the support item nerfs that hit pbe
[1:09:37] Pyraelon: Best Sona skin Twitch chat?
[1:09:39] Voodoo_Kween: tft set 11 on the PBE is so fun tbh
[1:09:51] vegandiamond: i like guqin sona
[1:09:55] RlyBadPlyer: you want to ignore casters btw if it's not as lenient
[1:09:58] kurumulol: i like SG Sona
[1:10:11] h0lee: i like PsyOps
[1:10:36] Voodoo_Kween: psyops, SG, and the base immortal journey are her best particle effects
[1:10:59] clara_tc: i like immortal journey too
[1:11:08] dyleni: I like sg, my favorite was dj but after they changed the particles it fell from 1st place
[1:11:12] BaneBladeV: classic support abuse
[1:11:18] RlyBadPlyer: Basically the idea is that casters have less gold /cs compared to melees/cannons
[1:11:39] Voodoo_Kween: IJ sona has the wings on her instrument when power chord is ready, but the prestige doesnt
[1:11:53] dyleni: My streak reset waaa
[1:12:12] BaneBladeV: @Voodoo_Kween wings would have fit the prestige better ;-;
[1:12:20] h0lee: @Voodoo_Kween I like her hair in the normal IJ skin better too :(
[1:12:23] MissJenella: I like pentakill 3 the best
[1:12:25] RlyBadPlyer: @voodoo_kween I like the spinny swords more tbh
[1:12:49] Voodoo_Kween: yeah her hair and the wings make me like it more than the prestige
[1:13:19] Voodoo_Kween: @RlyBadPlyer i fell in love with the wings idea when SG came out, so i may be biased idk
[1:13:27] RlyBadPlyer: also I think the relic interaction with cannons is fucking stupid
[1:13:32] BaneBladeV: wings are peepoCute
[1:13:36] RlyBadPlyer: Senna gets both g9ld and the soul like wtf
[1:13:49] vrgambit: I played with this janna and talked to her earlier, nice person
[1:13:58] h0lee: I wonder if theyll be playing double supp in LCS this weekend
[1:14:05] BaneBladeV: @Voodoo_Kween dawnbringer soraka, stuff like that :3
[1:14:23] MissJenella: LOL
[1:14:46] Pyraelon: Jannas are always trynna be hyper aggressive for some reason. Deserved lol
[1:14:47] Voodoo_Kween: @BaneBladeV DB soraka is better than immortal journey soraka. anyone who disagrees can argue with their mother
[1:15:08] borellyy: i feel like since we've played 4 games togther in the past 3d its a sign i get added 2 the mighty friendslist
[1:15:15] RlyBadPlyer: @voodoo_kween I like the effects on Dawnbringer but I like IJ's robes tbh
[1:15:41] BaneBladeV: Voodoo_Kween GIGACHAD
[1:16:06] Voodoo_Kween: IJ has nothing on DB's hair
[1:16:22] RlyBadPlyer: What if support items could only have 3 wards on the map
[1:16:23] h0lee: VIewerlow LMAO
[1:16:32] BaneBladeV: farming this janna lmao
[1:16:37] RlyBadPlyer: like all the support items collectively just have a maximum of 3
[1:16:38] chee_bii: how do you not get the support gold nerf
[1:16:45] vrgambit: Is that even bad, you have a lot of gm supports that watch you
[1:16:51] Voodoo_Kween: all those years and DB soraka still has the best hair
[1:16:51] vrgambit: Its still top 1k
[1:16:59] RlyBadPlyer: @chee_bii relic stacks don't count towards the debuff
[1:17:09] MissJenella: LOL
[1:17:14] MissJenella: stuntShh
[1:17:16] ThomasTheTwink: real
[1:17:19] chee_bii: @RlyBadPlyer so just let the minions die most of the time?
[1:17:34] h0lee: Aphelios?
[1:17:38] h0lee: hes pretty shit rn
[1:17:45] one2tagg: kaisa players got the most insane movement in the world
[1:17:48] RlyBadPlyer: @chee_bii not sure about other bugs atm
[1:18:07] Voodoo_Kween: kaisa is also absurdly strong still
[1:18:22] Voodoo_Kween: goes eclipse into full AP and wins any fight at any range
[1:18:23] BaneBladeV: you're also getting a lot of janna stacks
[1:18:27] multiples: double support item is back???
[1:18:46] BaneBladeV: with her not knowing what chord ignite does classic

[1:20:40] RlyBadPlyer: I still don't like dreammaker tbh
[1:20:41] xTeeko: where do you check stats?

[1:21:09] RiftJockel: still
[1:21:24] Sarynse: Will the support item nerfs kill of things like camille supp that needs pricy bruiser items? I'm a bad player so not sure
[1:21:30] h0lee: Yeah its still there but im not sure if the debuff shows
