[1:24:53] Neuro_Alpha: that song is so awkward .. something just wrong about it
[1:25:07] kvothelir: Do you like noname?
[1:25:19] chartablat5: @Neuro_Alpha they are playing it in the wrong key.
[1:25:22] metalwrath22222: this song reminds us about our previous lives and also how we made decisions before we born
[1:25:43] kvothelir: !darius
[1:25:43] Nightbot: just outscale (you win lvl 1 and 6)
[1:26:07] kvothelir: !gnar

[1:26:12] Nightbot: stalemate just scale dont fight
[1:26:25] kvothelir: !nasus
[1:26:25] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists

[1:27:57] suyashmedhavi: !olaf fair champ lol
[1:27:57] Nightbot: run from his axe and ult.
[1:28:03] kvothelir: !malphite
[1:28:03] Nightbot: in teamfights ult his shield he will have low armor cause of the interaction. Dont trade with him in lane just hit the minions
[1:28:04] Neuro_Alpha: @chartablat5 maybe a copy .. idk but it feels wrong
[1:28:13] Nemox666: that's why i like Olaf. be a mighty mean Viking running at your enemys swinging axes!
