[2:34:52] crucial1711: i'm not good at this game so i dont know but i feel like akali into yasuo is not a great matchup
[2:35:12] QtDivinity: @crucial1711 it's a skill matchup ftmp
[2:35:37] crucial1711: @QtDivinity i figured yasuo would just have enough sustain to just tank akali's kit and then chase her down
[2:35:45] PsycheKit: akali has the range advantage but yasuo wins extended trades, its very skill based
[2:36:21] QtDivinity: @crucial1711 ya that's why you cant play at his turret lmao
[2:36:48] QtDivinity: just because he wins sustained 1v1s atm doesnt make it a yas favored matchup both have ways to win
[2:36:50] crucial1711: I guess at the end of the day you're doing your job as long as you manage wave and get good roams
[2:37:47] crucial1711: ngl, i didn't realize this was that kind of lobby, bro was banking his level up with his tornado lol
[2:38:03] PsycheKit: is this a freeze
[2:38:13] QtDivinity: we're listening to jesus music LMAO
[2:38:25] strawberry_nerd: -1 wave EZ
[2:38:46] strawberry_nerd: 3/4 ranged or something
[2:39:00] JainaUK: guess you trim a few casters but precise wave manip is too big brain for me
[2:39:26] QtDivinity: are you talking about for freeze?
[2:39:34] Lastmike: classic
[2:39:56] crucial1711: i think its 2 extra casters except on cannon waves its all casters
[2:40:04] QtDivinity: 3 full health casters perma freezes in mid assuming the next wave doesnt get shot by turret

[2:42:01] EnmityFervor: Exhaust LUL
[2:42:28] crucial1711: are you excited for PoE 2? or is it too much of a departure from the first game for you
[2:42:46] dummydanlol: darkee draven KEKWait
[2:42:48] dummydanlol: monkaW
[2:43:35] JainaUK: more meaningful combat + poe depth of build and endgame is a big LOGIN
[2:43:58] crucial1711: they definitely slowed it down quite a bit, i think thats why they decided not to merge the games and keep that URF feeling of endgame builds for PoE 1
[2:44:41] JainaUK: i don't think it'll be that slow, like 75% of a regular endgame zoom, just not hyperspeed
[2:45:03] JainaUK: the demos they've shown so far are def way slower than it will actually be
[2:45:10] crucial1711: @JainaUK i don't see how so many of the combo skills they showcased could possibly be done in that turbo speed we see in poe1
[2:45:29] crucial1711: there would be tons of animation cancelling might look janky
[2:45:39] Wagiie: a nice champ
[2:45:52] OxiBleach: @imexile I know it depends until week before, but any new PoE builds you eyeing or you thinking DD again?
[2:45:53] EnmityFervor: imagine if yasuo used R there

[3:04:13] JainaUK: ofc not but it's so funny
[3:04:21] JainaUK: people losing their mind over it
[3:04:47] PPPingu: its been 2 months of him playing it. Cant really remember a champ being 54% wr with high pickrate for 2 months
[3:04:51] enemyoftrust: phreak is too busy playing poe
[3:05:12] JainaUK: he just abuses whatever is strong
[3:05:33] RagDan: wtf
[3:05:35] JainaUK: bro left the church of adc and started spamming janna and maokai, and he climbs, not a surprise
[3:05:36] RagDan: ignite nasus
[3:05:42] RagDan: that guy is about to feed or carry
[3:05:51] Shinigami2069: probably so people dont shit on him on reddit that he is too noob to balance (they still do)
[3:05:55] NoOneBalancing: starting as a OTP is easiest way to learn and climb for sure
[3:06:10] Yatoguy: He's got the Platinum Challenge thingy
[3:06:26] surii3: its nice to have 1 champ for each niche in a role

[3:07:33] Icedragn: yeah definitely a 1 trick champ
[3:07:53] Wagiie: KEKW
[3:07:54] enemyoftrust: why league is so "maining" focused
[3:07:54] Nightbot: because its the best
[3:08:04] Wagiie: no
[3:08:05] JainaUK: because it's the easiest way to climb
[3:08:28] JainaUK: if you're comfortable with a champ or a small amount, you can focus less on piloting the champ and more on the actual gamestate
[3:08:34] PPPingu: @enemyoftrust matchups and knowing ur damage is important and learning that on 5 champs is harder than 1
[3:08:36] NoOneBalancing: @enemyoftrust cause most ppl cant even learn one role Kappa
[3:08:44] Wagiie: YEP
[3:08:47] Icedragn: yeah really lets you focus on macro
[3:08:49] enemyoftrust: isnt it beneficial to counter pick and pick for team comp tho?
[3:09:03] JainaUK: counterpicks dont matter if you're bad at the champ and the other person is good at theirs
[3:09:09] cluckinbellz: she has like 650, its insane, same as cait
[3:09:09] JainaUK: in most cases, some shit is unplayable
[3:09:16] PPPingu: @enemyoftrust thats why u should play 2-3 champs not exclusively 1
[3:09:37] cluckinbellz: nvm i lied she has 625, cait has 650
[3:09:47] enemyoftrust: the idea of playing 1 hero is boring to me
[3:10:08] enemyoftrust: but thats just me
[3:10:12] JainaUK: having a pool of like 3-5 is best, one tricking is just popular
[3:10:43] surii3: irelking is so fun to watch too

[4:36:12] Icedragn: @zauxik yeah that's fair as well
[4:37:29] Icedragn: if you get early grubs and can force plates it's super nice, I think in games where it's going your way you can force your lead p hard w grubs + herald
