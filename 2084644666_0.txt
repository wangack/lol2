[0:24:41] RelentlessLoL7: @Jackspektra yo jack how do you decide on how many points of W you will skill as Smolder?
[0:24:45] alejandrorls: But a good adc has to be insta hotfixed
[0:25:02] solstario: its rounded down I think
[0:25:02] shaavola: Maokai only got slap on the wrist again
[0:25:09] Inerence: mao nerfs after phreak hits chal
[0:25:16] alejandrorls: @shaavola they waited 3 patches

[0:26:08] solstario: @alejandrorls he was the highest wr highest ban highest pick
[0:26:11] shaavola: Absolutely nothing
[0:26:16] PPPingu: Smolder was legit broken, it's not the same as a 51% wr fiora with low pickrate

[0:26:57] kompyyyy: @zGShinji i stand corrected
[0:26:59] solstario: @alejandrorls that's because phreak is going to switch to janna after mao nerfs

[0:33:14] alejandrorls: But how do you all now they are buffing crit?
[0:33:16] IMW_Lecro: remember when IE had 80 AD, doubled crit chance and had 15% true dmg
[0:33:16] zGShinji: question, do pro players drink much? I assume not but would be curious to know if like Emenes is outlier
[0:33:30] ToneDoLOL: xdd

[0:34:42] shaavola: Yay 2 extra shots on e

[0:40:20] Aura_Jakkaru: I think e change was tiny bit overdone, should have been like 1 per 100 stacks or 80 not from 1 per 50 to 1 per 150
[0:40:24] grumpyy05: XDD
[0:40:27] ToneDoLOL: personally i think jack is brasilian
[0:40:29] 360DropKickblind: kjøøør da
[0:40:29] Aura_Jakkaru: It'll never be relevant spell again smile
[0:40:32] StrangeDream2633: hi
[0:40:32] Zifi1: breaks the connection no longer having a keyboard o7
[0:40:32] FeomatarSG: create a new donate goal: New keyboard
[0:40:42] EtherNavas: its zeri in a good spot?
[0:40:43] squidbub: what did the hotfix do
[0:40:43] Sintemon: what did they hotfix
[0:40:44] iamfoivos: !goals
[0:40:44] Nightbot: My SoloQ goals for 2024 are, Rank 1, 75% winrate top 10, 3 Accounts Challenger.
[0:40:59] shaavola: Phroxzon had it retweeted
[0:41:00] zGShinji: doable goals yep
[0:41:01] rases00: yeah lol dev on twitter
[0:41:03] Aura_Jakkaru: E bolts: 5 (+1 per 50 stacks) >>> 5 (+1 per 150 stacks)  -Fixed a bug that caused Smolder's stacks to round up when calculating number of E bolts  -R Cooldown: 120/110/100 >>> 140/130/120 seconds
[0:41:18] Aura_Jakkaru: Yeah per 150 makes the spell shit again
[0:41:18] grumpyy05: what was wrong with 50... :/ LUL
[0:41:24] 1lmann2: e also was super broken
[0:41:26] yeandhi: yeah they take way too long to tell you abt hotfixes in client
[0:41:34] Aura_Jakkaru: @grumpyy05 getting 5 shots at 200 stacks was insane damage
[0:41:37] 1lmann2: i think 75 would be fair
[0:41:50] grumpyy05: @Aura_Jakkaru for me the champ feels shit LUL
[0:41:55] 1lmann2: true
[0:42:00] Sintemon: yea
[0:42:00] 1lmann2: very easy also
[0:42:01] Aura_Jakkaru: Well hes still the most broken adc rn
[0:42:18] yeandhi: briar and naafiri r pretty brainded too
[0:42:40] karakaya: its so good for metal to play smolder
[0:42:41] CagIsTaken: he was made to be easy
[0:42:45] shiwamamo: this is riots solution to overbuffing supports OMEGALUL
[0:42:50] karakaya: mantal
[0:42:54] karakaya: ^mental
[0:43:01] rases00: Riot should let you lose some stacks on death.
[0:43:28] PPPingu: Riot should let you cash in on your stacks on kill
[0:43:37] yeandhi: well kayle is kinda unskilled post 16 too no? if you know how to kite
[0:43:43] squidbub: you should lose 75% of your stacks on death
[0:43:46] zGShinji: what if the burn was moved to the E, activating at 225 stacks
[0:43:56] Aura_Jakkaru: @rases00 thatd be a shit change vs just raising the threshold
[0:43:59] 1lmann2: @squidbub HAHHAHA
[0:44:04] DonnTeoo: Q - spit fire W - spit fire in a straight line E - fly and spit fire R - call mom to spit fire
[0:44:10] Aura_Jakkaru: Then its just play the entire game trying to kill or protect smolder and jts shit
[0:44:11] Rias_Gremory: Riot has just messed up how the recently added infinitely scaling champs work. You can't really stop or reduce their stacking unless you don't interact with them
[0:44:17] Sintemon: kayle also cant go over walls
[0:44:19] Sintemon: lol
[0:44:27] xaviertearslol: yea but u need to get to 16
[0:44:28] Mir3L_EUNE: What buffs crit adc get?
[0:44:39] PPPingu: Smolder is way better than kayle early and spikes before her
[0:44:51] BTronZ: smolder mid incoming?
[0:44:51] shiwamamo: must be agurin again
[0:44:52] zGShinji: smolder lane phase also not that bad, esp compared to kayle
[0:44:52] Mir3L_EUNE: I hope they do 25%crit per item and 5 more ad per item
[0:44:54] shiwamamo: who else plays j4
[0:45:00] yeandhi: @PPPingu ok thats true
[0:45:05] FeomatarSG: I like idea of losing stacks, maybe not % but to thresholds on q. And lower dmg numbers
[0:45:13] Zifi1: hwei mid angle
[0:45:15] Zifi1: PauseChamp
[0:45:15] rases00: smolder mid?
[0:45:16] AdmiralEdgarGorgon: more big kog gameplay today? the most skilled adc around
[0:45:17] DonnTeoo: Perhaps change the AP+AD scaling on the spell and add AD scaling to the W, for example if Q is 80% AD and 20% AP, make it 60% AD and 40% AP, and add some AD scaling to the W
[0:45:19] EveryoneCallsmeTim: smolder mid time?
[0:45:42] Silen3e: might be agurin
[0:45:43] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[0:45:49] Sintemon: less dmg on q, more dmg on ult to champions for smolder maybe as well?
[0:45:52] filterkaapi: Doesnt matter no? you will do true damage anyway xdd
[0:45:52] shaavola: Voidwalking time
[0:45:56] squidbub: draven mid
[0:45:57] JekeDano: DRAVON MID
[0:45:59] AdmiralEdgarGorgon: kogmaw mid
[0:46:00] yeandhi: meh losing stacks wouldn't be fair bcs some games as adc u can't prevent deaths
[0:46:00] Sintemon: ult feels so whatever, just waveclear spell

[1:03:54] ADL1337: shen got it

[1:28:43] xxhide1: https://twitter.com/Spideraxe30

[1:29:24] ADCPurple: 11 feathers hit 2 rip
[1:29:25] ashuyoxoxo: or that u had 40% crit with ie 2nd and then u see 2 item lethality esnna who has no luck and is sooner online cause lethality items are cheap af

[1:39:41] Armada17: have you tried kogmaw
[1:40:00] ADCPurple: kog is still not great

[1:40:49] ADCPurple: depends on team comp but lulu mostly
[1:41:26] Armada17: fair enough
[1:42:01] yeandhi: lulu is superior in every aspect unless u REAllllly need extra range from milio
[1:42:33] ADCPurple: @yeandhi i mean if they have amumu or something like that then milio R is huge
[1:42:43] ADCPurple: like milio is x10 better than lulu into rakan
[1:42:44] rework3097: milio is good in specific situations where his ult is rly 1v9

[1:49:59] ADCPurple: @jokers_me cheap, easier farm and amazing stats
[1:50:12] gammarayblue: statikk is the best noonquiver item cause it's dirt cheap
[1:50:30] ADCPurple: @gammarayblue its def not the best, its really the worst but its so cheap
[1:50:34] Dwippah: what makes it better than pd rush then? just the farm?
[1:50:46] ADCPurple: @Dwippah noon quiver item op
[1:50:54] Trickymarksman: lol arent the crit changes not exactly the changes you suggested some days ago? @Jackspektra  :D
[1:51:03] Trickymarksman: like buffing IE and navori
[1:51:19] gammarayblue: @ADCPurple I mean they even build it on Aphelios and Cait now so like-
[1:51:21] ADCPurple: @Trickymarksman na ie has same ad and jack wanted +10 ad on ie not rit chance
[1:51:34] Dwippah: @ADCPurple what about noonquiver into pd then? I kinda hate the thought of wasting a slot on statikk ngl
[1:52:09] gammarayblue: @Dwippah you sound like you don't play adc ngl
[1:52:14] ADCPurple: i mean if its working for you PD IE doesnt sound giga dog shit but it feels like it lacks dmg

[1:52:54] ADCPurple: @gammarayblue me?
[1:53:17] ADCPurple: you get +30 ad from statikk so idk
[1:53:18] gammarayblue: nah @Dwippah suggesting to skip the quiver item
[1:53:27] Kintion: Mr jack, will you make a tier list for 14.5?  @Jackspektra
[1:54:05] ADCPurple: I think you almost have to go noon quiver on a crit marksmen

[1:55:24] letherphantam: that has to be baus
[1:56:03] Dwippah: yeah Im just wondering why in the past we had BF + PD for AS and AD and not do the same with noonquiver since PD gives crazy stats as well

[1:59:07] petersen_lol: did you see rekkles janna in T1A?
[1:59:41] 365Doors: green blue does more damage and the one "weak" part of this variation (red purple) is something you stay on for a few autos only
[2:00:15] big_yapper: but to end up on that rotation you have one rota of purple/white right
[2:00:17] townofbird: i do love green blue

[2:02:01] PHMandV: @lolsergee true
[2:02:01] 365Doors: @big_yapper if you use blue first at the beginning, yes. but if you use your purple enough before getting rid of blue, you'll have white purple for such a short time that it doesnt matter much. you'll get red white super soon
[2:02:16] Aniverr: why statikk?

[2:25:44] hecarimmilk: @Sorvicer lol though u trolling but actually tomorow KEKW

[2:28:39] i_am_ivern: @ijustbod ty :]
[2:28:48] kuubinn: Hi sir Jack. How the best ADC in the room doing today?
[2:29:25] RukiHyena: @i_am_ivern what hotfix? i didnt hear of a hotfix?
[2:29:46] tfisz98: nerf on Smolder E and R cd
[2:29:54] wacharucas7: Did u see JDG greetings to MDK
[2:30:04] tfisz98: E number of shots, R cd*
[2:30:25] HERME__: yeah now you need like 350 stacks to hit with E 7 times
[2:30:32] RukiHyena: its not in the patch notes, were do i see these changes?
[2:30:33] VoteKickEdo: game looks won
[2:31:03] VoteKickEdo: not anymore kek
[2:31:09] freezhyy_: u had to speak heeheh
[2:31:11] Iukas48: you cursed it VoteKickEdo
[2:31:12] yeandhi: fastest jinx in the west
[2:31:15] VoteKickEdo: xD
[2:31:20] potentsapprentice: Do we know why galeforce was removed
[2:31:29] kilzgaard: cuz it was shit
[2:31:37] HERME__: to make crit adc shit
[2:31:46] Faramir1993: the sad part is u dont have such item as MAW vs ad asassins (
[2:32:13] Chipez: God forbid Adc have good items
[2:32:14] Iukas48: having an extra dash is either super op or completly useless NODDERS
[2:32:16] Stealthling_: how is adc nasus going
[2:32:23] jidfhcdihfh2: "too hard for them to balance" but mages get to keep zhonya
[2:32:26] tfisz98: you used to have bt, but now it's kinda bad @Faramir1993
[2:33:03] potentsapprentice: I was forced to abandon Aphelios cause of galeforce removal, im a siting duck now without it
[2:33:11] Faramir1993: @tfisz98 ye bt was good now it`s good to but not helping u to be alive)
[2:33:11] iKeyss: do we think sivir is playable after her buffs?
[2:33:39] Faramir1993: so sad RIOT cant understand that u cant do dmg if u cant stay alive)
[2:33:52] HERME__: if forg1ven or rekkles still played pro on adc they would pick up Sivir imo as a pocket pick ofc
[2:34:06] Chipez: HUH
[2:34:08] Stealthling_: HUH
[2:34:12] HERME__: HUH
[2:34:15] squidbub: how’s zeri into smolder?

[2:35:24] Stealthling_: @squidbub It was played in lpl today, you could maybe look there
[2:35:45] HERME__: I played with this one very good soraka recently, she'd make sure pyke can never cast q on me or engage on me, lane felt so damn free to play like literally impossible to lose. Support matters sooo much on bot lane it's not adc gap, it's support gap srsly
[2:36:17] acee_______: @HERME__ everyone knows this
[2:36:22] acee_______: that  has 10 iq above
[2:36:27] wacharucas7: So Smolder is the Kai sa, you can build whatever and it works?
[2:36:28] Stealthling_: @acee_______ always has been ye
[2:36:31] acee_______: everyone else just yappin
[2:36:33] squidbub: @stealthling_ what teams?

[2:36:44] HAZZALOL__: and its ace
[2:36:44] Iukas48: nah if you had 225
[2:36:45] HAZZALOL__: legit
[2:36:46] Iukas48: you ace
[2:36:46] HAZZALOL__: :0
[2:36:50] megau7: 2 charges only
[2:36:52] Faramir1993: outplayed LUL
[2:36:59] scriptkiddieno11: what is the buff to crit adc? @Jackspektra
[2:37:03] ijustbod: ZERIING ZERIING ZERIING
[2:37:16] potentsapprentice: Why not navori along with shojin?
[2:37:34] RukiHyena: feelsbad when a fight is determined by 2 stacks
[2:37:53] JJ_Gamer12: Is the Hotfix nerf for Smolder live already?

[2:41:20] RukiHyena: how does new scaling Q burn feel?
[2:41:29] HAZZALOL__: @damian_657 ye wonder why they buffed it
[2:41:33] banewastaken: Rengars gotta be tilted after that double zhonya
[2:41:40] kriscraazy: what si the name of this song?
[2:41:44] HERME__: is it worth it to buy zhonyia on every adc against heavy ad assassins team comp? like at least 2 ad assassins enemy team?
[2:41:52] Chipez: Burn nerf is big no
[2:41:57] sh0rtmaker: @HERME__ no
[2:42:06] futuref21: @Jackspektra sup jack , did u see the IE buffs ?

[2:43:03] potentsapprentice: 10 years will pass, Aphelios will never see the light again without galeforce
[2:43:06] damian_657: no navori?
[2:43:17] LoL_habby: @futuref21 have you seen the title?
[2:43:20] HERME__: @Chipez so 2 assassins my team comp + support ashe, then it's a YES right?
[2:43:50] Chipez: @HERME__ yes sure but not early. 3-4th item.
[2:43:53] kilzgaard: song name?
[2:44:00] HERME__: @Chipez yeah like last item or 5th
[2:44:05] Chipez: Yep
[2:44:05] RukiHyena: !song
[2:44:35] Chipez: @HERME__ but very situational. Dont make it a habit.
[2:45:11] theblasphemer666: how useless is your team
[2:45:46] RukiHyena: what's the burn at?
[2:46:42] Zifi1: PagBounce
[2:46:43] Chipez: team is rly rly bad
[2:46:50] Mercypl0x: no rfc?
[2:47:13] Chipez: rfc is bad in extended fights
[2:47:33] Chipez: i tink
[2:47:44] scriptkiddieno11: brain damage now ?
[2:47:45] RukiHyena: BT seems like a really strong smolder item with the new scaling
[2:47:50] scriptkiddieno11: burn damage no w?
[2:47:54] HERME__: how come every game there's at least 1 player in team that is hard inting bringing little to no value to the team. And the once he stops inting for 1 minute you win a fight or even the entire game lol
[2:48:18] Chipez: gg

[2:48:57] thebuzzzkilla: Did you like atkspeed shard?
[2:49:03] thebuzzzkilla: For lane
[2:49:03] VoteKickEdo: would you recommend smolder for a midlaner @Jackspektra
[2:49:11] damian_657: @rukihyena stronger late game
[2:49:18] scriptkiddieno11: why the hotfix does not show in the patch ?
[2:49:18] potentsapprentice: Inflation rate on supports was already high, with the shittonn of items they got it will only go higher
[2:49:23] HERME__: @Jackspektra is manamune kaisa meta right now? I've played against her yesterday and she was fed af but really useless regardless
[2:49:25] wacharucas7: Hey Jack, do you think IE buffs are huge or meh?
[2:50:04] HERME__: pre hotfix you kill him fr

[3:19:28] SingularFish: Base Stats Base Movement Speed: 335 ⇒ 330 Q - Bramble Smash Bonus Damage to Monsters: 80/100/120/140/160 ⇒ 120/130/140/150/160 W - Twisted Advance Cooldown: 13/12/11/10/9 ⇒ 14/13/12/11/10 seconds
[3:19:48] vvalentin15: @SingularFish huge nerf bro
[3:19:57] nunzytv: he can still just point and click root and knockup/slow
[3:19:59] xxhide1: typical league of legends game when there is always a 0/10 in your team
[3:20:03] nunzytv: and has a massive AOE root
[3:20:04] SingularFish: Mao will end up with 30% wr after this
[3:20:29] wacharucas7: @nunzytv u know if the build is the same?
[3:20:38] SingularFish: Nothing has changed
[3:20:46] SingularFish: Other than maybe new suppo item upgrade
[3:20:50] a122sdf: isn't potent supposed to be a fiora otp?
[3:20:52] nunzytv: @wacharucas7 yes, you still want ms to be able to be in range of W
[3:20:58] medluxi: is ie better than navori on zeri?
[3:21:08] bamzorlul: otp = win lane every time? LULE
[3:21:27] wacharucas7: @nunzytv thx, what spport item is the best?
[3:21:45] dream_lol1: crazy pressure from fiora
[3:21:46] wacharucas7: Even the frozen hearth nerfs werent that big, ¿No?
[3:22:09] nunzytv: @wacharucas7 sleigh or celestial are both fine, i prefer sleigh
[3:22:47] tfisz98: right now Fiora actually absorbed pressure
[3:23:18] lol_aleo: the classic renekton flash w
[3:23:25] a122sdf: 4 lvls ahead

[3:25:03] superlov3: why build so much as on Zeri if she's capped? @Jackspektra
[3:25:43] hededal360: Zeri's clear looks so satisfying
[3:25:54] kun1231231: excess gives something i assume
[3:25:58] sharpstud: is ldr just not worth buying atm?
[3:25:59] bamzorlul: forsen
[3:26:58] vvalentin15: why does fiora try to fight rene tho
[3:27:02] zapsniff: rookie mistake lol

[3:55:21] leaf071: and quickblades ad buff
[3:56:11] AdmiralEdgarGorgon: Jack what type of ADC do you feel like is missing from the game? I would love someone who just did one constant beam that locked on. Or a sentry turret champ
[3:56:20] Aura_Jakkaru: @jackspektra smolder feels least satisfying "dmging" ability in game now no?
[3:56:26] Aura_Jakkaru: Smolder e*
[3:56:41] CompassionateComrade: yuumi style adc
[3:56:45] Sangy55: rly good pyke q
[3:57:00] Saderako: turret that attaches to allies
[3:57:03] gin_41: magic auto attacker bot maybe??
[3:57:11] Ambitie: How about an ADC with counterstrike? Would be fun right?
[3:57:14] nunzytv: yuumi is 49% wr rn in Emerald+ which is not a great sign
[3:57:20] JamesVVayne: I miss trinity zeri
[3:57:21] JamesVVayne: (
[3:57:25] Camille_step_on_me: We need K'Sante ADC getting Tanky from DMG items Kappa
[3:57:42] darthbid: so akshan?
[3:57:44] Sangy55: like yone u mean?
[3:57:49] RukiHyena: aphilios?
[3:57:49] Camille_step_on_me: like Jinx but not on ability?
[3:57:50] biki02: akshan?
[3:57:57] vuntras: Like aphelios?
[3:57:58] Dragdar: Are you an APM junkie
[3:58:06] nunzytv: Lucian could have been like that
[3:58:11] Dragdar: I want some shit with high execution but high reward
[3:58:15] Dragdar: Samira was supposed to be that
[3:58:33] RukiHyena: you got enough food for chat?
[3:58:39] palexhs: nilah can aswell but not samira LUL
[3:58:45] tankytrash: @Dragdar idk why that champ had to be a reset champ
[3:58:53] gin_41: i wanted dmc in league instead we got that
[3:58:59] biki02: can they also fix how nilah e q works, it feels so clunky and the dmg literally doesnty hit if they walk out at max range
[3:59:03] Camille_step_on_me: I feel like an ADC where you actually choose upgrade kinda like Kha'Zix so it plays different depending on the game
[3:59:13] HAZZALOL__: @biki02 they fixed it already
[3:59:22] Samooooth: Zeri was supposed t obe a succes but they changer her so much
[3:59:24] Ambitie: Jhin?
[3:59:27] Dragdar: Kai'Sa is just so good man
[3:59:33] JamesVVayne: Zeri with Sheen proc on Q and Shields was a good
[3:59:33] biki02: @HAZZALOL__ oh shit when? this patch?
[3:59:38] Dragdar: You can't not enjoy that champ
[3:59:40] RukiHyena: new assasin adc like twitch?
[3:59:40] HAZZALOL__: @biki02 2/3 ago
[3:59:41] biki02: lucian needs his q range back
[3:59:51] freezhyy_: Kai´sa is probably one of the best last releases
[3:59:56] palexhs: lucian at launch was so fun
[4:00:02] Sangy55: like the first time shojin was added to the game
[4:00:13] biki02: trinity + youmus lucian was my fav
[4:00:14] biki02: in s5
[4:00:18] biki02: or 4 dk
[4:00:24] Zedifed: Hey chat, where can i find the crit buffs?
[4:00:47] Sintemon: then solo lane might be op again
[4:00:49] Sintemon: on lucian
[4:00:50] Dragdar: Lower upfront damage and reward spell cycling maybe
[4:00:50] shedo_47: it was so random when they introduced it no?
[4:01:01] fullofgringe: armor and mr buff as passive when rito
[4:01:04] Camille_step_on_me: Yea would be fun if Lucian was a stand alone champ not Enchanter extention
[4:01:10] HAZZALOL__: maybe more % dmg when hitting many double attack @Jackspektra
[4:01:13] HAZZALOL__: that would be something
[4:01:14] Zifi1: @Zedifed twitter
[4:01:31] stellr5: where does i see crit bufs?
[4:01:32] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!
[4:01:54] Camille_step_on_me: yea hedodged the arrow I guess
[4:01:56] Sangy55: he flashed varus Q but still baited pyke in, that was clean
[4:02:06] DragonnIsKing: @Jackspektra do you need my ingame name for the LPP skin redeem?
[4:02:07] AdmiralEdgarGorgon: do you think Smolder would be more interesting if the burn was weaker but all his abilities applied it. Means his damage isn't just all Q
[4:02:08] ShienHersix: buen dia jack
[4:02:09] Samooooth: Aren't u upset about zeri stat? she was supposed to be an MS kiting god, she just became a burst shit @Jackspektra
[4:02:12] Zedifed: @Zifi1 Very helpful, thanks
[4:02:15] ShienHersix: hace dias que no te podia ver. te extrañe
[4:02:19] RukiHyena: MS such an op stat this season
[4:02:57] ingrato1891: is senna good for adc after patch?
[4:02:59] Piksol_LoL: what you think about smolder after hotfix?
[4:03:05] Samooooth: ill spend so much to see range and ms back for less damages
[4:03:19] Camille_step_on_me: Zeri could've been like a mosquito annoying flying around but if she stops you just one shot her
[4:03:45] ShienHersix: que estamos escuchando? skap?
[4:04:06] Aura_Jakkaru: Early mid game feels soo much worse than b4 on smolder now
[4:04:15] TIBET1337: how are we today bboss
[4:04:16] Aura_Jakkaru: E perma useless dmg wise
[4:04:18] RukiHyena: i think E still worth ranks for lower cd on smolder
[4:04:21] Camille_step_on_me: How are you enjoying Bloodsong supps as an ADC? xdd
[4:04:27] nagromjames: are you searching or waiting for food?
[4:05:12] theboostishere: thoughts on supp items?
[4:05:42] Aniki_The_Forbidden_One: the identity of adc and support at the same time just does not work
[4:05:49] Aura_Jakkaru: I dont understand the e change cause in the patch notes they said they wanted to insensitive smolder interacting and going in more with e. They suceeded in that and then just killed it making him almost never see more than 7 shots in a game
[4:05:51] RukiHyena: senna is riots AD lux, they're always going to keep her good for skins. that's that rito bias imo

[4:06:09] Aura_Jakkaru: If they're gonna have it that way they should atleast up the ad ratio to make his lesser shots matter more
[4:06:15] Multi_bella: Playing against senna makes me feel worse than playing with one though
[4:06:30] Samooooth: They just make her a support to match xayah rakan thinggy but without any synergie or buff for lucian KEKW
[4:06:47] Dragdar: Support income reduction next patch might just push her into an adc a little more hopefully
[4:07:18] Piksol_LoL: fun part is that the dudde ffing(danny1018) plays tier2 in pcs

[4:08:49] zeyadhossam3: she why did it type shit xdd
[4:09:03] kozak_lul: if u open sup list, you`ll see so much champs that is playble rn
[4:09:13] Piksol_LoL: do you enjoy fasting Senna, Jack? I'd rather just farm
[4:09:13] kun1231231: you think dravens main build will be ie bt or still lethality with buffs?
[4:09:15] kozak_lul: but when i play adc, its always 3-4 champs meta
[4:09:19] zeyadhossam3: @RukiHyena she is not that broken there are some better ADCs
[4:09:32] Camille_step_on_me: @kozak_lul and so many new in rotation like Camille meanwhile ADC locked with same 15 xdd
[4:10:02] RukiHyena: @zeyadhossam3 she's >53%wr at all ranks, she's broken my dude.
[4:10:09] 1Nickles: you no brain ?
[4:10:12] 1Nickles: lol

[4:12:40] RukiHyena: @zeyadhossam3 talon effect, popular champs will have a lower winrate by default.
[4:13:30] 1Nickles: they're discussing if senna is broken ornot
[4:13:49] SingularFish: Borgir

[4:14:23] geo_1: yo beast hows it going
[4:14:30] Aura_Jakkaru: @jackspektra do you think since they want smolder e to be more interactive, instead of missing with shot numbers they just mess with the ad ratio to be more impactful but not as overbearing as getting machine gunned down
