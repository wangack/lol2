[0:05:17] VantageS4: @santorin I've been watching your streams a lot more recently and the way you approach the game has been making me want to play league again. I stopped playing because of toxicity, but you always seem a lot more positive than other junglers.

[1:24:21] Owlcopwn: Kappa
[1:24:34] aeroiswell: EU queue is better since they can actually get scouted into a team. NA just imports people PogChamp

[1:26:23] Praetor_GG: @criticwhospeaksfacts they don't innovate, it's how they get beat when it happens
[1:26:54] Praetor_GG: KR's strength is consistency and discipline, side effect of that is lack of creativity
[1:26:55] hernameisunforgetable: i mean isnt that the purpose of this academy league?
[1:26:57] Owlcopwn: @Praetor_GG ??? korea invented double ad bot lane and has been stomping with it

[1:27:47] Praetor_GG: @Owlcopwn Riot invented that, they look at numbers and do math, other regions lack mechanics to do that
[1:27:48] noonifer: Santorin is wukong viable?
[1:28:14] Owlcopwn: @Praetor_GG korea had the creativity to pull it out though, thats still innovating
[1:28:18] Praetor_GG: innovation is more abstract then just team comp variatrion
[1:28:31] aeroiswell: it only matters who's watching LUL

[2:40:16] Mve_Ur_Bdy: Nothing beats Friday Fiestas lets be honest
[2:40:22] Rodacon: Santorin's probably played a lot of Sejuani over the years LUL
[2:40:36] 다나나3: She is like sup kaisa
[2:40:58] lardyparty: what was that kaisa ult ....
[2:41:44] chillingin_tv: yeah but 300g going to naut and kaisa so its less worth

[2:43:44] peonsrage: @Santorin this is not the Vi play I was hoping to see Sadge
[2:44:24] geralt360: @Santorin can you play some brair
[2:44:28] drewfasaaa: kaisa no boots

[2:46:22] 67se: wtf why did gwen split
[2:46:38] 다나나3: What a fat wall
[2:46:42] lardyparty: I swear baron buffs are more of a curse than buff
[2:47:09] TheExceeds: To be fair basing b4 teammate start int play is good in soloq imo
[2:47:23] TheExceeds: instead of making ur team feel like theres back up and go in
[2:47:32] 67se: @TheExceeds good point if they need it
[2:47:34] peonsrage: @lardyparty Is it some secret that when you get baron you are to immediately team fight in enemy jungle and lose it?
[2:47:56] peonsrage: @lardyparty because that is the real curse of Baron lol
[2:48:12] UncleLaz_: why does your screen go so red when aatrox hiots you?
[2:48:42] UncleLaz_: ahhh i see, thank you. i dont play the bear
[2:48:52] lardyparty: @peonsrage haha yeah exactly
[2:49:06] Someone_44: hope you're having a wonderful day king

[2:49:17] peonsrage: almost 3 times champion, that smolder
[2:49:21] lardyparty: @yellowmikey it sure is a league of legends game

[2:49:38] normacismynamebackwards: i play yorick jg. i think he's such a strong pick and no one elsep lays it
[2:50:17] SeeBeeSee: vi threw that pretty badly
[2:50:18] lardyparty: gg
[2:50:41] chuyito_forreal: SeemsGood
[2:50:49] 67se: ggez
[2:50:58] UncleLaz_: gotta just give it if youre vI tthere
[2:51:00] UncleLaz_: take the L
[2:51:01] SeeBeeSee: she did ult in at 60% hp though
[2:51:01] brightdiscord: league of legends is a psychological game
[2:51:11] SeeBeeSee: would it have been better to stall and reset?
[2:51:56] SeeBeeSee: sure. always up for a lesson
[2:52:33] 67se: monkas if vi took baron
[2:52:38] legendod1: vi didnt throw. has to go in or lose n the game lol
[2:52:52] 67se: @legendod1 lol pretty much
[2:53:05] SeeBeeSee: damned if you do, damned if you don't, then.
[2:53:18] lardyparty: he was too squishy with that triforce build
[2:53:19] Auroramarie8008: Auroramarie8008 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! gloomi1Wiggle
[2:53:20] 67se: @legendod1 in fact exactly she has no choice
[2:53:30] legendod1: @67se right
[2:53:33] UncleLaz_: @legendod1 better to give it and stay back and pray for a good fight than go in and pray for a hail mary play
[2:53:53] UncleLaz_: shes taking the smallest of chances that shes going to steal it with where her team is
[2:53:54] legendod1: @UncleLaz_ if she gives they lose 100 percent. cant give
[2:54:13] peonsrage: that smolder ult is ridiculous lol
[2:54:23] UncleLaz_: theres like a 2% chance she steals it there. theres a better chance they win after
[2:54:23] 67se: follow the tank or the carry
[2:54:24] peonsrage: every time I hear the sound I'm thinking I'm watching Jurassic park
[2:54:26] lardyparty: nice run down
[2:54:33] SeeBeeSee: hwei backed, aatrox is coming back from top. it was a rough situation for her all around
[2:54:35] solidussovis: Vi could have cheese won that fight with GA early
[2:54:38] rockboy_tv: Can we get a Lee game?
[2:54:55] lardyparty: I love how much empathy junglers have for each other LUL missed smites, engages
[2:55:27] 67se: @solidussovis that's very almost too specific
[2:55:31] lilterp_: thats why u just become a happy go lucky supp main
[2:55:33] Ancarage: yeaaa and in situation like that you kinda need your team to instantly check with you
[2:55:47] Sylvain269: @lardyparty Same, I have insurmountable empathy and compassion for my fellow junglers UNLESS you're current pro players
[2:55:57] 67se: YEP supports do stay back
[2:55:58] Ancarage: but it is kinda hard to do on solo queue being the choas that it is
[2:56:00] Ancarage: YEP
[2:56:01] SeeBeeSee: @lilterp_ mfw I feel like I'm not mechanically skilled enough to make a difference as support FeelsBadMan
[2:56:11] lardyparty: you need the viego human king skin...wtv the fk its called. such clean animations
[2:56:48] Sylvain269: @SeeBeeSee You don't need to be
[2:57:00] Ancarage: @lardyparty cause you only understand what it means to yolo 5050 baron/dragon play is once you play jg YEP

[3:42:53] iiNumb3rz: Vi stands for very annoying for the enemy carry
[3:43:02] peonsrage: @iiNumb3rz most of my games, everyone attacks the tanks so I figure I might as well help with natural armor shred before BC lol
[3:43:31] wollfwing: That's also why cosmic is so nice, making the enemy flash with yours and then using the time you have flash back and they don't feels amazing
[3:43:46] iiNumb3rz: I've been playing vi and veigo. I play vi when my team locks zero engage.
[3:44:16] peonsrage: @iiNumb3rz I tried Viego, thinking it's just vi with an ego but, well it is and I lack the ego. lol
[3:44:52] Sylvain269: @Northlane0 Oh yeah Midwesterners are really nice, right?
[3:44:57] iiNumb3rz: Viego prefers to have another champ engage first then you go in. If your primary engage on viego it can get tough to get resets.
[3:45:01] wollfwing: Mao still being strong is just so ugh
[3:45:22] ledecapiteur_01: is Santorin from the best region or from EU ?
[3:45:41] iiNumb3rz: Santorin is the goat

[3:46:10] peonsrage: @iiNumb3rz What's a pink? YEP

[3:55:38] peonsrage: as an Iron 2 player, absolutely. Literally why I play Vi.
[3:55:44] wollfwing: It feels so nice when you just did a giga engage and win the fight off it

[3:55:53] peonsrage: I play Ornn and Sion top because engage
[3:56:08] CESlush: but in low elo, the tanks pick a tank champ, and then run away from fights, wait for you to engage, and make you go first into the dark
