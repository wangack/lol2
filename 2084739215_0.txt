[1:11:04] shedfirekid1: eggie down kaypUpsetti
[1:11:07] Nadro: it was in this moment, she knew, she messed up nickiSadge
[1:11:20] Meekzii: r u na or eu?
[1:11:28] liraj2: next time when u have the passive use tp before dying
[1:11:54] Nadro: how have you found using tp over barrier Kels?
[1:12:24] Jaguar542: @Meekzii She plays on EUW right now
[1:12:30] TheLiin: tp is so good on anivia
[1:12:38] Meekzii: but living in na? how her ping so low
[1:13:02] J_to_the_jf: malignance is great on anivia for that
[1:13:14] Niomah: @Meekzii she's in EU
[1:13:30] TheLiin: anivia shouldnt be forced out of mid in 99% of games, but lower elo botlanes dont understand that
[1:13:32] Meekzii: oh sorry! gotcha thanks
[1:13:52] ajak636: kaypRonin
[1:14:16] ObsceneSanity: @TheLiin bc every adc guide out there tells you to take mid lane
[1:14:32] shedfirekid1: believers have it
[1:14:33] jexuzd: I played galio the other day and i did exactly that but faster
[1:15:04] ObsceneSanity: im not saying its the right play, bc how weak the role is right now, just saying it is what every guide is doing
[1:15:11] LZ_cocowww: Hey kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypCheer kaypFlower
[1:15:17] imperialninja: you got some good songs goin on today @KayPea
[1:15:29] TheLiin: @ObsceneSanity it is the right play with most midlaners, but a couple control mages shouldnt be side
[1:16:02] TheDylanBlack: that singed grab was BS
[1:16:19] shedfirekid1: I think the animation went before the wall went up maybe
[1:16:24] ObsceneSanity: @TheLiin true. I find success as a xer mid, to hover the side lane closest to next obj. in hopes my jungler will be close
[1:16:24] Chocolatemalky: real and true
[1:16:25] J_to_the_jf: hit the button same time as you walled probably
[1:16:27] DragoonRed: singed can grab people over small walls range > wall
[1:16:30] cedh2o: @shedfirekid1 yeah this
[1:16:41] Jaguar542: Cool Anivia can perform parkour like Talon!
[1:17:01] jexuzd: Thats the same when you flash out of a AA of a meele champ and still hits you
[1:17:20] shedfirekid1: @jexuzd exactly
[1:17:29] fearlessterp: batnivia?!?
[1:18:08] DigBickDamage: Alright friends, its time for me to get out here. You all have a fantastic day and good luck on the games Kay!

[1:20:08] kyunoez: Hey Kels, do you have any tips for climbing this season, I just can't get past g1
[1:20:37] ObsceneSanity: how behind is your adc?
[1:20:39] via_trita: is "all in" not the same or close?
[1:20:56] shedfirekid1: @kyunoez get lucky with matchmaking honestly. this season is terrible for it and everyone is struggling more than ever
[1:21:15] liamae3: @KayPea are you watching LEC matchs usually ?
[1:21:35] shedfirekid1: @kyunoez I‚Äôve been minimum gold since season 4 and I cannot get out of silver this season. teams don‚Äôt work together or run it down
[1:21:56] kyunoez: @shedfirekid1 I feel that, thank you friendo
[1:22:16] jexuzd: How is riot still givin new champions when theres a lot of bs old mechanics champions
[1:22:19] shedfirekid1: @kyunoez no problem! you‚Äôll hit plat soon enough kaypCheer
[1:22:25] Jazzoholic: do ahri dashes go through walls?
[1:22:40] DragoonRed: @Jazzoholic yes
[1:22:54] via_trita: I hate that Anivia's wall doesn't "exist" until the animations almost over
[1:23:21] shedfirekid1: wow this game took a serious turn
[1:23:26] Telfus: she backed, she has baron
[1:23:31] jexuzd: Theres champions that need rework asap, their simple snd old mechanics make them busted on current patch
[1:24:16] maurovichs: Hello everyone
[1:24:36] shedfirekid1: you keep getting dive bombed by yi and singed, hard to be in fights for you
[1:24:59] druidcaster: i think she was though , but she got bursted and backed towards the end of the fight quickly with her baron recall
[1:25:00] LordEmillo: she was at the start iirc
[1:25:03] Jaguar542: Just looked in vod, Xayah were in the fight from the beginning she recalled with like 100 hp
[1:25:12] Niomah: Shen and Rakan need to be frontlining so they don't get to you
[1:25:20] shedfirekid1: perfect example right there
[1:25:31] Niomah: Rakan is all the way in the back of the fight, being useless
[1:25:35] kyunoez: There twiddling there thumbs
[1:25:46] kyunoez: They're*
[1:26:00] Niomah: front liners not frontlining bleh
[1:26:06] jexuzd: It was the easyest wombo combo there
[1:26:31] shedfirekid1: ‚Äúwow this guy is ballsy, maybe we should let him be‚Äù - KP team

[1:27:37] homantic: sometimes there‚Äôs no synergy :(

[2:44:28] DrBallHawk: it wasn‚Äôt a direct buff. they updated the tick rate or something on the servers so his Q is more responsive
[2:44:28] kaos7489: Last time I played was when Darius had just come out
[2:44:40] kaos7489: So may of 2012
[2:45:13] DrBallHawk: so he‚Äôs a lot more effective as a support. blinding Jhins 4th shot etc. he‚Äôs at like a 54% WR as support

[3:05:39] Oshanley: @KayPea I had such a satisfying win last night on league. Me and my buddy hard carried from bot lane. With him being on samira and i was on rell. Our top udyr dc'd at minute 9 of the game and our team wanted to surrender

[3:07:19] Marleenu: in eune soloq in low diamond i had to do 93k damage in 40 minute game to win.. it was hell.. migth have shed a tear if i lost that one...
[3:07:34] Oshanley: Yeah they had our base cracked and everything and we 2v5'd at bot inhib tower and my buddy got a penta and he just hard snowballed after that

[3:11:21] SpiderSleeping: bro a league player taking responsibility, have i teleported to another universe
[3:11:28] tehbluehue: @heda80085 I found it its actually a badge you can change but yah thats probably how its triggered
[3:11:46] FiveFM: Good wombo clip though!
[3:11:54] heisenberg3150: Unlucky
[3:12:08] J0LLYR0GER: Ori seems pretty dang strong right now am I crazy???
[3:12:20] Vigilante_Crab: kill responsibly
[3:12:35] Oshanley: Yeah we ended after that game because that was too much of a good game to play another after. It was just so gratifying to win when the team had given up and didnt trust us to carry. They were super quiet when we destroyed their base
[3:12:36] Marleenu: lich ahri is kinda nuts atm ngl
[3:12:37] BigTiddyTV: @SpiderSleeping thats what you realize about KP she has the mentality every league player wishes they had
[3:12:37] kimbrxq: well, happens to the best of us. but you are taking a responsibility for it so mad respect for that instead of flaming everyone else like most leauge players do <3
[3:12:53] sexytotoro: do you not type?
[3:13:28] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea I will say its frustrating when you are solo carrying and you know if you literally fuck up once the entire game is over
[3:13:57] ItsAMoll: i wanna be good with Taliyah so bad but hitting her combo is hard :/
[3:14:03] SpiderSleeping: typing is 99% a waste of time. the only things i think help are 'group' 'mid' 'baron' and 'end'
[3:14:06] inSINwetrust: I think WR have that ping

[3:15:05] padtime: is why i turn chat off
[3:15:09] SpiderSleeping: LUL
[3:15:20] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea Another thing is people dont know you have to play differnet if you are being carried by one player. You need to play around them and adjust what you are doing
[3:15:50] SpiderSleeping: people miss CS when they type and are distracted from playing
[3:15:50] Marleenu: @J0LLYR0GER people have the biggest ego in league.. it rarely happens
[3:15:52] Moonahris: hello, how are the games going today? kaypArrive
[3:16:14] SpiderSleeping: he thought it was his moment

[3:42:37] Jaketin8: @lilCACTUSS9 Yeah, sometimes it feels like there is nothing you can do againts them, you sit back and farm? you lose. You actively fight and try to kill them? You lose. You try to sit back and poke them away? You lose. Like why do high mobility champs have more burst/dmg overall than low mobility mages, makes no sense
[3:42:40] lilCACTUSS9: Maybe it's too long. didn't know if you needed the Cait included or only the fight after her death @KayPea
