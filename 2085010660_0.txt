[1:33:12] ItsChimeTime: cause he passed santroin not cause it got 3009 xD
[1:33:13] BandOfPonies: sometimes u walk out of turret range and it drops aggro but you walk back in and it reaggros you somehow
[1:33:14] jeby: u get the award for being cute
[1:33:15] nangs_1337: we're your award pob

[1:33:44] DIRT_NERD: smolder is gonna be full stacked 18 min
[1:33:50] the_tozo: it helps that smolder is like broken this patch
[1:33:54] Kluzien: that character is broken
[1:34:15] DIRT_NERD: does the smolder q not go thru to backline on xin r?
[1:34:16] d1a_lol: what rhymes with where all dream's meet? briar's feet BriarFeet
[1:34:17] Farre17: is jayce consider high range or mobile?
[1:34:18] OnlyPidgeon: naut taking his stacks, report
[1:34:24] BeefBiggly: they have mad cc - smolder will play off of that
[1:34:26] x_TDeck_x: LCS is live patch but they probably dont get hotfixes, right?

[1:35:56] CapnKarlos: I had it in my gold game. He tanky
[1:36:15] OnlyPidgeon: is because irelia or trundle with jayce build would won 1vs3, but jayce barely can win 1vs1
[1:36:22] tinfoilslayer: Karma is Azir
[1:36:22] MyFriendHasADog: i think karma is better with a team of carries that you can support like this game, but she is definitely overpicked
[1:36:26] MageWrecker: bwipo is just missing q from fog?
[1:36:27] assoun24: pob... you saying these names wrong... a lot...
[1:36:31] aln045: bears eat fruit?
[1:36:43] FMJayce: Eclipse Into Sundered 2nd unless Muramana stacked then whichever I didn't build 3rd I get is the build I've really been enjoying @Pobelter
[1:36:44] ZoneArch: @aln045 they do
[1:36:45] isweartogod: bears eat everything
[1:36:46] lardyparty: karma R E with sivir R sounds busted
[1:36:56] DIRT_NERD: smolder is so op in solo q because there are so many random skirmishes u can just farm stacks on
[1:37:12] Omrilavy200: wait a sec asol?
[1:37:29] yaoireedaa: well they already had 2

[1:42:13] shineelight: unironically asol and smolder zoning ult is crazy there
[1:42:15] Ophirr: Fly needs tl to engage on them so they can kite back
[1:42:18] cw8smith: that guy just drew a circle around all 10 people in a fight
[1:42:18] Hagoo: flyquests backline is so short range they get zoned from a single smolder E
[1:42:23] DIRT_NERD: he needs sireldya if they are fighting like this
[1:42:24] x_TDeck_x: jayce wanted to brawl with renekton over everything else ig

[1:42:43] mcegginton: Sundered on Jayce?
[1:42:44] nightwingx_88: @the_tozo he did
[1:42:50] DIRT_NERD: his e connected with asol as he flashed so he went further than expected
[1:42:52] jeby: he was proving that he was killable
[1:42:53] PhoenixTheFiery: he needs to make backline killable of an eq
[1:42:55] zerodatman420: is brusier Bwipo jayce a thing or is he trolling
[1:43:04] Omrilavy200: told you he went zonie
[1:43:07] x_TDeck_x: I feel like once Xin had sundered, they should have been constantly looking
[1:43:08] g97cj39sdkvhkkly: what is the logic behind that jayce build?
[1:43:20] nLGroove_: @Pobelter do you still play competetive
[1:43:40] grachusbabeuf: !cocksize
[1:43:49] jeffjam: pobPonyocheer
[1:43:50] Ophirr: I still don't think jayce was the pick this game, feel like winning lane vs renek is so much less important than giving fly some cc to work wiht
[1:43:51] ZoneArch: LCS is just filled with frauds this season

[1:45:13] OnlyPidgeon: I pretty sure that he aint happy at this moment about it

[1:45:19] DIRT_NERD: 3010 assists POGGIES

[1:46:09] KnightmareN54: How useless is Sivir here xdxd
[1:46:13] Kluzien: i hate aurelion sol Madge
[1:46:16] slurriel_: TL just scaled for free I guess
[1:46:17] x_TDeck_x: fly 2nd half split rough :(
[1:46:17] Kelbotay: corejj hooks FailFish
[1:46:17] comeman_pro: I owe you an apology APA
[1:46:19] Ophirr: That 4th drag fight would have been so different with just an ornn right?
[1:46:19] the_tozo: 225 smolder actually just wins
[1:46:23] ScaryDavis: get jensen off karma NOW
[1:46:24] salamentic1: Dude why are they so crazy for asol, is that how you play these fights?
[1:46:31] tinfoilslayer: crit jayce lol
[1:46:32] MageWrecker: idk man fly looked kinda bad this game
[1:46:36] yaoireedaa: but everyone voted fly
[1:46:42] Numb3Rz18: SIVIR NO DAMAGE! IN BOTH GAMES!
[1:46:42] keletys: has sivir even won one game this split? i havent watched everything but every time i see her she looks mega useless
[1:46:46] Omrilavy200: @Pobelter do you think asol is good in chall lobbys?
[1:46:58] Morrygu: if bwipo isn't win con flyquest struggle
[1:46:58] OnlyPidgeon: I mean if you have that xin with karma and sivir you go all out in every chance, but they were like "lets wait"
[1:46:58] KnightmareN54: @Pobelter What is the use of sivir pick here
[1:47:08] Kluzien: is this jayce build a real build?
[1:47:13] empwixxy: Again tbh karma did nothing in teamfights
[1:47:15] assoun24: to me i think its all inspired, he had a bad flash ult earlier but to me hes the reason this team is great
[1:47:20] KingsEntourage: FlyQuest has multiple big opinions who each one plays/believes different ideas. So they are never really on the same page
[1:47:24] nLGroove_: @Pobelter did you stopped playing competetively
[1:47:27] nannyzpq: how does smolder make it through pick/ban????
[1:47:31] OnlyPidgeon: oh no
[1:47:34] OnlyPidgeon: they deadge
[1:47:34] DIRT_NERD: think the concept is to try to deny stacks but like..
[1:47:41] ZoneArch: Impact 3v1
[1:47:44] Shrimpanzie: i feel like this jayce build has no damage
[1:47:50] trycolm: impact 3v1
[1:47:55] nannyzpq: bro karma feels so useless here
[1:47:57] MageWrecker: sivir is hitting renekton for 10 seconds straight and doing no damage
[1:48:00] KnightmareN54: Like does it not feel like Sivir cannot walk up to auto with Smolder/ASol??
[1:48:02] x_TDeck_x: APA my goat
[1:48:02] zerodatman420: bwipo is limit testing I guess
[1:48:08] Hagoo: they making APA look good oh lawd
[1:48:10] yaoireedaa: aurelion looking good
[1:48:11] vinao_de_del_rey: at least fly are trying to come back

[3:17:53] jeffjam: but then you cant see the map
[3:17:54] rayster5431: @l_houss thats dumb
[3:18:01] jcvargas44: @l_houss u are joking if you think having the map visible is not important
[3:18:16] rayster5431: id rather see the map than player cams
[3:18:16] Aquamelt: do they have enough damage with aatrox this far behind?
[3:18:23] l_houss: im joking wtf ..
[3:18:23] BelatedWT: feel like NRG just have so much engage. able to control fights a lot no?
[3:18:31] jcvargas44: @l_houss surely mate

[3:19:00] koushik_10: why not sundered sky second instead of black cleaver?
[3:19:17] puff_king: @pobelter when on stage are players scared to start some plays?
[3:19:23] meelor_: can put cam on top of the screnen with neeko spells and summs
[3:19:26] rrrammo: nrg is playing well
[3:19:49] smugsub_elnubnub: nrg has a LOT of practice of stalling mid game from all their early game fumbles
[3:20:02] ThexCoolxOsos: nrg is not letting them have any play opportunities

[3:21:58] GHOST97915: i dont understand why they are allowing NRG back into this game
[3:22:39] Aquamelt: once varus gets terminus jaksho seems sort of hard for NRG to win
[3:22:39] twohernias: why is sej building mr
[3:22:44] jcvargas44: malignance not good on neeko?
[3:23:03] Dummytheus: It lines up her ult timer with her teammates
[3:23:27] j0etheshow: what is that senna skin?
[3:23:34] DictatorshipProletariat: aatrox building lethality is so sad. bruiser build is way more fun to watch
[3:24:02] SonOfJo: I feel like dhokla has not looked recently
[3:24:07] SonOfJo: Not looked good*
[3:24:12] Dummytheus: mid game is tough for them.. Senna waiting room
[3:24:15] smugsub_elnubnub: one more item and aatrox starts to do giga-dam
[3:24:16] SmalIDickBigHeart: why do we call the team by the sponsor name?
[3:24:18] ebb11: both teams so passive
[3:24:19] Flygone3: wuking impact is not showing up
[3:24:26] blastboys123: i eman they kind have already tanky front line with neeko and sejuani
[3:24:33] exhila: dhokla been pretty mid second half of the season hopefully he picks it up in playoffs i really like him as a player
[3:24:34] Dummytheus: I feel like lethality senna is a mistake
[3:24:35] born___confused: YEP croc

[3:26:15] alaksande: Huhu wukong HUH
[3:26:19] h0chh: contractz???????????????
[3:26:23] meowjification: NRG have felt so uncoordinated every fight, always focusing seperately
[3:26:54] koushik_10: bro lcs teams need to stop trying lck comps man just play full scaling comps if u want to scale to late game
[3:26:56] Rismoury: Aware  Tank Varus

[3:27:20] alaksande: I dont like team comps that stack lethality
[3:27:22] koushik_10: like there was no setup the whole game for neeko or aatrox
[3:27:22] Dummytheus: NRG could have won by matching the frontline and relying on senna outscale
[3:27:37] BandOfPonies: I just got back was pobelters tweet featured #nrgwin
[3:27:57] oKPI: he didn't tweet but we had it on lock @BandOfPonies
[3:28:04] Bear_IRL: @BandOfPonies he didn't even tweet anything UltraMad
[3:28:05] oKPI: can win

[3:30:17] circuitlies: what a neat champion
[3:30:19] meowjification: if they just play front to back with neeko/wu threatening with clones I feel like NRG win, this split focus is completely making their comp a waste, Senna and neeko should be untouchable, just like varus, no need to foce onto varus
[3:30:28] aranzaboi: thanks goodness for this pause!! now i can go microwave my Pagoda™ Eggrolls #ad

[7:12:07] little_man_ppc: What does weak side mean?
[7:12:29] Jakmo: @little_man_ppc plan to be ganked by their jungler and ignored by your own. you play to match and not die
[7:12:34] cozycoffin_: do you want duos back in master+?
[7:12:35] boxyy_au: is comet normal for aatrox against Jayce?
[7:12:55] Blaz29: @little_man_ppc means jyour jungler will totally forfeit you, basically you are on an island
[7:13:01] przyduszenie: @boxyy_au it seems dogshit idk what the guy cookin
[7:13:04] Mxsso23: guys noob question, if my enemy just decides to lose entire waves just to trade me, what should i do? do i trade back or do i just farm trying not to die?

[7:14:26] Jakmo: @Mxsso23 that's a crazy situational question, do you even want a generalization?
[7:14:39] little_man_ppc: @jakmo @blaz29 Ty but because of your jungle's pathing?
[7:15:03] devanpy: @Mxsso23 bunch of minions hurt a lot
[7:15:12] devanpy: IF u trade with a big wave of minions u should win unless u fk up big time
[7:15:13] lydontbesad: Why you advanced your steam time

[7:15:32] magdkhalid: Jayce is broken btw
[7:15:34] ttvdenisuru: jebaited. how tilting
[7:15:36] Blaz29: @little_man_ppc no, he just prioritizes other lannnes to make them snowball, while the weak side tries to match or nnot feed
[7:15:38] makinbakon: xdd
[7:15:42] Derp_sanity: im low elo. whats a "team"
[7:15:44] przyduszenie: @Mxsso23 you dont give him kill. you just let creeps die
[7:15:46] milkshakeguy15: i like santa?
[7:15:48] Jakmo: @little_man_ppc not always, but sometimes. If it's pretty clear that you're gankable for the enemy but your opponent isn't (champ, escapes, or you're the pushing player) you can be ignored. if the jungler should be focusing mid/bot because of free kills and match ups it'll happen
[7:16:34] Mxsso23: i mean, maybe i shouldnt play graspzir top in silver 2, but its too fun xdd

[7:17:04] Grommit90: CLIP IT AND SHIP IT
[7:17:04] OlliTrollie: huh
[7:17:06] Jakmo: @Mxsso23 ah, in that situation and matchups like it, you have to yield the early CS to not die, let the wave move toward you so you can farm, and neutralize their advantage. If they can just kill you for free they get their wave while you're dead and you don't get it
[7:17:10] aku89: needed to edge grom pmore
[7:17:12] NoUrATowel: yeah volis fault you die forsure
[7:17:49] Mxsso23: @Jakmo seems logic, just drop cs into lane bully
[7:17:49] BBurnz1: pob, how do you think riot could/should fix high elo autofill?
[7:18:12] Mxsso23: but i have the chovy mentality, 11 cs per minute must be obtained every game xdd
[7:18:43] Jakmo: @Mxsso23 oftentimes, yeah. if you go 0/0/0 in an unwinnable matchup but you're only 10-20 cs behind, that's good for the later game champ. remember that cs isn't always about cs/min, it can often be about cs/dif with your opponent in top lane specifically
[7:19:02] dixlowe: scorch gaming

[9:17:12] TorqueBandit: ChatGPT says this about LBJ: Lyndon B. Johnson, often abbreviated as LBJ, is most known for his presidency, particularly for his leadership during the turbulent 1960s. He's remembered for his "Great Society" domestic programs, civil rights legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as well as his escalation of the Vietnam War. Additionally, he is remembered for his skill in legislative politics and his complex personality.
