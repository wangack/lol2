[0:17:26] m_a_tty: :)
[0:17:41] Kylon1235: lol Bwipo and Sniper are both goats
[0:17:50] imibby_: viper u think you could still take on all the lcs toplaners
[0:19:26] Ayyyvi: OMG THE CAMMM
[0:19:47] Ayyyvi: HE GOT THE HAIRCUT AND TURNED ON CAM HANDSOME
[0:19:56] Kylon1235: WHHAT

[0:19:59] Facu_callejeros: wtf that healing xd
[0:20:02] Kylon1235: WHY DID THEY BUFF THAT
[0:20:05] makkedoo: WTFF
[0:22:01] Kylon1235: -1
[0:25:06] Amaresu_: dig had such a good draft this game but fought for no reason as sej karma early and gave a big lead. they can still win later but yone udyr can do whatever they want.
[0:26:03] Amaresu_: rich played well, he got rly griefed by his mid jg tho
[0:27:01] m_a_tty: i think he's right, if c9 doesn't push to end sooner rather than later, doulbe enchanter sivir is just gunna melt them
[0:27:23] Amaresu_: dove is perma missing DQs
[0:27:28] Amaresu_: RQs*
[0:28:18] Amaresu_: comp gap online
[0:28:20] Facu_callejeros: no one dies lol

[0:28:54] Kylon1235: @Amaresu_ ^
[0:29:15] CasiTV06: Are u guys seeying that adc Bvoy i think he is so good for the team he is
[0:29:44] Amaresu_: fudge should unironically build morello
[0:29:57] Amaresu_: yeah bvoy is good
[0:30:09] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[0:30:44] Amaresu_: randies is oprimal vs double crit, idk if it affects sundered sky crit too

[0:32:19] cdncore: Thieves vs Immortals game 3, TL vs Fly next
[0:32:27] Baldimir500: welcome back viper cam
[0:32:30] Baldimir500: AHHAAHHA
[0:34:10] xsomber: ur a little loud compared to olive i think
[0:34:19] Amaresu_: gg
[0:34:22] kceburst13: Costream lets gooo
[0:34:39] m_a_tty: felt like karma did nothing this game
[0:34:48] Amaresu_: dig misplayed big time early in mid jg, could ve won with draft gap in mid late if patient.
[0:35:37] ramstar08: i thought they would ban accounts that streamed the LCS ?
[0:35:58] Kylon1235: @ramstar08 he has permission
[0:37:06] suciopotterxd: ma boy viper w the camera !!
[0:37:12] hayIeywiIIiams: imo karma is bad into yone b/c his gap close
[0:37:31] LevitateNA: dove
[0:37:33] LevitateNA: ^
[0:37:46] lemonpuppy: yoooo costreaming <3

[0:40:40] serbington: double enchanter
[0:41:16] Amaresu_: i think sej isnt optimal but its fine. no reason for them to force fights in mid jg as sej karma early. go even dight 5v5 at drag and u autowin unless they giga outplay
[0:41:23] Nethenial: oh shit is that my boy
[0:41:27] sm0ker99: maokai
[0:41:35] sot3kala: maokai
[0:42:22] opChucks: why ban senna on pick1 side
[0:42:36] Kylon1235: if Fly loses and 100t wins than its 1st place tie again hmm
[0:42:50] Amaresu_: i agree with viper. its a 5v5 comp just pick wuk its perfect.
[0:42:59] xyz_abc: ohhh baby camera stream
[0:43:04] Amaresu_: and dmg split mid jg
[0:43:26] Amaresu_: reksai is good on live. 53 wr kr
[0:44:31] Amaresu_: they mind controlled themselves into picking sej cause thw had milio who is notorious hard coUnter for sej
[0:44:40] Amaresu_: they*
[0:45:15] opChucks: j4 strong too?
[0:45:17] Amaresu_: senna ban on blue side sus
[0:45:29] Massi_: is sniper still on 100T ?
[0:45:41] aaIiyahh: yes
[0:45:45] opChucks: i thought neeko was back
[0:46:04] Nidalee55: wait sniper went to pro play?
[0:46:14] Kylon1235: @Nidalee55 YEP
[0:46:17] Amaresu_: xdd
[0:46:20] Nidalee55: what a legend
[0:46:53] SharpedIllusion: Sniper is his brother right ?
[0:46:57] Kylon1235: @SharpedIllusion y
[0:46:58] opChucks: what about karma j4?
[0:47:05] xyz_abc: asol PogChamp
[0:47:25] Amaresu_: karma j4 is good but j4 is bad vs mobile carries like c9s last game
[0:48:00] Kylon1235: I would be rooting for TL so 100t has a chance to get back to top1 but I also want Bwipo to win
[0:48:02] Amaresu_: actual ziggs angle
[0:48:05] opChucks: j4 wukong vi meta at msi yet agin. mark my words
[0:48:25] Amaresu_: Aware
[0:48:35] Invincible12321: press f11?
[0:48:48] Kylon1235: Viper can u move cam for draft, last 2 fly picks blocked off
[0:48:51] Amaresu_: apa taliyah
[0:48:56] serbington: Galio voli would be strong no
[0:48:58] Amaresu_: vs rakan xin
[0:49:26] Amaresu_: oh i m blind taliyah an
[0:49:27] Nethenial: goated
[0:49:27] SolarFair: bruh im so dumb. olive said like 20 times he'd be here for costream but i forgot it was superweek
[0:49:33] Amaresu_: ban*
[0:50:13] Kylon1235: the Olaf ban, respecting Bwipo
[0:50:25] a7a234: YONE
[0:50:28] Amaresu_: nice
[0:50:35] Amaresu_: does he play it tho
[0:50:39] Amaresu_: oshit
[0:50:41] xPerfxction: what about syndra?
[0:50:42] xyz_abc: holy shit
[0:50:44] xyz_abc: i called the asol
[0:50:48] Amaresu_: too much late game
[0:50:52] Kylon1235: 2 dragons and a bear
[0:50:58] Kylon1235: and a croc
[0:51:01] Kylon1235: huh
[0:51:04] Nethenial: unless tl wins
[0:51:10] Nethenial: then tl draft is smart
[0:51:10] Amaresu_: volibear with 2 late game carries, guess he can camp top
[0:51:35] SolarFair: my mental health has been in decline every time i watch TL draft
[0:51:41] Amaresu_: he s gonna get so camped on jayce
[0:51:50] Amaresu_: vs renekton voli
[0:51:59] Amaresu_: only lane that voli can go is top
[0:52:09] Amaresu_: 0/10 bwipo game
[0:52:32] opChucks: fly no frontline wtf
[0:52:44] Kylon1235: I think TL won draft
[0:52:56] SolarFair: any thoughts on the botlane matchup?
[0:53:05] Kylon1235: Fly only chance is to scale
[0:53:12] rocketmatbu: when is Sniper's match ?
[0:53:17] Kylon1235: @rocketmatbu after this one
[0:53:17] rocketmatbu: hi btw !
[0:53:21] yaBrad: GAMBA
[0:53:23] Amaresu_: tl draft hinges on renek voli naut goon squad camping jayce and getting grubs to bridge the 2 dragons to late game
[0:53:28] rocketmatbu: @Kylon1235 ty bro
[0:53:35] SolarFair: how much better would the draft be if it was hewi instead of asol?
[0:53:50] 3251Yami: Clean haircut damnn
[0:53:56] Amaresu_: alphari my goat
[0:54:07] Amaresu_: best western top ever
[0:54:24] SolarFair: really? i only saw him on gnar
[0:54:32] cdncore: both are good
[0:54:33] TomGotMono: There
[0:54:36] rocketmatbu: here
[0:54:38] Kylon1235: current spot is good
[0:54:39] Amaresu_: bot left
[0:54:44] kristiee: is good
[0:54:47] yaBrad: that‚Äôs good
[0:54:51] Kylon1235: either are ok tbh
[0:55:00] Amaresu_: its fine u only miss stacks
[0:55:02] yaBrad: MOD gamba?
[0:55:03] SolarFair: what about covering playercam?
[0:55:04] Pinkaoz: like this is good
[0:55:10] Amaresu_: and u can let us know
[0:55:22] StateoftheeArt: Make 20 scenes, and replace the champ portraits with your face
[0:55:39] Amaresu_: bwipo dead in 10s
[0:56:16] Amaresu_: he s oom xd
[0:56:39] yaBrad: Jayce already oom
[0:56:42] Amaresu_: if i dont see voli naut gank jayce i m fuming
[0:56:55] Amaresu_: easy
[0:56:57] StateoftheeArt: IMO they should disable skins in comp matches
[0:58:36] Amaresu_: he contested him on the wave and jayce hasmconq...
[0:58:46] macg10: is jensen not an inter anymore?
[0:59:38] Amaresu_: if you re not going tear the only item that makes sense is shojin bruiser jayce
[0:59:46] xyz_abc: that was troll as fuck
[0:59:57] 3251Yami: Karma fayosaAngry
[1:00:17] Kylon1235: wtf TL
[1:00:55] Amaresu_: both c9 and fq getting away with so much these games cause dig and tl do random shit
[1:02:07] Amaresu_: he either buys tear now or goes shojin for combat stats
[1:02:19] SolarFair: its weird because apa was like the asol guy, but its only because he was a onetrick on old asol
[1:02:32] xyz_abc: bc?
[1:02:35] Nethenial: block cleaver maybe
[1:02:39] yaBrad: streams?
[1:02:40] Amaresu_: cleaver but its for the ms
[1:02:48] yaBrad: steraks?
[1:02:48] Nethenial: does that build into titanic?
[1:04:47] xyz_abc: huh
[1:04:48] Amaresu_: yikes
[1:04:51] SolarFair: that flash
[1:04:57] mital25: viper the goat
[1:05:10] SolarFair: im getting hari flashbacks
[1:06:34] Amaresu_: oh he s going stride
[1:06:38] Amaresu_: makes sense
[1:06:53] Amaresu_: worth
[1:07:22] Amaresu_: i like stride renek this game
[1:09:09] Amaresu_: 25 is fine if they can get a drake with big asol R
[1:09:12] iHizix: hi
[1:09:15] Amaresu_: to delay soul
[1:09:22] lufri_: 20 is like very good if even game
[1:09:46] Amaresu_: think of big asol R like corki package
[1:09:54] xyz_abc: also when he hits 225 hes so op
[1:10:07] Amaresu_: but games have been going late all the time in every region even in soloQ
[1:10:14] Amaresu_: asol just needs 2 items
[1:10:19] Amaresu_: rylais liandries gg
[1:11:46] SolarFair: are hexgates still in the game?
[1:11:55] Amaresu_: umti is so yolo 24/7
[1:12:13] Amaresu_: yes solar, on hextech rift
[1:13:02] RexMundiDeus: lmao no offense but vipers voice doesnt fit the body, just like ronnie coleman. haha
[1:13:17] SolarFair: @Amaresu_ ty
[1:13:18] Amaresu_: asol at 2 items does more than everyone xD
[1:14:03] Kylon1235: riven build on jayce xd
[1:14:04] xPerfxction: @Amaresu_ asol e is like some full champions at those 2 items xd
[1:14:35] Amaresu_: shojin is better than this if u wanna go bruiser jayce
[1:14:44] Amaresu_: @xperfxction exactly
[1:14:53] Amaresu_: watch 2 item asol big ult at soul
[1:15:25] DevondRiven: thats actually a kind of crazy comp besides being low range, you got voli naut renekton for early game and then great scaling for late with mid and adc
[1:15:40] SolarFair: i always forget renekton breaks shields now
[1:15:40] Amaresu_: ace for tl inbound
[1:15:50] Sunflash_: CoreJJ kek
[1:16:17] Amaresu_: told u
[1:16:18] xyz_abc: flyquest boom

[1:16:32] xPerfxction: now its over anyway
[1:16:42] micsp1mgod: brotha sold
[1:16:45] Amaresu_: they wanted to oneshot apa before he ulrs
[1:16:49] opChucks: gg
[1:16:49] xPerfxction: at this point if he doesnt hard int on smolder its gg
[1:16:55] Amaresu_: kinda like catching corki b4 package
[1:16:57] Pinkaoz: why are they fighting now when smolder has stacks and asol has stacked ult
[1:17:22] Amaresu_: but the real play is to give this drag and go baron for fq
[1:17:25] SolarFair: lol
[1:17:43] x6f9r: !followage

[1:21:39] salega96: @xPerfxction he oversalt
[1:21:54] SolarFair: can we talk about how the steraks on inspired did nothing at the 4th dragon fight
[1:22:17] Amaresu_: they used renek voli naut 3 man ro bridge them over. top dive was rly good and 4th drag was trolled by fq
[1:22:36] Amaresu_: gg
[1:23:10] UZIRedd: asol so cringe
