[0:46:29] shadowymisstep: I don't even remember when I got Prime
[0:46:38] shadowymisstep: Tim's is trash tier now imo
[0:46:44] yarados_: yeah it is
[0:47:04] duckpinbowler: what is Tim‚Äôs? is that a Canadian thing?
[0:47:10] yarados_: Tim Hortons
[0:47:10] NoxParagon: TIm Hortens
[0:47:11] shadowymisstep: FUN FACT: McDonald's actually sniped Tim's coffee bean supplier like. A decade ago
[0:47:16] NoxParagon: Its in the states
[0:47:16] KentossBOREC: do you like the new font?
[0:47:23] Hamdanxd: even if it was amazing I don't think he would say LUL
[0:47:26] duckpinbowler: ohhh we had one in my hometown. it didn‚Äôt last
[0:47:29] yarados_: Yeah apparently McD coffee is better than Timmies now
[0:47:39] shadowymisstep: That's why it's better
[0:47:42] shadowymisstep: Now you know
[0:47:51] NoxParagon: McD Coffee is better than Panera and at times Starbucks
[0:47:54] yarados_: I knew about that but I don't drink coffee so I can't say
[0:47:55] NoxParagon: But never Dunkin
[0:47:58] duckpinbowler: Dunkin ran out Tim Hortons in my home state
[0:48:01] shadowymisstep: Okay lads what the fuck is Panera
[0:48:07] NoxParagon: Stl Bread Co
[0:48:08] shadowymisstep: I just know about its murder lemonade
[0:48:10] shadowymisstep: Hi Blaber

[0:48:30] rebeldarling: gonna queue some games myself so thanks for streaming! good luck this weekend, you got this. go c9 rebeld18LOVE1
[0:48:55] NoxParagon: Panera Bread is a bagel/bakery company
[0:48:58] duckpinbowler: Panera has sandwiches/soups/salads/baked goods but the soups are the best imo
[0:49:02] yarados_: C9 is kind of cheating for having Vulcan and Jojo
[0:49:08] NoxParagon: But the coffee is utter trash
[0:49:18] yarados_: Isn't that against competitive integrity rules
[0:49:19] shadowymisstep: So it's like a fast food meal place thing
[0:49:28] NoxParagon: Not fast food
[0:49:31] rfarleydude97: rfarleydude97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! LFG!!! Great game today, lets end this weekend on a strong note. #C9WIN
[0:49:51] duckpinbowler: you can sit down in it and the foods pretty fresh
[0:50:00] NoxParagon: but i would say a bigger einstein's
[0:50:01] duckpinbowler: it‚Äôs kind of like a cafe
[0:50:06] shadowymisstep: Okay so yeah. It's Tim's
[0:50:14] shadowymisstep: But with murder lemonade?
[0:51:03] duckpinbowler: I haven‚Äôt heard much about the lemonade recently so maybe?
[0:51:24] yarados_: Hoping one day there's a league event in Canada
[0:51:39] shadowymisstep: Canadian roadshow PLEASE bro I'm on my hands and knees
[0:51:40] rfarleydude97: LMAO
[0:52:00] duckpinbowler: I‚Äôd buy the plane tickets and update my passport for a Canada event
[0:52:20] Vampkenz: whos tornado is stronger
[0:52:26] shadowymisstep: Imagine the content of forcing all the Canadian players to pretend they know things about their country
[0:52:26] NoxParagon: Canada is lucky to have part of the world cup lol
[0:52:30] not__keith: malphite having a hard time
[0:52:37] duckpinbowler: I wanted to go to semis so bad because it was close to where I live but it sold out so fast
[0:52:44] swampertplaysstuff: oh when did they change janna q to show min distance
[0:52:48] yarados_: @NoxParagon who cares about the world cup all we need is hockey and esports
[0:52:52] jimmythechef: league of legends world cup would go crazy
[0:53:04] shadowymisstep: Canada's not winning the Cup this year I think lmao
[0:53:08] shadowymisstep: I mean, I hope we do but FUCK man
[0:53:17] yarados_: Canada hasn't won a Hockey cup since 93
[0:53:22] shadowymisstep: I knowwwwwwwwwwww
[0:53:25] shadowymisstep: T-t
[0:53:30] yarados_: Surely the leafs do it
[0:53:33] duckpinbowler: wait really?! I find that quite shocking
[0:53:40] shadowymisstep: HA right they need to win two rounds first
[0:53:43] shadowymisstep: Or even one
[0:53:50] yarados_: @duckpinbowler 80% of the players are Canadian
[0:53:51] GetInTheHotTub: HUH
[0:53:56] NoxParagon: Lol Canada and the stanely cup
[0:54:02] yarados_: just that Canadian teams aren't winning
[0:54:02] NoxParagon: two things that don't go together
[0:54:04] shadowymisstep: @yarados_ At like 60% now I think
