[0:07:15] MattScoot2: Cubby Kelsey and Inero
[0:07:19] MattScoot2: with the wrong scene
[0:07:20] kerokerogrips: why watch the live cast when vods and youtube co streamer recaps can skip the pauses and wont have the audio issues present today
[0:07:25] Vinnypotato: @travisgafford you collect one piece cards by chance?
[0:08:07] MattScoot2: How many prime subs went towards the kickstarter

[0:09:18] kerokerogrips: so frustrating to see IMT throw such a large lead
[0:09:38] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx

[0:11:30] mathias2k5: hi
[0:11:34] DavidSzajnuk: HOW BOUT THEM THIEVES BABY :)
[0:11:35] MattScoot2: yeah the audio was scuffed the entire time. even after the last match emily was echoing when they were breaking down the standings
[0:11:47] LateNiteArc: it was rough
[0:11:54] kerokerogrips: LCS IS BACK BABY
[0:11:56] LooterJoe: Did you do any interviews today?
[0:12:35] LateNiteArc: i completely forgot that it was a super week‚Ä¶ this schedule is so hard to track
[0:12:37] LooterJoe: Makes sense
[0:12:39] boebje123: If you get a chance you should check Dlifts VOD later, him spica and revenge were swapping war stories
[0:12:39] tiddies4: i dont think its a huge deal. Tbh blown out of proportion. People dont know how to enjoy anything anymore lol
[0:12:40] MattScoot2: No more 7 tiebreaker possibility
[0:12:43] kerokerogrips: alao i qas taken off guard that this week was a super week
[0:13:20] tiddies4: sound issues
[0:13:46] InfernaliteLoL: Its 2024 why do we have sound issues AT ALL
[0:14:07] tiddies4: Fair point
[0:14:17] LateNiteArc: broadcast today was worse than the worse ever HLL
[0:14:26] MattScoot2: Shoutout IMT with their highest placing season in forever, 7 or 8th
[0:14:31] boebje123: You can't give the viewer any  excuse to tune out and production issues are a big one at that
[0:14:41] tiddies4: LEC is still standing with ZERO producers and 20 on-air talent members lol
[0:14:46] dudeupstairs: lofi league
[0:14:46] LooterJoe: I'll be there for finals weekend
[0:14:53] MattScoot2: this might just be me but your mic is relatively quiet
[0:14:56] mucho_gras: it really losses credibility and comes off as unprofessional

[0:16:21] infinitejesticles: I love this song btw
[0:16:24] Wuju_Highland3r: hi Travis hope you‚Äôre doing well! <3
[0:16:31] LooterJoe: I love the games as well
[0:16:40] Turkleton3: I think it was mostly because before you kept facing away from the mic @travisgafford
[0:16:41] LooterJoe: Not so much magic
[0:16:42] misterbisco: Trailer looked awesome
[0:16:44] MattScoot2: What platform is the show on?
[0:16:47] 2Smug: What color/mixed color alignment do you think you are in mtg?
[0:16:49] infinitejesticles: I liked the games up to 76
[0:16:52] InfernaliteLoL: Fallout NV is legendary

[0:17:12] misterbisco: I like that they aren't trying to just retell one of the games
[0:17:20] Rawwkus: probably not unless I hear great things about it
[0:17:25] Todo88: April 1th
[0:17:26] boomskeeskee: Yes but after watching righteous gemstones I can't take Walter Goggons seriously
[0:17:27] Todo88: 12th
[0:17:39] Wuju_Highland3r: OOOH
[0:17:50] bii_bella: woohoho üëÄ
[0:17:55] infinitejesticles: thats so cool
[0:17:58] LooterJoe: That's so sick!
[0:18:04] MattScoot2: So i stopped watching prime because theyre charging 3$ for an ad free viewership
[0:18:10] Wuju_Highland3r: WTF that is so cool
[0:18:20] LooterJoe: New Vegas is the best

[0:19:00] b_taks: What‚Äôs up everyone!!
[0:19:26] MattScoot2: netflix hulu disney i think and prime now? im only watching crunchyroll nowadays
[0:19:26] Ian7j2: yoyo
[0:19:35] SteveWisey: OPEN EM!!
[0:19:35] mucho_gras: what can you pull out of thrse>
[0:19:41] Ian7j2: oh fallout magic? id get into that
[0:19:46] DavidSzajnuk: 100T easy gg
[0:19:49] bowenchung: Flyquest
[0:19:52] Ian7j2: 100T and C9
[0:19:53] CANAD1AN_0: Shopify with caedrel
[0:19:54] puffmuckl: dig and 100
[0:19:54] LooterJoe: 100T
[0:19:54] Wuju_Highland3r: Hmm Flyquest
[0:19:57] SteveWisey: 100T and Flyquest
[0:20:03] hungstepbro: top 3 C9 100T Fly. no order.
[0:20:06] tuRkytreaT: IMT
[0:20:08] simon_pls: definitely IMT
[0:20:15] simon_pls: IMT vs DIG for finals
[0:20:16] MattScoot2: FQ started their patented late game spiral. C9, 100t, TL, FQ, NRG, Dig
[0:20:21] boebje123: Fly looks a little boosted this ewek
[0:20:27] AristotleLumis: I am a C9  hater, so yeah, no C9
[0:20:34] timdiaz91: You can i get a gaffy ?
[0:20:35] LooterJoe: C9 has to play Shopify
[0:20:44] SteveWisey: I forgot the packaging on the Fallout packs have dirt and scratches on them
[0:20:45] Wuju_Highland3r: Flyquest seems a bit coinflippy at times but for sure 100T and Fly top 2
[0:20:47] bii_bella: I‚Äôll make my mind up come Sunday about fly
[0:20:47] DavidSzajnuk: tied with 100T and hold the 2-0 record, so only chance they drop 1 seed is realistically a loss to NRG tomorrow
[0:20:47] boebje123: It might actually be 100T and C9 in top spots
[0:20:48] CANAD1AN_0: shopify wins
[0:21:20] b_taks: Travis how was MC Chicago? I never got to ask about it
[0:21:23] SteveWisey: the lands are so good looking
[0:21:38] MattScoot2: If anyone wants to sub travis needs to fund his kickstarter pledge for the WoR leatherbound
[0:21:42] b_taks: Fair
[0:21:54] boebje123: Cheer500 stay warm during esports winter king
[0:22:11] MattScoot2: i went 650 for the numbered copy
[0:22:13] Todo88: Those books are sick
[0:22:15] simon_pls: i havent pledged yet, trying to decide what i can justify
[0:22:22] Rawwkus: C9 and 100T probably look the best right now but ill be interested in seeing how 100T looks in playoffs since some of their players are so inexperienced
[0:22:35] b_taks: Are you building anything new with the Fallout stuff or just upgrading what you already have?
[0:23:36] b_taks: Yooooo Ballista is hot
[0:23:57] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[0:24:03] SutaFox: I tried getting into MTG IRL took a pre-con to an LGS and had a miserable time Sadge guess ill stick to MTG Arena
[0:24:10] boebje123: I can see NRG sleeping their way to playoffs and then popping off
[0:24:36] DavidSzajnuk: nothing was said that's wrong
[0:24:59] DavidSzajnuk: just looking forward to BO5s
[0:25:09] MarkedJuice: Being a TL fan is a bad experience
[0:25:23] DavidSzajnuk: @MarkedJuice should be happy after today
[0:25:28] SteveWisey: @sutafox there is precon events this weekend at a lot of LGS stores for Fallout
[0:25:31] MarkedJuice: I am
[0:25:34] SutaFox: Yeah I was planning on going to magic con chicago but after that I passed on it
[0:25:41] MarkedJuice: 1 day of happiness
[0:25:57] boebje123: Who do you think will end up bottom 2 tho? I want to root for Shopify to make it out but they make it hard sometimes
[0:26:09] MattScoot2: is it just me or is travis dropping frames ? (i have 6 streams open rn so it might be me)
[0:26:11] Rawwkus: wouldn't have to worry about it as much if we had bo3 KappaHD
[0:26:16] snackgremlin: sleeve everything
[0:26:28] DavidSzajnuk: @boebje123 think it's just SR, too hard of a schedule for it to happen alongside the 0-2 against DIG
[0:26:30] DavidSzajnuk: they're in a bad spot
[0:26:33] DavidSzajnuk: even with the win
[0:26:50] MattScoot2: Flyquest finishes 3rd this split heard it here first.

[0:27:16] Ian7j2: i went to costream for DL
[0:27:26] bii_bella: oh god it was so bad
[0:27:27] boebje123: @DavidSzajnuk I can see a TL collapse saving SR from 7th but yeah it's looking rough
[0:27:28] bowenchung: how come u didn't go to the press box?
[0:27:37] boebje123: TL seems very hit or miss right now
[0:27:50] bowenchung: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[0:27:54] SteveWisey: $16 for that one on TCG
[0:28:04] MattScoot2: I predicted Yeon player of the Week this week. 1 game down
[0:28:19] DavidSzajnuk: only interviews that matter after this week are after the final day unless youre pumping them out now

[0:29:25] boebje123: Peter was talking on stream literally about the fact that nobody knows anything about the players these days
[0:29:29] DavidSzajnuk: have you thought about live-viewing instead?
[0:29:29] topraymond_: im curious do interviews of veterans or rookies do better?
[0:29:33] boebje123: Which is a shame because I feel like your interviews help this
[0:29:41] MattScoot2: @boebje123 thats cause they dont stream
[0:30:20] boebje123: broadcast is also trying to cutdown on turnover time aren't they? So less time for player or narritive segments I guess
[0:30:25] Milpoool: Quid might be MVP this split and I don't think I've seen a single piece of content with him or about him
[0:30:47] MattScoot2: there are very few players that consistently stream. its legit like only dhokla
[0:30:48] boebje123: Im not even sure if i know what Quid looks like LuL
[0:31:26] demondrinkingtea: Hey Travis do you still have that mtg card of mine?
[0:31:31] tiddies4: Soju can show his forhead for 4 hours and get 30K concurrent
[0:31:43] deeedeee25: im reading that book in the back, oathbringer
[0:31:59] boebje123: Pro's podcast right now is the main driver showcasing proplayer personallities right now I reckon
[0:32:04] demondrinkingtea: Summoners Rift from Canada
[0:32:43] demondrinkingtea: Yeah awesome you can send it back to me when you find it
[0:32:55] kud0slol: Travis when is fortnite gonna be back up
[0:32:58] MattScoot2: i hear bits of travis' soul breaking off every time he mentions that pro's is the best content out there rn
[0:33:09] boebje123: Team McDonalds is actually wild this season, so many players deserve a spot
[0:33:19] Rawwkus: my problem with the player volatility argument is that's it's a no win scenario.
[0:33:27] ur_a_rock: Hi chat and Travis!
[0:33:40] bii_bella: a fun lil story: I tried to get a classmate of mine into watching the LCS saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty entertaining right now I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth watching‚Äù and then right after the lcs went on that 2 week break LOL
[0:33:42] ur_a_rock: Just lurking
[0:34:02] kud0slol: 3 weeks break
[0:34:05] demondrinkingtea: Playoffs is always worth watching
[0:34:16] MattScoot2: im that weirdo that doesnt hate a break in the middle of the season but i dislike it in this particular season cause the season is so short
[0:34:19] WH_Turtle: TL gonna end 1st place yall watch
[0:34:28] ur_a_rock: What's the break between playoffs and end of regular season
[0:34:47] postmannnn: you did lead the hotline league guest into saying three weeks lol
[0:34:50] postmannnn: forget who that waa
[0:34:51] boebje123: tbf if your choice is between a mid season break and a long gap between MSI, this seems like the better option
[0:34:54] postmannnn: golden glue?
[0:34:58] bii_bella: is mark doing well?
[0:34:58] DavidSzajnuk: on Thursday too
[0:35:01] DavidSzajnuk: and people have no clue
[0:35:07] ur_a_rock: Really? I'm used to playoffs having a week break before it starts
[0:35:23] vez1: when I opened the stream today, 30k viewers + like 10k on youtube. Man that<s crazy low
[0:35:46] MattScoot2: They should have done an entire round robin in the cage, triple round robin but riot is pretending they dont have money
[0:35:46] ur_a_rock: I assume global insists on all leagues starting beat the same time
[0:35:49] ur_a_rock: Near*
[0:36:12] addonsforclearly: I literally missed lcs cause I had no idea it was happening
[0:36:20] vez1: yeahh I had no clue it was going on. True
[0:36:21] kud0slol: but the weekdays are better for viewership
[0:36:28] ChezBurglur: Just arrived, there's LCS today?
[0:36:33] MattScoot2: They have no idea how to train their audience to tune in. needs consistency lol
[0:36:41] boebje123: @ChezBurglur Was*
[0:36:55] ChezBurglur: Why is super week needed if there's such a big gap?
[0:37:07] MattScoot2: MattScoot2 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to travisgafford's community! They've gifted a total of 18 in the channel! 
[0:37:08] MattScoot2: MattScoot2 gifted a Tier 1 sub to mannylovesgaming! 
[0:37:19] demondrinkingtea: In the context of esports winter I think this season of LCS was really well done with what they had to work with
[0:37:25] boebje123: Whats the stack of boxes behind you?
[0:37:31] Rawwkus: I wonder how many people didn't know this week was a super week
[0:37:41] ChezBurglur: But theere was overlap anyway, so idgi
[0:37:55] kud0slol: do you have like every card in mtg by now
[0:38:12] ur_a_rock: Can't wait for the valorant community to exile us into the backrooms permanently
[0:38:26] MattScoot2: last time i gifted you got something good i think
[0:38:33] MattScoot2: lets keep the streak alive

[0:40:39] kud0slol: @mucho_gras cant be doing what
[0:40:58] demondrinkingtea: Love this wear tear printing
[0:41:06] demondrinkingtea: So pretty especially in foil
[0:41:10] mucho_gras: the level of standard has gone down
[0:41:25] kud0slol: oh i see
[0:42:10] demondrinkingtea: Did something happen on broadcast?
[0:42:31] boebje123: Are you deliberately scheduling double guests the last few weeks?  It might just be me but it seems like recently HLL episodes are having a lot of guests on
[0:42:36] Rawwkus: I don't they watch any League as much any more
[0:42:58] DirtyDogDaveTFT: I like it a lot
[0:43:06] boebje123: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Some guest I want to hear what they have to say
[0:43:14] boebje123: others have a nice repor and can build off eachother
[0:43:54] kud0slol: cranky old man inero
[0:44:23] boebje123: I was sad to hear Inero be uncertain if he'll be working in esports much longer
[0:44:30] boebje123: great personallity to have in the space, would suck to lose him
[0:44:34] imainleesin: why was the audio so cursed today?
[0:45:11] Rawwkus: did you room with Aaron Rodgers lol
[0:45:27] Rawwkus: FailFish
[0:45:29] SutaFox: Other Esports are actually doing phenomenal, the R6 event was HUGE in Brazil
[0:46:00] Chia_Ba: Did the @DavidSzajnuk quid MVP train already come through?
[0:46:12] DirtyDogDaveTFT: do you think that NA having a good result at MSI would have a significant positive impact on viewership?
[0:46:32] Autoriot: how was LCS today? missed it all while at work
[0:46:44] boebje123: Will you do any coverage for 2XKO when it comes out?
[0:46:59] LooterJoe: What would you do if you left esports?
[0:47:00] imainleesin: @Autoriot IMT cant make playoffs anymore
[0:47:16] DaAsianGuy: Will you cover valorant in the future?
[0:47:17] Autoriot: expected
[0:47:22] MattScoot2: if tgi had a bigger budget would you have somebody doing coverage for 2xko
[0:47:43] kud0slol: it would be cool if ppl start playing league again after 10 yrs of obscurity like ppl did with minecraft
[0:47:44] boebje123: Ever thought of starting a second channel for personal interests?
[0:48:05] SutaFox: LOR is also much more niche tho no?
[0:48:08] Tbonesteak77: did riot give up on their mmo feel like i havent heard about it in forever
[0:48:55] kud0slol: he did a video on that recently

[0:49:06] SutaFox: Its also 2XKO no 2KXO
[0:49:07] boebje123: I think Heartstone popped off because it was a perfect storm, LoR shot for what Hearstone was and by that scope massively underdelivered
[0:49:53] Rawwkus: btw, I didn't see the esports tab take over the client today
[0:49:55] imainleesin: Can we acknowledge that Doublelift didn't know what the Great Lakes were?
[0:50:09] boebje123: It is weird how TFT stuck around
[0:50:28] imainleesin: true LUL
[0:50:43] Ikancast: i had complained about LoR at release that their quest system gave you like 3 quests to do in a day. its boring. i want to be able to quest for hours when i do play and not do 1 a day
[0:50:45] SutaFox: TFT is just fun at its core
[0:50:50] boebje123: I mean the original dota mod and the standalone spin off seam way less popular

[0:50:53] MattScoot2: i also thing hearthstone fumbled the bag competetively
[0:50:58] MattScoot2: think*
[0:51:08] boebje123: TFT was a spring of the moment oppertunity that happens to be a big hit
[0:51:11] boebje123: funny how that goes
[0:51:49] Autoriot: @MattScoot2 all Blizzard games tried to do Esports too much, micro-transactions too much, and now are in ruins
[0:51:59] MattScoot2: but travis, nfts
[0:52:22] SutaFox: Yeah Unironically NFTs would work for an online TCG lmfao
[0:52:29] steppiess: traits are pretty intuitive/easy to understand, the decks basically build themselves and its very visually obvious what they do a lot of the time. runeterra was waaaay too complicated
[0:53:25] airman_baker: wanted to stop in for the traffic and say hi BUT HAVEN‚ÄôT WATCHED YET CUZ AT WORK SO BYEEEEE
[0:53:55] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[0:54:00] boebje123: I mean LoR is only a failure by Riots standards, if it was developed by a small studio it would have been considered a success
[0:55:02] SutaFox: I mean its what you said why pay for something you cant own
[0:55:04] matthew0zz: who are frontrunners for mvp travis
[0:55:21] iAmAWPERATOR: hot take time?
[0:55:59] blepss: have you pulled anything fancy yet
[0:56:05] kud0slol: they need to make remastered new vegas
[0:56:23] SutaFox: Hot take Riot doesnt need more international events, people already barely care about MSI
[0:56:32] MattScoot2: its quid
[0:56:33] LooterJoe: Quid or River
[0:56:36] MattScoot2: i dont think its that hard to say quid
[0:56:37] matthew0zz: quid has like double the POG's anyone else has
[0:56:46] MattScoot2: Quid has 6 pogs in 8 wins
[0:56:52] notbob123: Impact?
[0:57:03] matthew0zz: playing the best not the best
[0:57:08] steppiess: crazy how Quid went from boomerang import contention to MVP contention
[0:57:09] SutaFox: jojo still by a mile
[0:57:17] LooterJoe: Right now yes
[0:57:41] LooterJoe: Jojo has had like 3 pop off games maybe
[0:57:44] boebje123: @steppiess It's almost as if giving people a chance for longer than a split can pay off
[0:57:44] LateNiteArc: if Jojo looks as good as he did today for the rest of the weekend, I think he takes the lead
[0:57:44] Darkallyht: quid
[0:57:57] iAmAWPERATOR: okay here goes since im east coast and never awake for hotline...  TL coaches should be in jail at this point. theyve had so much turnover since DL with no real success. millions on imports or rookies always the same problems and awful drafting.. time to move  on from TOP level org coaches, no spawn but like DODO. always the same problems with the team. bad drafting, bad mid to late game its systemic at this point
[0:58:00] matthew0zz: yeah 6 POGs in 8 wins is alot
[0:58:05] SutaFox: Travis how do you feel about taking the 10th place out of the LCS but you cant take the IMT out of 10th place?
[0:58:07] postmannnn: no one on flyquest really stands out
[0:58:13] notbob123: Quid or Impact
[0:58:16] MattScoot2: Quid has 6 players of the games in their 8 wins. 100t has the worst early game by a mile but quid still shines.
[0:58:38] postmannnn: if C9 wins out into first place and he carries then maybe Jojo again
[0:58:41] SunnyDavidRS: IMT are probably better than their record suggests weirdly
[0:58:48] matthew0zz: IMT team is way better roster wise than their lasts ones for sure
[0:58:48] boebje123: Do you reckon they're still eligible to be booted from the league

[0:59:21] Rawwkus: üéµ when you try your best but don't succeed üéµ
[0:59:36] LooterJoe: Someone has to be last.
[0:59:43] steppiess: Bvoy would be my sleeper pick., hes putting up insane numbers for where his team is
[0:59:44] LooterJoe: I am fine with it being them
[0:59:50] boebje123: but it doesn't have t obe the same team every time LuL
[1:00:08] SutaFox: Okay hypothetical @travisgafford if IMT was bought out by say Sentinels or M80 and kept the same roster would they perform better with a new supporting org?
[1:00:15] iAmAWPERATOR: donowalled
[1:00:39] SutaFox: Thats so damning LMFAO
[1:00:56] boebje123: @iAmAWPERATOR Bro you wrote an essay haha
[1:01:03] matthew0zz: people want DSG in but no way they can
[1:01:39] DaniGrim: Random aside - I think the break killed the momentum from a viewer perspective for LCS. I was super excited, even though C9 was losing, and now I'm glad that C9 is winning but I sort of lost some of the intrest in this split.
[1:01:43] kud0slol: no doublelift no win
[1:01:56] steppiess: 3rd highest KDA, 2nd highest damage share,  2nd highest gold diff at 15 (behind turtle who had like 2 games) bvoy my goat <3
[1:01:59] MattScoot2: I think dodo has assembled some teams with no real identity
[1:02:00] matthew0zz: TL are missing a clear carry I feel
[1:02:01] Rawwkus: unironically, would a team McDonalds full of all current free agents beat IMT
[1:02:42] SutaFox: @Rawwkus BROTHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT Licorice, Santorin, Perkz, Stixxay and Treatz all being teamless LMFAO

[1:02:50] boebje123: Here's my dog shit take, I wish they'd boot Immortals and reinstate relegations. Have a big tournament like Valorants Ascention where the winners earn a spot
[1:02:53] MattScoot2: i dont know if that pans out in the numbers. they had higher viewership actually
[1:03:17] kud0slol: relegations are so fun
[1:03:18] yarados_: the break was damaging period
[1:03:29] matthew0zz: @SutaFox santorin retired treatz was legit last place again last year and perks played like shit in this split licorice is good tho
[1:03:34] LooterJoe: I know I am crazy for this opinion but I love watching the LCS so much I don't really care about what else goes on around it. I keep up and will be watching as long as it is on.
[1:03:35] mithrilblue: wait this is my friend‚Äôs song
[1:03:42] MattScoot2: The break was a failure from the orgs overall since htey did next to no content and they should be ashamed of themselves for that but thats a different thing
[1:03:46] iAmAWPERATOR: @travisgafford thoughts on a triple round robin. would kinda give us BO3 between teams by just adding another bo1
[1:03:54] prosciuttofist: hello!
[1:03:56] SutaFox: @matthew0zz And theyd still clap IMT in 16:47 KEKW
[1:04:03] steppiess: @MattScoot2 c9 streamed fan games throughout the break FeelsDankMan
[1:04:05] yarados_: @MattScoot2 It's not on the orgs fault that there was a 3 week break
[1:04:45] yarados_: also why did they say its a 2 week break when it was a 3 week break?
[1:04:52] yarados_: did the broadcast just wanna lie or?
[1:04:58] MattScoot2: Im a TL fan and the only content they put out on any platform was the last day of the break and it was a sub 2 minute short of people trying to insec training dummies
[1:05:05] SutaFox: I still think Friday Night League in a triple round robin was REALLY fun tho Sadge
[1:05:09] LooterJoe: I think it's crazy I still can't buy the new 100T jersey
[1:05:21] matthew0zz: add 2 more weeks take away the break
[1:05:23] DaniGrim: I happen to do product for a living, and I really hope that Riot isn't looking at WoW stats to be able to tell if something they did was positive or negative, because if they are that would be not the best approach, to put it lightly.
[1:05:23] yarados_: It should just be bo3s
[1:05:29] boebje123: Fearless BO2 low key sounds fire
[1:05:30] iAmAWPERATOR: you dont really they just took a 2 week break. put them in the cage and we basically end at the exact same time. i think lec and lpl still end before us
[1:05:40] yarados_: @iAmAWPERATOR 3 week break*
[1:05:41] iAmAWPERATOR: after*
[1:05:45] MattScoot2: @boebje123 nah theyd just handshake drafts. fearless bo3
[1:05:52] yarados_: and 1 week didn't count because we were shoved into a back room
[1:06:01] DaniGrim: (Only dropping creds for context of my opinion)
[1:06:18] Ikancast: because if you actually like watching the games then less is more sounds insane
[1:06:20] SutaFox: Okay one more hypothetical @travisgafford Out of every change made in the past 5 years you can change one to fix everything, what do you change
[1:06:49] Ikancast: i find more in different sports where there actually is more to watch
[1:06:57] yarados_: I think this is completely a Riot issue because Valorant formats are also dogshit
[1:07:02] mithrilblue: to be honest LCS could do Bo5 if broadcast can sell it in a super engaging way
[1:07:03] NA_Weasel: why are we copying builds and importing players from korea but refusing to play bo3?
[1:07:23] DaniGrim: to that - I think it isn't about # of games, but about the stakes feeling more tangible. Bo1 just feels so throwaway.
[1:07:25] mithrilblue: its all about the stories you tell
[1:07:38] steppiess: we still get dig immortals matches though, if the stinkers weren't so stinky I wouldn't mind more games
[1:07:55] LooterJoe: You watch the LCS but do you enjoy it?
[1:07:57] MattScoot2: Fearless Bo3. for me, i dont care about them pushing back on it, its far more interesting than sivir smolder senna smolder sivir zeri every game
[1:07:59] boebje123: What if we import all Korean teams and players and then go to bo3
[1:08:00] Ikancast: bo3 seems popular worldwide
[1:08:03] boebje123: and we host the league in Korea
[1:08:05] iAmAWPERATOR: i just think we still end 2-3 weeks before lpl and lec plus had a 2 week break we for sure have time for another round of b01
[1:08:37] SutaFox: Korean fans are also born into Esports by nature theres truly no comparison in the social norms of Esports
[1:08:40] NA_Weasel: well but it seems better no? we get a clear winner after each bo3
[1:08:52] yarados_: It also doesn't help how NA only has Flowers as the shoutcaster (Leti and Raffaa negatively impacts the LCS)
[1:08:53] NA_Weasel: i see ur point

[1:09:02] mithrilblue: more like VCT does this, why aren‚Äôt we doing it?
[1:09:12] yarados_: Bo1s aren't enjoyable
[1:09:26] LooterJoe: I don't care about LCK or any other league. I am an LCS fan period.
[1:09:32] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:09:46] boebje123: You know what I would much rather have than BO3s or shit like that?  A team I actually care about, I haven't had a team that was *my* team for a while
[1:09:49] yarados_: C9 vs Flyquest! hype! oh wait it's a 1 sided stop, now let's go watch IMT vs DIG next! it's a hype killer
[1:09:58] yarados_: No you don't have clear winners in bo1s
[1:10:00] boebje123: I watch all games but there's not a single team that Im personally invested in
[1:10:00] Ikancast: no
[1:10:10] yarados_: if thats your argument worlds can be bo1 and it's a clear winner
[1:10:12] yarados_: that is flawed
[1:10:13] steppiess: I don't really care about the actual DNA of the format I just want more good games and les bad games. I like the LEC format of dropping the worse teams earlier in the season and giving more games of the good teams
[1:10:22] LooterJoe: I love BO1
[1:10:28] iAmAWPERATOR: i like bo1s. i just hate that there are only a total of 16 games
[1:10:37] iAmAWPERATOR: 14 whatever it is
[1:10:47] Ikancast: 2 bo3s a day
[1:11:08] steppiess: cut out the random 3 week break and move to 3 day broadcasts
[1:11:09] DaniGrim: I tend to agree that the LEC format helps with having less Bo1s and less bad games in general
[1:11:10] yarados_: Bo2 is equally bad
[1:11:11] MattScoot2: Single round robin best of 3 fearless, 2 bo3 a day. until riot remembers that they have billions of dollars
[1:11:20] DaniGrim: Bo1 single RR for seeding and Bo3 til top 4
[1:11:23] LooterJoe: worlds is it's own thing
[1:11:35] yarados_: fuck no to fearless
[1:11:50] Ikancast: i assume its 3-4
[1:12:01] Rawwkus: my only concern with bo3 is how will they continue speeding up the draft like they are currently doing now
[1:12:09] yarados_: LEC should also have no bo1s
[1:12:30] boebje123: LEC is fire right now bro
[1:12:36] boebje123: I don't want bo3 in there
[1:12:57] DaniGrim: What don't you like about the LEC format ?
[1:13:02] LateNiteArc: if a day of BO3 is just IMT v Dig and TL vs ST, I‚Äôm not watching that day
[1:13:21] DaniGrim: So if it wasn't 3 splits, would it be better ?
[1:13:24] DaniGrim: 2 splits, similar format
[1:13:31] DaniGrim: for LCS that is
[1:13:37] MattScoot2: Wait i did
[1:13:48] iAmAWPERATOR: what i think is so weird is that riot does just have a universal league schedule worldwide. imagine NFL divisions all playing different game amounts. no logic
[1:13:48] Ikancast: the worst part about LEC is the 2 teams cut from the start
[1:13:48] boebje123: Because bo3 is a lie
[1:13:51] boebje123: don't believe
[1:13:54] DaniGrim: LEC made it work, so similar schedule but 2 splits instead of 3
[1:13:55] yarados_: Fearless draft is so dogshit
[1:14:00] LooterJoe: They don't really want it
[1:14:13] boebje123: I want fearless purely because it seems fun, it's not at alle most competitive
[1:14:15] MattScoot2: Yep.
[1:14:22] MattScoot2: Until riot remembers they have money*
[1:14:28] HursheyCrisp: that sounds awful
[1:14:44] LateNiteArc: I want single round ribbon bo1 into a huge Swiss bracket
[1:14:47] mithrilblue: Ok Travis. u win. keep everything the same. 14 Bo1s is the future.
[1:14:49] iAmAWPERATOR: ill die on the triple round robin bo1 hill

[1:15:04] MattScoot2: I think fearless is a far more fun format and you cant really do that in bo1
[1:15:18] steppiess: well each team plays each other twice even in a single round robin bo3 since its a minimum of 2 games per bo3 but you could fit a double round robin bo3 in 10 weeks with a single game on friday and 2 games on saturday and sunday
[1:15:18] yarados_: People skip days no matter the format when bad teams exist
[1:15:43] Deneseth: 2 BO3's Fri-Sat 1 BO3 on Sun
[1:15:47] yarados_: People skip watching LCK and LPL days too. the format doesn't matter when it comes to that
[1:15:47] DaniGrim: 8 teams -> Single RR Bo1 for seeding -> Single bracket Bo3 to establish top 4 -> Double elim Bo5s for top 4 -> Winner wins split
[1:15:52] iAmAWPERATOR: iAmAWPERATOR subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:15:57] LateNiteArc: single round robbin for placement (Bo1) and then once you get into the Swiss, you start getting Bo3 for elimination or promotion games
[1:16:04] mithrilblue: i mean do we want more games or not?
[1:16:09] Rawwkus: play 6 bo3 a week and give 2 of the teams a bye
[1:16:37] NateyBC: they did it like that for val last yr in NA i think
[1:16:42] MattScoot2: I think people ALWAYS complain when the meta gets severely stale when its shit like senna smolder bot every game. thats why i want fearless. give LCS its unique flair, theyre not going to be playing the same picks as everyone else. Every other region has had their own thing historically, let us have that
[1:16:45] endurantz: rip twitch capsules
[1:16:50] boebje123: People advocating for these long splits forget that we've had longer formats before and viewer burnout is very real
[1:16:54] Ikancast: id rather them cut back on production and go remote if it means we get more games
[1:17:11] prosciuttofist: ooo i haven't seen these yet
[1:17:22] LooterJoe: Having a bo1 season that leads into playoffs where you have bo5 is way better. It makes playoffs more hype
[1:17:29] Ikancast: they did it for years and its way cheaper
[1:17:31] yarados_: @boebje123 Thats disingenous because there were things sabotaging the format (overlapping with LEC and multiple streams)
[1:17:37] MattScoot2: We already have remote production :D
[1:17:41] bowenchung: Will you be attending any matches this weekend Travis?
[1:17:45] iAmAWPERATOR: WE dont want that OMEGALUL
[1:17:57] Ikancast: yeah the broadcast today was so good with all the audio issues
[1:18:21] boebje123: @yarados_ It's not disingenous man, if I know who's going to end up in 1st and who's making playoffs and who's not and there's still 2/3 weeks left then wtf am I watching for
[1:18:23] iAmAWPERATOR: you think audio and visual issues wont happen remotely @Ikancast ???
[1:18:34] Ikancast: @iAmAWPERATOR they will but id be for it for bo3
[1:18:40] Rawwkus: the only way I would want them to do remote is if all teams can go train in Kr for the entire year
[1:18:52] Ikancast: yes we want to watch a competitive format whatever that takes
[1:18:53] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[1:19:11] Ikancast: how much would they save not doing it in person?
[1:19:12] yarados_: @boebje123 It is disingenuous because they changed it in so many negative ways at the same time which made people think bo3 was the issue when it wasn't.
[1:19:22] yarados_: Bo3 doesn't mean online btw
[1:19:28] bowenchung: Enjoy your evening Travis and maybe I will catch you on Sunday at Riot Arena.
[1:19:34] LooterJoe: Bo3 is just a bad idea plain and simple.
[1:19:41] iAmAWPERATOR: i think bo3 only works if you do 2 rounds. id hate to have the only time TL plays c9 be just on an off day. have a quick 0-2 and then never see them again
[1:19:48] NA_Weasel: is playing remote even competitive? imagine u have ur first stage game at msi xD
[1:19:50] MattScoot2: give me a remote double round robin monday-friday for the first couple weeks  eliminate the two stinker teams and go straight to bo3s
[1:20:13] Ikancast: we had an msi with artificial ping to please china, i think it would be more competitive than that
[1:20:38] yarados_: @iAmAWPERATOR thats still more games against each other than they do right now if its a 3 game series
[1:20:41] aroshta: are these fallout cards part of any competitive formats
[1:20:42] Ikancast: if the defense of no bo3 is a lack of funding for LCS, then maybe thats what it takes
[1:20:42] yarados_: wheres the logic
[1:21:03] prosciuttofist: do you think the cards in this set are favoring a certain color?
[1:21:10] boebje123: People seem to forget that if you're in this chat that you're a very small very dedicated part of the fanbase and your opinions might vastly differ from the casual viewers
[1:21:13] iAmAWPERATOR: @yarados_ no a 2-0 is 2 games. right now its 2 games but at least on different days
[1:21:19] MattScoot2: bye travis
[1:21:31] yarados_: @iAmAWPERATOR bo3 1 time is still equal or more games against each other
[1:21:39] yarados_: do the math
[1:21:47] Ikancast: is LCS broke? then you have to play broke
[1:21:51] boebje123: Run Travis Run! Escape the BO3 madness
[1:22:05] iAmAWPERATOR: triple round b01 ftw im done arguing
[1:22:19] Ikancast: people also die on the hill against it
[1:22:24] MattScoot2: Introduce weekly fan bans
[1:22:29] Ikancast: tbf i think bo2 would be just as good
[1:22:42] yarados_: I think hating the idea of bo3 is the wrong hill to die on
[1:22:46] yarados_: thats just me though
[1:22:47] LooterJoe: These teams should be allowed to compete in tournaments outside of the LCS during off season. Thanks
[1:22:48] Ikancast: yeah just dont play
[1:22:50] Ikancast: that works
[1:22:52] yarados_: what we are doing now sucks ass
[1:22:53] boebje123: o7 till the next one champ
