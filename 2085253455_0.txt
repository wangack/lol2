[4:15:49] shacoshoc: would you try eclipse+blade of the ruined king just for 1 game please ?
[4:15:51] TrundleTop1: sion @dqrkniqk
[4:15:57] TrundleTop1: rav too strong lol @shacoshoc
[4:16:00] GIBISIYOK123: morning yall trundieYooo
[4:16:10] dqrkniqk: @TrundleTop1 sion gotta be worst top laner ever i feel bad i used to main sion
[4:16:12] stratossfak99: @shacoshoc if they build armor gg
[4:16:33] Territus: !jax
[4:16:33] Nightbot: when he es just run with w, ult his ult. DONT q HIS E ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
[4:16:37] dqrkniqk: every time i vs sion i think how can i use my insane lead to carry game because that champ is so easy to beat its unreal
[4:16:42] zenicul: are u better top laner than baus?
[4:16:46] stratossfak99: @shacoshoc also 0 waves
[4:16:53] Nightbot: if i missed ur question just repost i answer after game I PROMSIE ILL ANSWER just ping me
[4:16:59] dqrkniqk: @zenicul baus is probably the only good sion in the world
[4:17:11] Territus: baus is also challenger and he is not
[4:17:21] Territus: so who is the better player
[4:17:29] TrundleTop1: baus is very good
[4:17:37] thespongie: lets be real
[4:17:51] thespongie: baus mainly got chall for multiple season from abusing sions split
[4:17:51] stratossfak99: Vs sion Botrk cleaver titanic steraks visage?
[4:17:59] dqrkniqk: baus imo is one of the greatest players ever his macro is off the charts better than 95% of players
[4:18:01] Territus: what about this season
[4:18:10] TrundleTop1: rav botrk @stratossfak99
[4:18:12] livekal: so if youre fed and the only lane doing well, should you continue splitting even if youre team is getting crushed and losing all objectives
[4:18:19] Territus: @dqrkniqk if you are challenger that’s .01% of players
[4:18:19] NotASkiller: @thespongie and this guy's isn't abusing trundle top? LUL
[4:18:25] TrundleTop1: usually the most optimal strat @livekal
[4:18:44] Territus: better than 95% of players would be like emerald 3
[4:18:59] thespongie: @NotASkiller never said he wasnt LUL
[4:19:06] Territus: I think diamond 4 is 3% or something
[4:19:07] NotASkiller: xdd
[4:19:28] thespongie: but sions ult plus passive let him just run down towers by himself into a fat 1v5
[4:19:34] dqrkniqk: @Territus i meant 95% of high elo players
[4:19:35] NeverSleepbro: yo @TrundleTop1 whatsup king?
