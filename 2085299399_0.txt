[5:30:39] Xuga_: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[5:31:24] bladetrinity16: @REALDOBER soloq and pro play are entirely different cause of communication
[5:31:30] Tulavin: @stunt do u agree that riot have to nerf supports to make adc stronger ?
[5:31:41] uselesslamp2: How do I know if our team comp is good or bad to dodge?
[5:32:06] r3nt0n7: @uselesslamp2 if you have to ask that, don't dodge. anything can win in low elo
[5:32:14] b8sil: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[5:32:19] HypnosREM: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[5:32:25] everyman322: @Tulavin that makes zero sense. adc's feel weak because damage is so high so their consistent damage has low value
[5:32:38] Shivsterr: were you always a supp main?
[5:32:48] ledoz: @Shivsterr yhink he used to be a mid main
[5:33:07] dubkitteh: it's pretty much best jg wins now isn't it?
[5:33:17] uselesslamp2: @r3nt0n7 ok , let me rephrase it xd , how do I know what to pick to fit the team comp?
[5:33:18] everyman322: man adc's have been crying they were weak since I started playing this game over 10 years ago, probably longer
[5:33:19] peonsrage: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[5:33:19] Tulavin: @everyman322 yes but supports scales much faster than adc and thats makes adc weakest role rn
[5:33:23] TheCoffeeCurator: does that mean you play kat haha
[5:33:37] everyman322: @Tulavin LuL that's some copium you been smokin
[5:33:52] bladetrinity16: adc feels weak cause crit items are dogshit rn
[5:34:30] BaneBladeV: bla de
[5:34:34] bladetrinity16: bane bla
[5:34:34] brightdiscord: that is the eternal question
[5:34:41] bladetrinity16: people are playing adc top lane anyway
[5:34:44] srgbhn: yo stunt you work or full time streamer ?
[5:34:45] bladetrinity16: look at vayne quinn and smolder
[5:34:51] everyman322: adc players think adc is weak because everyone oneshots everyone so adc has no niche since they're supposed to be consistent damage
[5:34:51] Mijkami: any meta with dominant adc are miserable. history is there
[5:35:02] r3nt0n7: @uselesslamp2 hmm.. #1 is whatever you are really good at, i.e. one tricks etc. #2 is look at what your team wants to do - do you want hard engage, does your team poke, or do you have hypercaries that  need protecting?
[5:35:23] ChromaKhroma: i dont feel like its bad to have a strongest role in the game
[5:35:31] bladetrinity16: people also have a habit of complaining too much instead of just adjusting
[5:35:45] everyman322: @Mijkami burst meta is pretty miserable too though
[5:35:54] MissJenella: love stunt's way of thinking :3
[5:35:59] ledoz: do you dream maker and moonstone first as sera supp?
[5:36:04] REALDOBER: me 2
[5:36:10] TheCoffeeCurator: same
[5:36:10] REALDOBER: we think alot alike
[5:36:15] adaptoh: sorry I just tuned in, what topic are we on?
[5:36:25] bladetrinity16: @stunt what about giving a little more exp in duo lane to keep up a bit better?
[5:36:39] TheCoffeeCurator: fk no
[5:36:41] uselesslamp2: @r3nt0n7 that was useful, tyy
[5:36:50] teteus_: did a raid happen? we full house today, love to see it
[5:36:52] everyman322: exactly and why would you want a squishy adc to auto someone 20 times when you can just oneshot with an assassin
[5:37:07] BaneBladeV: they already curbed down dmg from items. but yeah bloodsong is still too good
[5:37:20] TheCoffeeCurator: @teteus_ ye viper raided lourlo and lourlo raided stunt
[5:37:36] r3nt0n7: @uselesslamp2 yeah np. Don't put 'perfect comp' above A what champs you're good at, B what champs you like, and C what playstyles you like and are good at.  Don't play nautilus if you prefer lux/morgana
[5:37:46] everyman322: @BaneBladeV and then buffed them again this season and added new broken items, and buffed tons of champions over and over
[5:38:02] Mijkami: @everyman322 are in a burst meta though ? dont think so
[5:38:09] Mijkami: are we
[5:38:23] BaneBladeV: @everyman322 stormsurge is very meh dmg now
[5:38:28] everyman322: @Mijkami maybe if you havent been playing longer than a few years
[5:38:48] Mijkami: tanks exists. glass cannons being obliterated in end game is fair
[5:39:35] everyman322: @BaneBladeV which just goes to show how valuable burst is that they had to nerf it so hard
[5:39:45] TheCoffeeCurator: ap burst isnt very good
[5:39:53] TheCoffeeCurator: its too expensive
[5:39:57] Mijkami: Talon mains enter the chat

[5:41:12] uselesslamp2: @r3nt0n7 yeah ,  I believe that's my issue , as I found lately a website that evaluates both team comps and gives a percentage win rate based on it , and it was kinda accurate, but I think I should stop focusing on this. Thanks a lot for helping <3
[5:41:12] brightdiscord: Oldge

[7:06:58] vogue_hommes: NODDERS
[7:07:09] TheRiehlmfDeal: @digicake_ theres still some toxic assholes on comms in val, but the amount of toxic people in league is 10x that bc they caan just type it
[7:07:14] ChromaKhroma: league voice works fine but everyone just uses discord now..
[7:07:19] dyleni: I don't think they would ever put voice chat

[9:03:20] TwitchTime89: that skin is creepy
[9:03:22] memost1: @voidmoons one thing I've learned about fixing sleep is to not do anything in bed besides sleeping. So if you are in bed watching the stream or youtube or doing anything else not related to sleep, you are basically teaching your body that the bed is for other things as well which makes it harder to sleep later when you do want to. Just a thought
[9:03:36] PactMaker: Love orianna in this fuckass bob
