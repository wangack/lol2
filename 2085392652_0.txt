[0:03:54] Joker__Napier: That you are not the best xerath
[0:03:54] BlueSNS: !zwag
[0:03:55] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[0:03:55] netflikx: yeah that is how english works in fact
[0:03:58] statics_2: youre better than zwag

[0:57:46] kuperco: after all that, your team still manages to give first blood classic
[0:57:49] avuloseunda: huh
