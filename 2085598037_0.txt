[0:22:48] Eliannoula: KEKW
[0:22:51] BipolarPongal: Yeah, but wait for Asmon's take on it KEKW
[0:23:07] BipolarPongal: Sounds like Blason raid leading
[0:24:05] Hozzar1: @scripe would you mind if they split the raid into half
[0:24:19] Hozzar1: Or splits the bosses like in tbc
[0:24:50] Hozzar1: I mean two 6 bosses raids
[0:25:08] xiangru0414: 1
[0:25:12] Hozzar1: 2
[0:25:25] tannerazm: 3
[0:25:28] Notrik1: I enjoyed the first tier of MOP
[0:25:53] Honkeymagoo: The point you made about the unexpected nature of the evoker spec is good. This game needs some chaos in balance.
[0:26:59] tannerazm: camera top right maybe to read?
[0:27:48] MaskieHuh: put cam ontop of asmon LUL
[0:28:20] BipolarPongal: PepeLaugh
[0:28:28] Charm_pit: no that is Asmongolds take :D
[0:28:58] Sh4kuri: have 2 Teams KEKW
[0:29:09] reily47: double the raids, double the splits Despairge
[0:29:29] tannerazm: You could just have one harder than the other, so you need gear from the first to be competent in the second.
[0:29:35] ewevix: clear the first to unlock the second one
[0:30:00] andromedarwow: make 2 echo gps, send 1 to kill maghderion
[0:31:30] thefrag_au: I wanna see them make something as hard as TOP but in wow. I think it would be awesome, but maybe RWF racers wouldn't agree
[0:31:54] MaskieHuh: i remember doin superbloom early on game was basically slideshow so surely a hard world boss should be doable
[0:32:47] reily47: would be cool if they put in experimental raids
[0:32:48] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[0:33:06] Honkeymagoo: I think part of the reason it worked in sod is that people care less about competition and a level playing field for all classes.
[0:35:15] ewevix: i feel this is the most important point
[0:35:35] BipolarPongal: Would the incremental buff system like in ICC would be a good fix?
[0:35:46] reily47: yeah, what would the point of gear if not to make it easier? unless you make gear matter in other areas
[0:36:07] ewevix: the soft nerf by gear
[0:36:12] MaskieHuh: the vantus rune take that the guy commented is giga based
[0:37:23] EppatTV: first reply
[0:37:47] ewevix: its fine tho, not every team should be able to kill the boss all the time, for them killing it barely in bis gear is still their highlight of the patch
[0:37:54] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Basically give people like a small vers % after killing a boss
[0:38:15] pel1: Wouldn't that make boosting easier?
[0:38:20] BipolarPongal: Yeah, makes sense for reclears. Seems like most guilds just extend after a certain point because no more upgrades
[0:38:28] tannerazm: We don't rekill because of this reason... fuck reprog of Tindral
[0:39:12] EppatTV: pve boosting literally doesn't matter lol
[0:39:13] reily47: boosters will always boost regardless of the difficulty imho.
[0:39:25] ewevix: true
[0:40:06] pel1: They shouldn't nerf bosses after world first kills so the game is actually hard and means something when you kill end game bosses
[0:40:35] swedishhousemafiaa: Hey Scripe
[0:40:38] swedishhousemafiaa: the tea master
[0:40:43] tvilk: gm mr scripe how are you doing
[0:41:21] ewevix: ye that was like that in bc, but you had only 1 difficulty per raid and no m+
[0:41:25] reily47: @pel1 that would be nice, but I am suspect of blizzard's ability to balance it and not just make the tier laughable for guilds like ECHO and liquid
[0:41:37] EppatTV: in his world to work you need m+ to not drop relevant gear tbh
[0:42:10] tvilk: Imagine you have to do 3 raids every week, and not just 1.. you're literally spending 3 times as much time raiding and we all know raiding sucks
[0:42:15] brandogzz: Why are blizzard so lazy , fated is so lazy from blizz they could easily make a smaller raid for the last patch
[0:42:19] elsnickito: @Scripe Hi, have you checked out the gw2 rwf?
[0:42:31] MaskieHuh: think it creates bigger time sink for more casual end game player id say  imagine needing to hunt myth bis from 3 different raids
[0:42:35] ewevix: @tvilk you dont do them all at the same time, you do them in sequence
[0:42:39] Ephixon: I think more people are into m+ so most would just be chasing loot
[0:42:39] Vtal: I think he means like vanilla tbc wotlk, like in wotlk you went in phase 1 EoE os3d naxx then P2 ulduar then toc you know
[0:42:49] swedishhousemafiaa: did u have tea today?
[0:42:51] Echo_Esports: Want to learn from the best? Visit echogg.ly/coaching/Scripe and pick the Echo player that suits your needs!
[0:42:58] tvilk: @Ephixon based chatter
[0:43:09] NabaniSaa: My only issue with coming late into an expansion is getting cucked cause my Raider IO isn't as high as people who play at the start.
[0:43:14] Dandinga: blink twice, if the new content is lit
[0:43:22] iluvatar54: SusgeClap
[0:44:24] brandogzz: why i am saying that, fated just seems like a lazy fix for the last patch
[0:44:26] pel1: arent you boored of the ilvl gearing as it is right now 500 ilvl trinket is just better than 450 even if the on use/stats effect is much worse or annoying to use
[0:44:52] tvilk: hell yeah
[0:44:53] ewevix: lol
[0:44:53] tvilk: based asmon
[0:44:56] Milanesa_De_Pollo: CAUGHT
[0:44:56] tvilk: fuck scripe
[0:44:58] EppatTV: here we go KEKW
[0:44:58] tvilk: that guy sucks
[0:45:06] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT
[0:45:06] reily47: KEKW
[0:45:12] brandogzz: asmon has alot of bad takes but this hes right with
[0:45:22] Dandinga: true and based
[0:45:24] BipolarPongal: These professionals, man smh
[0:45:28] tideffect: xD
[0:45:36] Vtal: And so it begins
[0:45:46] MaskieHuh: i do think mby old tier should be  slightly boosted for while until its basically guaranteed to get new 4pc i remeber it feeling shit being only player in raid playing with old 4pc
[0:45:51] ewevix: but you can also farm it
[0:45:55] tannerazm: top 1% fuck those guys lmao
[0:45:56] Sh4kuri: Legendary Bow Sylvanas
[0:45:57] brandogzz: The raids are designed for hardcore/mythic raiders
[0:45:59] tvilk: That Broodkeeper ring for Evokers xddcat
[0:46:02] janehomero: SCRIPE I just came back wats th strongest
[0:46:14] jayzukee: who the fck cares about advantages in fated raids? for real now thats delusional
[0:46:21] brandogzz: Remove LFR/normal and make mythic easier
[0:46:21] doomwh1sp3r: Oh man, glad to be alive for Scripes Beard arc
[0:46:50] reily47: but isn't super rare items that only top people get one of the best things to do in an MMO?
[0:46:59] janehomero: wow... ok asshole
[0:47:20] NabaniSaa: Remove Raider IO and you make the new player experience a million times better.
[0:47:45] EppatTV: @reily47 civilians would hate that so much
[0:47:46] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Kapp
[0:47:52] KASTAA: D:
[0:47:53] BipolarPongal: o7
[0:47:54] tvilk: BANNED
[0:47:56] Eliannoula: who?
[0:48:05] Gorthol217: i dont get why the first change people demand for mythic raiding is not lifting all these useless restrictions like the lockout and server restrictions i just wanna play the game and not look for a guild and commit to playing every week forever
[0:48:09] jayzukee: @NabaniSaa yes and longtime players experience worse
[0:48:11] doomwh1sp3r: ofc, Just bring back Titanforging, so LFR gamers can get Top items Kappa
[0:48:30] NabaniSaa: @jayzukee You play WoW, you did it to yourself
[0:48:31] Echo_Esports: Yooo i yoinked a Staforge PC. Best choice of my life . Go yoink yours at: echogg.ly/starforge/Scripe
[0:48:44] EppatTV: based
[0:48:45] BipolarPongal: As a casual I miss when these elitists farmed World Quests for corruptions xddcat
[0:48:57] jayzukee: @NabaniSaa not really, just stay in groups with equal experience and dont expect to get boosted
[0:48:57] Charm_pit: lfr shouldnt exist
[0:49:08] brandogzz: So whats your solutions , like me this season ive been killing hc fyrakk since 10.2 and still dont have augury trinket
[0:49:12] EppatTV: D:
[0:49:29] doomwh1sp3r: I had to do Ashvane on all difficulties + bonus rolls for Trinket for like 2 tiers :(
[0:49:32] NabaniSaa: @jayzukee I can't, don't have enough gold as a newer player to get carried. Maybe change the toxic end game gatekeeping?
[0:49:41] yujik46: just bring back dinars very ez
[0:49:51] pel1: better great vault instead of random choices just let teh player choose 1 item each week
[0:49:58] EppatTV: dinars pls
[0:49:58] doomwh1sp3r: @yujik46 Think Dinars will be a thing in S4
[0:50:00] Dandinga: pretty much after x kills you should be able to get what you want
[0:50:00] BipolarPongal: But gamba is fun
[0:50:08] yujik46: @doomwh1sp3r ye but they should be a thing every season
[0:50:11] brandogzz: Agreed
[0:50:29] jayzukee: @NabaniSaa im stopping the conversation here.. the gold and carry words in 1 sentence are crazy cringe if your a new player and instantly buy a boost
[0:50:39] doomwh1sp3r: Bonus rolls might be a decent middle ground between nothing and Dinars
[0:50:46] brandogzz: But blizzard keep giving you tier  items in your raid vault sloot in month 4 of the raid like bruv
[0:50:50] tannerazm: Echo doing anything for S4?
[0:51:08] tannerazm: Any IRL meetup persay
[0:51:10] MaskieHuh: imagine being able to use those socket tokens so you can go from lfr bis trinket to myth track with enough time
[0:51:19] stillsuitstk: stillsuitstk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! NotLikeThis
[0:51:20] StreamElements: stillsuitstk just subscribed for 7 months in a row PogChamp
[0:51:29] BipolarPongal: Just one more hit GAMBAADDICT
[0:51:35] jurashh: then suddenly there is that one guy who got 4 items in 2 bosses :D
[0:51:38] yujik46: dinars in s4 sl were literally perfect and then they just removed them for whatever reason
[0:51:42] Vtal: Rng crit haha
[0:51:51] doomwh1sp3r: Yeah, but additive RNG is better than waiting for another week for something to drop LUL  I'd still prefer Dinars tho
[0:52:05] brandogzz: Surely you think LFR is bad for the game
[0:52:22] Dontyxiv: LFR is a debuff
[0:52:22] doomwh1sp3r: LFR would be mostly to see the story
[0:52:23] Dellin: I wish we could have a trader that lets you exchange tokens for dungeon loot
[0:52:30] MaskieHuh: been forced to run normal belor because of shit rng
[0:52:40] ewevix: lfg is like tourist mode
[0:52:48] MaskieHuh: and thats with doin normal hc and myth raid
[0:52:49] Milanesa_De_Pollo: LFR parses YEP
[0:53:11] NabaniSaa: @jayzukee I just think you're avoiding the inherent gameplay issues that the game fosters and can't provide a good reason why the new player experience is trash, thanks for gatekeeping
[0:53:13] Vtal: I would assume they get into lfr cuz they dont have to interact with lfg and not get invited
[0:53:15] brandogzz: yes LFR should get removed
[0:53:22] Charm_pit: beard of knowledge
[0:53:58] Hozzar1: True

[0:54:53] doomwh1sp3r: If the ilvl didn't change, I'd have to force my guild to rekill M Raszageth LUL
[0:55:22] jurashh: would ujst remove 90% of what to do in the game of each season
[0:55:25] jurashh: how is that good
[0:55:45] doomwh1sp3r: pre-nerf M Rasz bow at like 430something was > than a 489 Bow
[0:56:30] andromedarwow: ff14 and lost ark has no gear farming for their mythic difficulty raiding. but i'm not sure if it is good for the game
[0:56:41] Cmde: i dont think too many players return to wow mid season wanting to play all the raids tho, doing 1 raid is a pain in the ass imagine having to look for a group to make 3 raids...
[0:56:44] Hozzar1: It's yn
[0:56:46] Dandinga: its your fault scripy Madge
[0:56:52] reily47: KEKYou
[0:56:55] LuiBMHunter: Scripe is responsible!
[0:56:56] Hozzar1: It's scripes fault
[0:57:09] stillsuitstk: I genuinely tried to return to wow, but DF is too expensive lol.
[0:57:10] Eskimo0_lol: I feel like in Nighthold we had a weapon that scaled infinitely, i could be wrong.
[0:57:14] kellarXO: Leaking logs POGGERS
[0:57:29] tannerazm: 486-488

[1:05:09] Thdlock: AP
[1:05:10] Echo_Esports: Save up to 35% and level up your stream with Elgato! Get started today : echogg.ly/elgato/Scripe
[1:05:11] Thdlock: and
[1:05:13] Thdlock: TITANFORGING
[1:05:15] tannerazm: MUTE HIM
[1:05:26] brandogzz: But the last two bosses have been designed for 2 guilds for the last two years now
[1:05:28] GameChampTCG: no PTR and the RWF becomes so insane imo
[1:05:30] BipolarPongal: BASED 󠀀
[1:05:32] Ftmjgtde: why does thd kinda make sense
[1:05:32] Cmde: @Thdlock azerite weekly farm!
[1:05:40] BipolarPongal: bring back corruptions and AP
[1:05:46] LuiBMHunter: scale bosses compared to ilvl of raid?
[1:06:10] doomwh1sp3r: Just passive increase gear stats by 1% per week, ez nerf
[1:06:31] Milanesa_De_Pollo: What if you had to farm Islands AND Torghast? Pog
[1:06:47] tankeern: YES FUCK THE RACE Kappa
[1:06:50] tankeern: 4Head
[1:06:52] kaverrr: Blizzard just need to cap gear for first 2-3 weeks somehow. Most players don't spam M+ anyway.
[1:07:00] BipolarPongal: Yeah, agree. Fuck Echo and Liquid
[1:07:02] Blaknwyt: Does THD have an AP Titanforging cult? somewhere in the hills of Alabama
[1:07:19] Thdlock: no come on
[1:07:21] Thdlock: dont use logic scripe
[1:07:22] tannerazm: That's like saying that worlds for LoL is ruining LoL
[1:07:25] Thdlock: ur an elitest rwf player
[1:07:27] RasnerG: That was it was the best
[1:07:31] Thdlock: its not like we just came out of one the easiest tiers
[1:07:31] Thdlock: aberrus
[1:07:52] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Yes Pog
[1:08:00] BipolarPongal: Wait for his PvP take PepeLaugh
[1:08:01] RasnerG: No body watches MDI
[1:08:06] RasnerG: Or PvP
[1:08:09] aftergl0w: Just burn it all Sadge
[1:08:48] doomwh1sp3r: Just implement Diablo Immortal thing. Join raid, autoplay, watch streams
[1:09:18] kaverrr: Personally I think farm raiding is horrible content. The only enjoyable part is the social aspect of being in a guild.
[1:09:20] frexzl: Asmon doesnt even play WoW anymore, why does he care
[1:09:27] not_that_guy: @Thdlock what did liquid offer to Tobo monkaHmm
[1:09:30] brandogzz: Hes not saying the race is a bad thing, hes saying the raids are played around the hardcore guilds
[1:09:31] GameChampTCG: asmongold sounds so dated when he is talking about wow. he doesnt even play wow anymore. and the skill level of players is so much higher than it was when he played wow as his main game. the game needs to evolve with the player base
[1:09:37] tankeern: they started there key depletion journey after watching you, makes perfect sense actually YEP
[1:09:42] doomwh1sp3r: Ye that's why I get spam "Just started playing, I wanna join a CE guild" applications in my guild
[1:09:44] doomwh1sp3r: madge
[1:10:08] Kemskemss: I’m usually okay with Asmon takes, but right now I hate every fucking word he says
[1:10:22] Cmde: if rwf takes only a couple days they could even loose that free marketing, cuz if guilds cannot make profit out of it they wont do it
[1:10:28] s_t_o_r_m__: Bosses tuned hard is good for top tier raiders just nerf after a month all good.
[1:10:30] GameChampTCG: jailer was diff because they essentially put 2 raids into 1 because of covid
[1:10:41] jayzukee: he is talking about jailer, a boss that was never supposed to be tuned like that, it was an exception
[1:10:50] Echo_Esports: Grab your fantastic new Displates for up to 33% off! Use echogg.ly/displate/Scripe and enter code: ECHO
[1:11:06] doomwh1sp3r: Both SL and DF were supposed  to have at least 1 more raid tier
[1:11:11] brandogzz: @jayzukee so you saying mythic tindral/fyrakk was well tuned??
[1:11:22] BipolarPongal: Sounds like he didn't get invited to some WoW event and is mad
[1:11:31] GameChampTCG: but also jailer from a viewer perspective was amazing. that was my fav raid because it was long and it felt grindy. bosses didnt just fall over
[1:11:31] keli_q: He is not even playing the game
[1:11:32] jayzukee: you cant compare them to jailer it was much easier
[1:11:52] BipolarPongal: CAUGHT
[1:11:53] brandogzz: Tindral is so busted hes still getting nerfed 3 months later
[1:11:53] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Why you do this Scripe Madge
[1:11:55] tankeern: 4Head
[1:11:57] maplelost: TRUU
[1:11:59] noirlol: alphaW
[1:12:00] Hozzar1: True
[1:12:04] kaverrr: CAUGHT. Scripe is the evil mastermind
[1:12:05] ewevix: every single way
[1:12:08] andromedarwow: how dare u to ruin the game
[1:12:09] sinclsw23: what a horrendously bad take
[1:12:10] noirlol: KEKL KEKL KEKL
[1:12:13] BipolarPongal: KEKW
[1:12:15] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Stop ruining game Scripe Madge
[1:12:18] jayzukee: @brandogzz if you still think tindral is hard atm then you should stay in heroic mate
[1:12:19] Thdlock: well look
[1:12:22] maplelost: echo ruining  wow
[1:12:22] Thdlock: when u make an event
[1:12:22] doomwh1sp3r: Oh no, Mythic bosses being hard ruined the game. Casuals can't kill Tindral Week 4
[1:12:22] tankeern: no raiding have destroyed pvp Kappa
[1:12:25] Hozzar1: Scripe is ruining everything
[1:12:27] Thdlock: and it doesnt turn out well for u
[1:12:29] Thdlock: and u stop doing the event
[1:12:31] Baalroq: Still a sponsor though LUL
[1:12:31] BipolarPongal: Echo and Liquid ruined PvP and PvE BASED
[1:12:31] Thdlock: u want it to fail
[1:12:33] BlindOwlInTree: he is becoming grumpy old man yelling at sky
[1:12:33] Thdlock: xdd
[1:12:36] aftergl0w: What have you done D:
[1:12:38] frexzl: the RWF personally knocked on my door and kicked me in the balls aswell. unlucky
[1:12:43] reily47: local guild echo ruins everything
[1:12:43] Kemskemss: I blame you Scripe for ruining everything. Including my life Madge
[1:12:46] BipolarPongal: xddcat
[1:12:52] Thdlock: YEP
[1:12:54] troxleer: xddcat
[1:13:02] brandogzz: @jayzukee Thats the issue ppl like you, not like tindral got 20 nerfs and you saying its well tuned
[1:13:07] Disfacts: i think games just inherently become more difficult over time as people get better same with fortnite
[1:13:11] noirlol: asmongold NPX
[1:13:16] BipolarPongal: This Scripe and Max ruining my experience Madgeclap
[1:13:26] doomwh1sp3r: I mean he suggested separate RWF realms. Even if that happens there'd still be RWF on regular realms
[1:13:31] s_t_o_r_m__: RWF should be hard otherwise what's the point for top tier raiders?
[1:13:32] Dellin: people will always min and maximize
[1:13:32] noirlol: NPC take and his Chat trueing KEKW
[1:13:32] Numtrers: I wouldn't play wow if not for the competitive aspect, that's what drives me really
[1:13:33] Hozzar1: Scripe ruined pvp, ruined pve, he ruined my life, he ruined my dogs life
[1:13:35] maplelost: he wants gachapon games where u win by swiping harder
[1:13:36] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Scripe
[1:13:46] BipolarPongal: @Hozzar1 Not the dog too D:
[1:13:47] kaverrr: Tbh there's a degree to everything
[1:13:55] Aketzali: In BFA, we only had to do 1 max level m+ dungeon for the great vault. In Shadowlands it was 10. People did not have time to be social in Shadowlands.
[1:14:06] Disfacts: tetris is super minmaxxed
[1:14:10] wishfulalex: scripe kicked my dog WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:14:10] Santaceso: minesweeper
[1:14:13] Kemskemss: Asmon kinda forget competitve WoW wasn’t forced my Blizz. It’s a thing players were leaning to. Players went for RWF back then. And ofc Blizz reacted accordingly
[1:14:23] Baalroq: I love watching the RWF but I wouldn’t raid the first round
[1:14:25] Hozzar1: Dog pulled a muscle, he's OK now
[1:14:25] BipolarPongal: Tetris has more buttons to press than WoW Shruge
[1:14:29] RasnerG: The thing is everyone can participate on wow You can't
[1:14:47] Hozzar1: He went to the vets
[1:14:47] stillsuitstk: problem with classic has very bad players, literal elderly dads, you need to filter them sayuwuDed
[1:14:55] LuiBMHunter: gasp!
[1:14:56] noirlol: he does not play the game and is insanly out of touch, worst dumb takes ever, fun video NotLikeThis
[1:14:59] RasnerG: Nee playera can't Even try mithyc raid due to them being new
[1:15:02] doomwh1sp3r: RWF Classic ToC took like 20 minutes or something
