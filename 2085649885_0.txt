[0:33:07] xcalebur: its flakked
[0:33:07] ascuane: no

[0:36:34] DragonnIsKing: does any ADC outscale smolder?
[0:37:00] nalf: think its gg goat
[0:37:04] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[0:37:04] ascuane: @DragonnIsKing i dont think any champ outscales smolder
[0:37:18] Choc_xD: asol could outscale smolder
[0:37:28] Choc_xD: but thats no adc
[0:37:29] defc0m: asol actually can
[0:37:35] nalf: ok your team is the best in the world maybe
[0:38:21] xrecurve: Range can outscale smolder --> Cait, varus
[0:38:36] xrecurve: senna
[0:38:52] el_danixd: @xrecurve nah its the opposite, cait and varus destroy him early and end or he outscales them
[0:38:54] ascuane: smolder completely demolishes them lol
[0:38:57] grimlnd: yoooo i enjoy ur videos alot ty
[0:39:09] grimlnd: can i ask what headset u have?
[0:39:13] DragonnIsKing: @xrecurve yea i tried cait vs smolder and it felt decent
[0:40:03] el_danixd: weakest bruiser in s14
[0:40:07] gulle1337: why black clever over ldr?
[0:40:09] ascuane: basically old zeri
[0:40:11] ascuane: LUL
[0:40:14] imbastreamer1: okay i think you Need antiheal beast
[0:40:15] xrecurve: @el_danixd i dont think you get that outscaled, because smolder cant hit you
[0:40:20] iambigrex: RIOT
[0:40:38] xrecurve: but obviously still lose if enemy team engages well
[0:40:41] el_danixd: @xrecurve ur forgetting that lategame league is not a 1v1, cait can't really hit either. and smolder wins in front to back hard
[0:40:44] OniricoTV: is thqt flakked?

[2:21:30] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: gpu is gtx 1050 ti
[2:21:31] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: how old is that
[2:21:37] ddaanbot: like 8 years ago cuh

[2:21:43] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @Dwippah 3200 MHZ
[2:21:51] ddaanbot: @FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW DDR3 or DDR4
[2:21:59] plsnoadc: 1050ti is still alrightish
[2:22:01] plsnoadc: for league anyway
[2:22:06] paomon: are your settings on low you shouldnt have these big rops
[2:22:11] realraccoonhours: league uses cpu mainly no? so just upgrade cpu if needed
[2:22:12] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: @paomon yeah ofc
[2:22:23] plsnoadc: yea I think cpu is the biggest bottleneck here
[2:22:24] paomon: u on ssd?
[2:22:34] ddaanbot: u can check which motherboard you have and which cpu socket it uses, then look for cpus that fit into it
[2:22:40] Dwippah: tbh I've got a ryzen 5 1600x and mine runes better than his game, despite the fact his cpu should be stronger
[2:22:56] FNC_AIRPORT_RUN_KEKW: im not gonna lie idk what u guys are talking about i have 0 idea about computers
[2:23:00] Dwippah: I do have an 1080 tho
[2:23:44] paomon: i had steady 144fps with a 4460 + rx 570 + 8gb ddr3 so shitty components you should be doing better than me

[2:36:10] plsnoadc: I think jinx might be pretty decent again with crit buffs
[2:36:13] Aisarrow: there are many items that give you crit chance  they made this in season 10 so its easy to be 100%  they might nerf the percentage of chance and the items ad stats  after crit buffs
[2:36:21] tomipacy37: @plsnoadc ye maybe
[2:36:36] plsnoadc: especially if the early dominant lethality adcs start disappearing
