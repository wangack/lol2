[0:30:24] Maantra: buy a personal coach for 20 bucks
[0:30:26] Maantra: best advice
[0:30:26] considerthechainrule: i feel like I usually end lane ahead or neutral, but cant carry afterwords. I know aatrox is supposed to be a teamfight champ but my team fights without any obj up and our waves get fuecked
[0:30:31] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil

[0:30:45] considerthechainrule: so ive been trying to fix waves instead of take useless teamfights, but should I just fight anyway?
[0:30:54] i_am_him_frfr: @considerthechainrule bro no one farms in iron just farm an d u will be rich as fck
[0:30:55] considerthechainrule: i really want to get better :/
[0:30:58] playerx87: CAN coup be good with this playstyle? I mean it is all about burst
[0:31:01] oops_i_forgot_my_username: @considerthechainrule dont even bother thinking of fancy words or terms like neutral. just join the game from a PC with an internet connection

[0:31:46] i_am_him_frfr: @considerthechainrule bro just keep at least 8 cs per min and dont die that much and u still rank up
[0:31:47] sladedari: @considerthechainrule play every game thinking and dont autopilot, play for the highest CS possible and focus on yourself, go for towers every game and you will get better
[0:31:48] Trevichko11: @considerthechainrule I guess learn how to cs better and watch any top lane main who explains what he does. Play an easy champion on which u cant mess up. Daveyx3, Alois(not on riven), Rangersz
[0:31:51] skeletaa: lowest rank in tft?
[0:32:01] casdy8: Aatrox's Qs needed true damage (divided from 25% dmg dealt imo)
[0:32:01] considerthechainrule: @eisalt123 people say stuff like this, an di play my heart out, but we only win when my whole team goes crazy ahead
[0:32:09] hesliterallyme24: @considerthechainrule play 1 champion preferably in a solo lane and watch a streamer play that champion when ur not playing the game urself
[0:32:20] pidgeon35: XD

[0:33:34] topgap2003: 7%
[0:33:34] hesliterallyme24: @considerthechainrule too hard for u, go play something like trynda or garen and whenever u lose lane, go on youtube and type garen vs X and see how others play it
[0:33:36] SEWl: @Naayil how to deal with babysit when playing aatrox?
[0:33:36] Spl1ff91: Half the iron players seem like they in this chat

[0:34:04] Trevichko11: @sladedari dont get me worng. He is awesome on Riven. But playing Riven in iron is not worth it. + Many players in iron are there bc thay have bad pc/internet
[0:34:06] killitsh: iron 4 is like challenger

[0:35:31] casdy8: Don't attack or stereotype whether they're in piss low ranks or anything.
[0:35:34] skeletaa: look for euw ranks
[0:35:36] jyxc7: @considerthechainrule no point in trying to communicate with the ai, just play the game
[0:35:40] considerthechainrule: like when I started I placed bronze 1 and the difference in terms of mental is night and day between B1 and I4
[0:35:46] baddecisiondanx: @considerthechainrule there is not an Elo without toxic crazies lol
[0:35:52] considerthechainrule: @jyxc7 fair enough

[0:36:07] oops_i_forgot_my_username: The system is mostly working yeah
[0:36:08] playerx87: Naayil, what about coupe de grace instead of last stand? Can't it be better with lethality playstyle and profane active?
[0:36:11] killitsh: take in account that a lot of that % is botted accounts demoted by ppl on purpose cuz they sell a lot
[0:36:21] kamazdestroyer: why there are less players in d1 than in masters?
[0:36:21] Trevichko11: @considerthechainrule Bro trust me. Players are the same in terms of toxicness all the way from ion to GM
[0:36:22] pidgeon35: its same
[0:36:24] SmilingAnimal: Season 8 diamond 4 is equivalent to masters now. It's so inflated
[0:36:24] pidgeon35: both shit af
[0:36:25] roamgoksel: mechanics
[0:36:25] casdy8: Play the game in your own pace, if you're not having fun in ranked. It's normal
[0:36:26] Holymanster: Skill

[0:36:34] oops_i_forgot_my_username: Most of the difference rn can be compensated by playing enough games.
[0:36:34] considerthechainrule: @jyxc7 should i switch to a split push champo then? cuz I hear (and feel) aatrox is a teamfight champ, cuz I struggle to hardshove lanes and take towers midgame. But trying to teamfight with irons is so coinflippy
[0:36:35] baddecisiondanx: between bronze and plate literally no difference except wave management

[0:38:14] playerx87: Naayil, what about coupe de grace instead of last stand? Can't it be better with lethality playstyle and profane active?
[0:38:18] baddecisiondanx: @naayil but you only go lethality here because you have voli, correct??
[0:38:24] skeletaa: @AATROXING_BBC anyways, who cares what riot says, you better than 60% of the server

[0:38:47] OskarG88: bro is smurfing with this build
[0:38:49] considerthechainrule: @Trevichko11 yeah ive been watching tons of stuff, mostly alois. I can usually win lane off of the first couple waves, but then carrying midgame just doesnt work

[0:39:13] Trevichko11: @considerthechainrule what champ do u paly?
[0:39:20] riotsbalanceteam: Is it possible to do a mix of both builds on aatrox ?
[0:39:38] pidgeon35: ye
[0:39:39] Zenko50: change ur profile medals to gm ones so it matches the theme
[0:39:42] baddecisiondanx: but if you don’t have a tank/bruiser jungle in that game, you’re not going lethality in that game, no?
[0:39:44] TheRealOGZairux: I KEPT TELLING THEM DAD
[0:39:57] oops_i_forgot_my_username: the 9 flat armor pen on sudden impact just makes me want to get it on every single champ with a dash
[0:40:02] kimmis25: @Naayil  will the insta hit aatrox passive ever happen?
[0:40:07] yavuzsultan_selim: yooo have a good stream
[0:40:08] Trevichko11: how much LP for chall
[0:40:09] Zenko50: "a gwardrinker"
[0:40:10] playerx87: What do you think about ADC item buffs? I think infinity edge 50% crit damage is a bit too much
[0:40:24] NatterMel: @Naayil when do you decide on which to play?
[0:40:27] drugerson: sterak is allowed? in the lethality build
[0:40:36] AATROXING_BBC: i mix the lethality build with sunderd sky first items its good
[0:40:44] pidgeon35: @drugerson its not

[0:41:40] oops_i_forgot_my_username: its good yes its not as broken as it looks
[0:41:52] baddecisiondanx: @aatroxing_bbc yes it trash

[0:51:19] LizlKun: @i_i_sofia_i_i did u watch his guide ?
[0:51:22] Yaazderler: or its just aatrox was him
[0:51:24] haad91: Jayce unironically requires more skill and piloting than other range toplaners
[0:51:25] shinsora_: not his abilities but his design and voice line is cool
[0:51:29] hasan7v7: aatrox is the better darkin
[0:51:29] Bnadryl: Rhaast is aatrox with training wheels
[0:51:34] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[0:51:41] Tyrone_Adams: is it just my stupid brain or does the E on Aatrox increase the aa range? @Naayil
[0:51:42] tretorhate: What about blue?
[0:51:45] xlad19: but rhaast has areal w
[0:51:46] Jadrix: just cause they both heal and have a knockup?

[0:51:55] rikym4rky: i mean, lore accurate?
[0:51:56] gunwsp: I wonder what the tree darkin will be like in game if they add it
[0:51:57] i_i_sofia_i_i: @LizlKun Yes! The only part about magic resist items he talked about is he builds hexdrinker when he needs it to survive the lane
[0:51:58] NIC_X99: For you what champ is considered to be hard to play?
[0:52:11] hasan7v7: true rhaast does have a W unlike aatrox 😂
[0:52:15] i_i_sofia_i_i: But I don't remember him mentioning when he does spirit or chooses rokern over hexdrinker
[0:52:23] casdy8: Even in Aatrox's voice lines, he judged him using a scythe in battle.
[0:52:24] yaranaika6969: exactly

[0:56:58] medon213: Wtf happened to arena gamemode i thought they were going to make it permanent
[0:57:02] playerx87: @jester86  I like Rhaast's chaos

[0:57:11] LessFluff: @medon213 They make it 16 players 2v2 thats why

[0:59:20] azpis92: is volibear top fair vs aatrox ?
[0:59:22] wachalkwach: xD
[0:59:22] casdy8: His current W is pointless 😭
[0:59:30] i_i_sofia_i_i: I can't wait to go to my plat elo to play against real toplaners
[0:59:32] DarkfiresT: yep
[0:59:34] hasan7v7: @playerx87 oh he played him on stream? That would be funny to watch lol
[0:59:38] yaranaika6969: XD
[0:59:40] medon213: What are good jayce counters?
[0:59:41] EXxnightingale: did riot say anything about aatrox W ?
[0:59:42] LessFluff: jayce is fine just play gragas into him COPIUM Kappa
[0:59:49] Holymanster: he 100% needed those buffs kek
[0:59:59] casdy8: @medon213 garen for one lmao
[1:00:01] yaranaika6969: as a ww top main i agree
[1:00:02] playerx87: @hasan7v7  he has played it in YT videos as well I believe
[1:00:02] dardo_03: hiboss
[1:00:06] sasraxe: @Naayil is winrate a good statistic to look into to know if a champion is good or no ?
[1:00:25] i_i_sofia_i_i: Aatrox lvl 1-4 is complete shit , Jayce early game is 10 times more broken
[1:00:28] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[1:00:29] haad91: Jayce unironically requires more skill than all the other range toplaners wdym
[1:00:39] sasraxe: alright
[1:00:48] jester86: except champ like APEfelious
[1:00:53] Zalek: jayce is weak
[1:00:56] Zalek: Kappa
[1:00:59] lance_fps: Jayce has a good laning phase, just the ganks make it hard imo
[1:00:59] i_i_sofia_i_i: @haad91 That is saying a lot about other range toplaners
[1:00:59] yaranaika6969: @haad91 againts melee's not really
[1:01:01] LessFluff: maokai KEKW
[1:01:14] i_am_him_frfr: Riot clueless about champ changes i am ezreal main and tell u that @Naayil
[1:01:14] hesliterallyme24: remember guys akali and ryze had 46% wr when they were at their most broken
[1:01:17] playerx87: Popularity also matters. Yone sits at 48 but is strong
[1:01:28] Zalek: i like jayce more than gragas tbh
[1:01:30] Holymanster: You mean like Maokai for 3patches in support role 53%+ winrate
[1:01:33] c3p0demadeira: ksante shit wr yet broken
[1:01:37] DarkfiresT: look that w escape
[1:01:37] LessFluff: how does jayce require more skill than something like gnar
[1:01:38] i_i_sofia_i_i: Harder then other ranged toplaners sure, but that doesn't mean the champion is hard
[1:01:40] haad91: I've seen you beating lots of Jayce solo that's because they couldn't pilot the champ well
[1:01:42] drugerson: bruh
[1:01:46] medon213: That movement speed is disguisting
[1:01:48] EXxnightingale: i think most league player forgot what diffcult means xdd
[1:01:49] atomicjumpsamurai: do you think the champs that are broken in higher elos are like that because no one plays their counters which usually are champs played in lower elos?
[1:01:52] Q_Flash2: @playerx87 how does yone have 48% wtf
[1:02:09] medon213: Crazy that he gets to knock you away and get extra ms on top
[1:02:11] eisalt123: jayce is so overtuned
[1:02:11] DarkfiresT: aatrox w is so bad
[1:02:26] i_am_him_frfr: item changes and haste changes and serylda and sht fcked up my boy ezreal
[1:02:38] playerx87: @q_flash2  haven't seen his wr in a bit, but he was like 48-49bmost of the time in S12 and 13
[1:02:48] yaranaika6969: i have mental block againts darius for some reason
[1:02:51] wachalkwach: is gnar playable ?
[1:03:04] lolKrow: arent u just describing ranged toplane picks?
[1:03:26] c3p0demadeira: jayce scales much better than aatrox no >

[1:03:50] Brock0Lee69: Good luck on that
[1:03:52] medon213: But i dont get why riot lets ranged top be meta when historically its been bruiser vs bruiser/tank role
[1:03:56] tailedbeasttr: hallo schätzlein
[1:04:18] EXxnightingale: so lethality is better from behind
[1:04:21] voyager269: nope jayce is tankier
[1:04:22] lordpe1: Hello
[1:04:38] DarkfiresT: 1 basic
[1:04:40] medon213: Champs like varus and vayne shouldnt be allowed top especially with barrier and ghost

[1:05:26] thestarforgerotp: @Q_Flash2 whats that?
[1:05:27] c3p0demadeira: how tf does this jayce have 1 item advantage
[1:05:38] EXxnightingale: @Q_Flash2 play to improve not to win
[1:06:06] c3p0demadeira: @Q_Flash2 limit how much you play
[1:06:06] haad91: @c3p0demadeira Took first tower, has 4 kills ig
[1:06:19] topgap2003: @lordpe1 XD what even scale with ap ?
[1:06:21] casdy8: Anything man... ANYTHING to replace Aatrox's W. Maybe bring back his one of his own skill where you can change between stances (1 stance that makes him deal more damage but cost a portion of health, and another gives you more healing smth like that)
[1:06:25] c3p0demadeira: @haad91 makes sense

[2:31:43] Ogolikus1982: @KSynical those were at least designed for toplane and you can play against them, tf is just subhuman
[2:31:45] aliensliker: @matoG4 ah, ppl dont even play the game, right
[2:31:55] mehdi_1247: 2s stun with 0 cd

[2:32:52] armaanxakx: Who said astrox is ranged?
[2:33:05] matoG4: @aliensliker you can be rank 1 you will always find people backseating in twitch chat
[2:33:09] kronozapien: why the fuck is he so fast?
[2:33:12] Friaon: just throw your sword at him
[2:33:14] drugerson: 625 q1 vs 900 point click mage ability
[2:33:21] as4noob39: @kronozapien runes
[2:33:27] 27nellson: @kronozapien fleet foot
[2:33:38] tonicigareta: of course aatrox is ranged, he has a strapped glock in his right pocket, it will be revealed in next patch
[2:33:40] tonicigareta: trust
[2:33:41] lbdubz: @kronozapien swifties
[2:33:42] BruhShaddup: @tonicigareta haha chromosome bandits is a great one
[2:33:44] natsudragneeldsf: Wait bro you champion is mele?
[2:33:45] streptopyo: and extra gold
[2:33:49] rhinololo: if aatrox is ranged that mean gb is ranged malphite is ranged
[2:33:49] casdy8: If that IS ranged to you chat, WOULD YOU say the SAME to the fucking Darius' mains and shit ?????
[2:33:50] thangwibi: swifties also
[2:33:51] kronozapien: @27nellson man is zoomin, and w cant do a shit sadge
[2:33:52] Ogolikus1982: @tonicigareta chromosome bandits gotta be one of the best I heard yet, but yeah its insane, same with stuff like vayne or kalista
[2:33:55] zanzaa321: fleet healing seems kinda busted af
[2:34:07] vladeq8: did the nerf affect tf or still broken?
[2:34:14] entergehenna: i love some ap nunu into tf
[2:34:20] Ogolikus1982: @rhinololo morde is ranged too now
[2:34:27] tonicigareta: @Ogolikus1982 haha thank you, and its literally disgusting, and even if you play passive you will be most useless organism in your lobby and still get flamed
[2:34:29] naayil_: ya you can get ganked but when
[2:34:30] as4noob39: was that not a really troll move by tf?
[2:34:34] as4noob39: 3 platings
[2:34:36] as4noob39: and waves
[2:34:37] tonicigareta: so it doesnt matter how the game ends up, if ur not 15/0 ur getting flamed
[2:34:38] casdy8: Fucking Christ, The duality of chat
[2:34:38] zanzaa321: morde ranged? KEKW
[2:34:40] rhinololo: @Ogolikus1982 yeah forget about it
[2:34:42] godfathertherealone: 600 true damage juicy
[2:34:45] drugerson: if aatrox is range mordekaiser its to because the q and e LUL LUL
[2:34:50] BruhShaddup: what do you think of the possible component nerfs @Naayil
[2:34:53] armaanxakx: Ur jg just ignores the top ranged matchup KEKW
[2:34:59] spectereye: @vladeq8 winrate went down 3-4% so affected
[2:35:00] x_g1ost: yeah garen is ranged hes ult is ranged
[2:35:01] z3urnwi: nt
[2:35:03] as4noob39: close
[2:35:06] AvelloSRT: i rather play vs illaoi than tf
[2:35:09] tonicigareta: because of ranged top players i have guests in my head
[2:35:12] Xyntectic: some nerf
[2:35:13] casdy8: Right chat, right
[2:35:15] Xyntectic: crazy
[2:35:15] thesomeonetodayy: So balanced how a ranged top laner can have 4k hp 500 movement speed and do double the dmg of an adc
[2:35:18] aliensliker: @matoG4 but idk its so dumb, i cant even imagine doing this. i played aatrox a lot and i still cant perform as consistent as naayil
[2:35:18] HajjRogerinho: RIOT
[2:35:19] lbdubz: nice champ rito
[2:35:24] vladeq8: @spectereye so not worth going ad tf anymore right ?
[2:35:24] OkayegBestEmote: he only has 5000 movement speed, just hit him 4Head
[2:35:26] Ogolikus1982: @tonicigareta bro spitting fax its so bad to play, I am a morde otp current meta is just suicide for me
[2:35:26] z3urnwi: @AvelloSRT what is that comparison even? lol
[2:35:27] as4noob39: tf seems balanced enough we should nerf aatrox W
[2:35:29] Arrogfire: stronger than rumble ?
[2:35:32] Xyntectic: wheres the nerf
[2:35:35] Komlin111: illaoi is pretty criminal
[2:35:36] entergehenna: bring back prowlers claw active
[2:35:39] natsudragneeldsf: stronger than irelia?
[2:35:42] eqquilibriuum: is it like tank nida?
[2:35:44] atrocities0: what should riot do to nerf range top
[2:35:45] armaanxakx: Just ban all ranged champs in champ select 4Head
[2:35:45] mostsanetoplaner62: @Naayil would u rather vs ranged toplaner or olaf?
[2:35:45] Bnadryl: Get aatrox a gun
[2:35:49] spectereye: @vladeq8 ad is still okay top lane but not in the other lanes
[2:35:49] eqquilibriuum: ad tank nida?
[2:35:50] Bnadryl: Rapid fire aatrox
[2:35:52] as4noob39: rumble is so fucking annoying to play against
[2:35:53] tonicigareta: @Ogolikus1982 Legit morde is so weak rn, in last 150 games i think i laned vs morde a single time
[2:36:00] zanzaa321: eh rumble cant 100-0 unless melee and i dont see that happening against tf ever LUL
[2:36:08] rossthemighty: is W worth a skill point?
[2:36:09] tonicigareta: @atrocities0 forbid ranged champions on top lane
[2:36:11] naayil_: theres nothing we can do WutFace WutFace
[2:36:12] tonicigareta: or
[2:36:13] baddecisiondanx: fk ghost and fk tf man
[2:36:17] Komlin111: I love playing vs teemo and being blinded for 6 seconds at level 9,when he has only 2 points in q
[2:36:21] tonicigareta: use cait ult in their forehead
[2:36:23] HOPEuROPE999: Rumble R has entered the chat
[2:36:24] lbdubz: @as4noob39 yea the w never pulls for me now unless my enemy stand still thid great
[2:36:24] as4noob39: naayil do you think there is a trend as to how aatrox players on each region play like?
[2:36:27] AvelloSRT: the comparison is that illaoi's E is annoying
[2:36:27] khalidsmalls: u think they will nerf profane ? @Naayil
[2:36:30] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[2:36:34] x_g1ost: they should change the game if ur in top u ccan only pick toplaners
[2:36:36] casdy8: @bnadryl impossible? He's literally bound to his greatsword.
[2:36:37] Ogolikus1982: @tonicigareta I know he doesnt have a big player base since hes so simple but I really like playing him and it hurts my soul that hes so shit
[2:36:43] daniduels: morde is underwhelming
[2:36:44] tonicigareta: @Komlin111 Who doesn't?Thats the best part about league of legends
[2:36:48] armaanxakx: Is he more annoying than vayne
[2:36:55] thesomeonetodayy: @x_g1ost real
[2:36:55] Bnadryl: @casdy8 omg dude chill
[2:36:59] as4noob39: w is shit to the point that removing it completely would not make that big of a difference lmao
[2:37:01] x_g1ost: that would be faire
[2:37:01] godfathertherealone: i had no melee match up today
[2:37:06] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[2:37:15] c3p0demadeira: @x_g1ost doesnt work because you can queue adc and switch with top
[2:37:16] trinketee_in_deinerhood: with bruiser aatrox you would be automatically useless just by getting outpicked right?
[2:37:19] AvelloSRT: adc getting buffed next patch toplane will be fun
[2:37:23] tonicigareta: @Ogolikus1982 Yeah it sucks, im gwen main and she is pretty good rn considering the range top meta, in 2 weeks i went from p3 to e1, im like 4 games from diamond
[2:37:29] casdy8: @bnadryl half joking, im not being serious lol
[2:37:35] Xyntectic: wtf is this champ
[2:37:37] tonicigareta: it was 2 but my teammates had to remind me that all things in life are overshadowed by a 0/15 bot lane
[2:37:40] thangwibi: this gameplay is hurting me so much
[2:37:46] x_g1ost: he can clear u and the wave at the same time

[2:38:00] Komlin111: @tonicigareta I was playing jarven with fleet and his poke didnt feel to bad cus I put 2 points in shield but man the blind duration is silly, and has zero cd when he hits level 13
[2:38:04] Ogolikus1982: @tonicigareta yeah gwen ate well with the new season and change to mage items, mordekaiser didnt really buy full ap anyways but hes at least better than last season
[2:38:22] thesomeonetodayy: Infinite Edge+ Lord Doms and a bunch of adc items got buffed cant wait too see how toplane manages
[2:38:24] aatrixenjoyer: w is so worthless
[2:38:28] Bnadryl: JUST SCRAP W FROM THE GAME
[2:38:35] armaanxakx: BigBrother FF15
[2:38:36] lia_cos_: i swear malph was slowed and he still just gets to walk out of your w lmao
[2:38:40] as4noob39: W is just so shitty oh my god
[2:38:54] rionagh07: @lia_cos_ malph q?
[2:38:54] tonicigareta: @Komlin111 one more things that is disgusting with him is that a good teemo player will never let you get close to the wave so its just a matter of who is willing to get more brain tumor
[2:38:56] xNextGen: lol
[2:38:59] x_g1ost: xd
[2:39:00] lbdubz: would it be okay if he went edge of night instead of profane first against stuff like vayne, quinn and tf?
[2:39:03] phantom_mehdi: Hello @Naayil what do you think of going profane first then following it up with the normal bruiser build?
[2:39:07] Bnadryl: LOL
[2:39:08] as4noob39: worth xd
[2:39:13] casdy8: His W is just non existent rn
[2:39:23] z3urnwi: @phantom_mehdi he said its bad
[2:39:24] AvelloSRT: Aatrox W feels like the worst single ability rn
[2:39:26] tonicigareta: @Ogolikus1982 yeah, the new mage items are pretty good rn on her, altho vs some instances not even that can let me kill the 17/2 kha zix
[2:39:28] Komlin111: @tonicigareta at least j4 can q and flag poke him but bone plating on ranged is super cringe
[2:39:30] casdy8: Yeah
[2:39:38] tonicigareta: and wathc them say top gap
[2:39:38] as4noob39: @phantom_mehdi i like doing it
[2:39:40] daniduels: tf outplayed there so hard
[2:39:40] tonicigareta: 100%
[2:39:45] armaanxakx: No skill quadra
[2:39:46] EmiliamyWaifu: isn't tf nerfed Kappa
[2:39:46] atlanticsunscreen: tf is also right clicking like a mf
[2:39:50] xNextGen: HUH
[2:39:51] Xyntectic: HOW IS HE NERFED
[2:39:51] thesomeonetodayy: Ggs
[2:39:52] BruhShaddup: auto auto auto
[2:39:54] OkayegBestEmote: hey he pressed rightclick
[2:39:59] AvelloSRT: ok
[2:40:07] Ogolikus1982: @tonicigareta gwen suffers from poor tankyness, she heals very well late game unlike mordekaiser but at least he cant get one shotted
[2:40:12] armaanxakx: Ur analogies are something man
[2:40:12] thesomeonetodayy: Tf is just like last patch
[2:40:21] supersayiannn: Twisted Fate thinks that he is in top 10 Tiktok outplays
[2:40:22] chicana709: i think reworking some champion is better then nerfing them 100 times
[2:40:24] tonicigareta: Tf top players are the type of people to turn 50 years old, go to the nearby park and hate on little children playing in the sandbox
[2:40:28] as4noob39: tf is so high skill he has to press W and click on you
[2:40:35] atlanticsunscreen: yes
[2:40:37] Holymanster: He is a badass darkin

[2:40:46] lbdubz: yes
[2:40:47] godfathertherealone: AP TF is picked in mid
[2:40:48] lbdubz: it is
[2:40:49] Xrezaden: tf is pretty consistent
[2:40:51] naayil_: what other champs do you play?
[2:40:53] Xrezaden: in pro
[2:40:53] skeletaa: yeah, tf top blindpick
[2:40:57] Zencmoi: He was pick by mad lion just 40 min ago
[2:40:57] x_g1ost: @LordofMoria21 he is
[2:40:58] Bnadryl: Ur paying the sin of being a one trick unfortunately
[2:40:58] armaanxakx: His W stun with Rapid cannon is pretty good
[2:40:58] gearsquared: tf ad top
[2:40:59] chicana709: only in adc and top
[2:40:59] atrocities0: i miss goredrinker
[2:41:00] tonicigareta: @Ogolikus1982 she is fairly tanky when you do the right build path, 2x hp scale shards and overgrowth+ you buy jaksho, you can end up w 4k hp
[2:41:01] Goodkidmadgame: they pick him as top and adc
[2:41:02] Keatinger: i saw a tristiana tf toplane last night T1 vs GenG I believe
[2:41:04] as4noob39: @godfathertherealone ad in top as well
[2:41:08] Bnadryl: Rock paper scissors game design
[2:41:09] apiretal4: myrwin
[2:41:15] lbdubz: yea last match between geng and t1 pick both ranged top
[2:41:17] medon213: But i thought he got nerfed for 4 patches in a row how is he still op
[2:41:17] lbdubz: XD
[2:41:18] godfathertherealone: @as4noob39 actually?
[2:41:22] Komlin111: watering the team
[2:41:23] godfathertherealone: wow
[2:41:27] armaanxakx: Not even the jg for not helping?
[2:41:39] tonicigareta: @Komlin111 teemo is kinda playable vs if you have a way of slowing him because he is built for top lane, he has no CC to stun you, if your champ doesnt reovlve around aa's he isnt that much of a problem
[2:41:49] thesomeonetodayy: Tf is jsut too fed
[2:41:50] AvelloSRT: u play anything else than aatrox?
[2:42:04] tonicigareta: well yeah but again who will you play vs tf
[2:42:05] Komlin111: @tonicigareta if he doesnt have last pick I can just smash him with olaf
[2:42:06] Ogolikus1982: @tonicigareta makes me realize being tanky as a juggernaut isnt even special anymore when a gwen buy a tank item or smolder goes full buiser and is litereally tankier than me
[2:42:07] x_g1ost: what counter tf ?
[2:42:07] lbdubz: @AvelloSRT he does not
[2:42:10] gearsquared: @medon213 it's only been 3 patches since his buff and he was only picked on 14.4 which was before his recent set of nerfs
[2:42:10] patitooo_: @medon213 4 patches? this is the first time he got nerfed, last patch his ap ratios got nerfed which was useless
[2:42:10] x_g1ost: in top
[2:42:14] lbdubz: he one trick
[2:42:15] tonicigareta: karma top is even worse man
[2:42:21] chicana709: how about switching to mid??
[2:42:25] armaanxakx: Man that's just depressing

[2:43:18] tonicigareta: @Ogolikus1982 Exactly, smolders have 4k hp, adcs in general can buy a single tank item and its gg they are as tanky as you, so generally tanks arent that good rn(apart from poppy, the little shit is broken)
[2:43:23] chicana709: Switch to mid?

[3:13:53] vkurox: this might sound stupid, but how is kayle past 6 in high elo? still easy or start being garbage matchup?
[3:13:55] Quesitou: You're winning the coinflip tho
[3:13:58] 14ghosta: No gnar isn't

[3:14:40] kawai_desu02: can aatrox not trade with qe+w?
[3:14:40] i_am_him_frfr: ppl say bot is a coinflip i say supp is we wre not the same
[3:14:43] ilovemysticmine: Is this never all-in-able?
[3:14:45] Ogolikus1982: your opponent isnt chllanager hes challanged
[3:14:56] KledFlintstone: like is it even fun for cassiopeia to farm whole laning phase instead of picking normal melee champion and trade with enemy?
[3:14:57] Xyntectic: i would ego the 1v1
[3:15:01] Conqmoh: yeahh i love it when enemy ranged top auto atacks me BatChest
[3:15:11] AvelloSRT: jg is not there to will your lane
[3:15:20] wachalkwach: true
[3:15:28] zanzaa321: so champ is without counter picks
[3:15:28] Brock0Lee69: It's not a threesome anymore, it's a Gank For Now on
[3:15:30] zanzaa321: no*
[3:15:38] yureki_: but being more gankable is also a factor in a lane no?
[3:15:39] best_jasuo_korea: FirstTimeChadder

[3:16:47] Bnadryl: Had
[3:16:48] hoaqin100: but like what do you want riot to do, ranged champions being op in toplane is just bc of their nature in being ranged, (except for overtuned champs like vayn and tf) you can't just ban ranged champs from top
[3:16:52] Atrahye: @z3urnwi ok chill thats not true xd
[3:17:00] TDS_morveux: Reksai is one of the most useless champ right now
[3:17:06] ilovemysticmine: Is there really no point you can ever fight her?
[3:17:17] natsudragneeldsf: Bro i miss the times when lethality aatrox was bad

[3:18:27] baddecisiondanx: @ilovemysticmine her sustained dps will run him down

[3:18:46] Dinko_Minovic: How u doin? Do you have girl?
[3:18:47] 12marlon04: @SerWitchKing she uses W and you're dead
[3:18:58] kumbo01: @murtadtha20 lower the sustain
[3:19:00] neossenger06: What time do you have right now? It's 1am for me right now
[3:19:03] PoUwUer: annoying lane
[3:19:10] gabrielwasneverhere10: the solution to ranged top for riot is make ranged characters for top lane get negative move speed until a caring amount of time
[3:19:16] unluckym3: close
[3:19:21] hoaqin100: @lucky_oneee he's not only complaining about ghost but ranged in general even if they don't have ghost, no?
[3:19:21] conxfoviazz: bro wtf
[3:19:22] junpei2012: You got stunned? How
[3:19:27] Katan1377: no skill
[3:19:29] callfromthenorth: fun
[3:19:30] sshdhhdhdhjx: which scales better lethality or bruiser
[3:19:31] NikoX_TV: no matter where u lock , when u get knocked back in to cass she can stun you
[3:19:31] conxfoviazz: nice riot
[3:19:34] NikoX_TV: look*
[3:19:42] wachalkwach: RIOT
[3:19:46] lelouchezde: Side eye
[3:19:48] natsudragneeldsf: So do you think a champion that would just counter ranged champs would be good for the game rn? Like would it make ranged toplaners be less effective?
[3:19:51] Bnadryl: Wtf
[3:19:53] best_jasuo_korea: xd
[3:19:59] SerWitchKing: @Ogolikus1982 I mean, I've seen these matchups in KR, and the Aatrox players always try to fight
[3:20:01] natsudragneeldsf: so you don t pick ranged just in case they would pick the anti range?
[3:20:12] conxfoviazz: by any chance you think ranged top lanners will the nerfed?
[3:20:14] z3urnwi: @atrahye so you telling nayil is getting skill issued now? Clueless
[3:20:29] casdy8: Or perhaps, make ranged champions unviable for top lane and make the lane suitable for melee matchups like it's supposed to be in the first place
[3:20:31] lucky_oneee: @hoaqin100 And ranged in general usually goes ghost and let, if people didn't have the absurd move speed we have now (plus dashes and stunts) ranged top wouldnt be a problem
[3:20:33] bausenlaw: Fizz pings going off lmao
[3:20:51] callfromthenorth: this fizz is fuming bro
[3:21:05] Bnadryl: All ranged get a debuff on toplane, fixed

[3:21:13] Cany0Q: Cany0Q subscribed with Prime. 
[3:21:21] NikoX_TV: @Bnadryl that would screw gnar
[3:21:26] z3urnwi: @atrahye what im saying is that a 1st time cassio player would still win here
[3:21:29] muhaa_a: when I lose i get -31lp but when i win i get +21lp and every time i have decent score. Why do I lose so much lp when I lose?

[3:22:23] Daveesz_: the state of toplane is soo sad
[3:22:29] elgoblinnoo: household diff
[3:22:31] neossenger06: how often is there a melee champ vs you?
[3:22:33] z3urnwi: @atrahye half of the ranged top players are first timing this meta btw
[3:22:41] natsudragneeldsf: @Atrahye you got braindmg or somethin? xD
[3:22:42] gabrielwasneverhere10: watching put dry gameplay
[3:22:52] Mrewey: do you only play aatrox
[3:23:14] muhaa_a: when I lose i get -31lp but when i win i get +21lp and every time i have decent score. Why do I lose so much lp when I lose? why is this happening when i have 0 20 bot lane
[3:23:19] Xphonic29: Is it better to flip the fight if your team is losing in a game like that last one?
[3:23:19] wwwm3105: cuz in mid there is assasins and other mages
[3:23:25] wwwm3105: in top they get free matchups
[3:23:35] Daveesz_: riot should implement two bans for 1 player honestly, with all these 170+ champs
[3:23:36] z3urnwi: @atrahye you shouldnt have continued this talk bro
[3:23:42] Katan1377: ranged top is just poke damage and no skill
[3:23:46] chrisrealog: @muhaa_a its not about your score. If you win more you get more LP
[3:23:46] neossenger06: if its again not melee..
[3:23:46] gabrielwasneverhere10: it could be worse because can’t top doesn’t exist yet
[3:24:08] casdy8: These matchups today are nowhere close to be "fun".
[3:24:13] chrisrealog: @muhaa_a you need to improve your MMR
[3:24:15] Komlin111: only naafiri can point and click ranged champs

[4:50:46] oops_i_forgot_my_username: @draco_silence There is a trend where riot is removing every single item/spell/rune weakness that ranged characters have. For example tiny example recent cleaver changes where ranged champions get the same movement speed as melees

[5:31:55] kurimaboi: aint exhaust a thing against these ranged so u slow em down?
[5:31:55] c3p0demadeira: remove every ranged from the game
[5:31:57] minatozakiLoL: when its 2 ranged and a third ranged of supp its playable
[5:31:59] anees_151: pleez play skin dry
[5:32:00] armpit_sniff: ranged top sucks now tho what are you talking about
[5:32:00] welp142: they should just make it not possible to pick ranged top lol, clearly wont happen tho leTroll
[5:32:02] danyanboss123: do you still see kennen?
[5:32:03] anees_151: drx
[5:32:04] minatozakiLoL: maybe 3 with a enchanter
[5:32:09] cryosaan: camille mid?
[5:32:10] Manuuscriipt: UFC TOPLANE
[5:32:17] Abuswai123: @danyanboss123 its was in last game
[5:32:22] salega96: back then when ryze and gnar were the only ranged toplaners good ol times
[5:32:25] RedonicRedfire: occasional enchanter ranged support too
[5:32:31] AndrewRicc: You're team is full melee xd
[5:32:34] mozartora: swap with gragas hes good into tristana
[5:32:35] danyanboss123: @Abuswai123 oh ok thanks!
[5:32:40] Azelyth: @yuumomoe true, but they could maybe balancing it by nerfing base regen/health
[5:32:45] danyanboss123: just joined stream so didn't know
[5:32:50] AMDCPU: because every1 wants top cuz its so strong
[5:32:53] ShuIkin: ask graggy to swap
[5:33:01] cryosaan: look at graggfy running
[5:33:09] minatozakiLoL: you will get top and then enemy will be a karma top
[5:33:09] editorsecimi: my man gets autofilled when enemy toplaner picks melee
[5:33:09] baddecisiondanx: yeah!!! my favorite skin!!!
[5:33:10] shigairomiamo: there are more camille sups than top
[5:33:36] RedonicRedfire: camil top is garbo lol
[5:33:47] minatozakiLoL: and on midlane its not even that bad
[5:33:48] yuumomoe: top somehow seems like both the least impactful and also 1v9able role i dont get it
[5:33:49] mozartora: why no comet?
[5:33:51] minatozakiLoL: cuzz short lane
[5:34:31] ze1ef: easy fix for ranged top is remove ms on fleet for ranged, lower ghost ms on ranged and buff base ms on melee champs
[5:34:44] elrhat: does being in midlane give u any sort of inherent advantage or disavantage vs range, relative to top?
[5:35:11] cryosaan: why did mods delete bros comment it was just a normal one
[5:35:12] sseff4: her passive is so annoying
[5:35:31] ROWLERI: @cryosaan to prevent ppl on flaming and sharing infos

[5:35:46] cryosaan: @ROWLERI ah ok
[5:35:54] c3p0demadeira: as aatrox is it bad to go even ?
[5:36:20] editorsecimi: @ze1ef or just bring back "kill = more" ghost and nerf fleet to oblibion and nerf lethal late game

[6:13:55] ShuIkin: fiora players are so different lol some of them never W and some of them W everything
[6:13:57] darkroasti: @LucianStoleUrBike makes sense it looks better on loading screen if he was holding the sword with the bigger arm

[6:22:23] darkroasti: i feel like leathal only work in pro plays cause of team fight
