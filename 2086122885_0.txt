[0:32:57] Pinkaoz: @WonderboltBipen how did he get for last hits wth
[0:33:31] WonderboltBipen: Senna doesn't farm unitl late game when you go the support item if she farms at all
[0:33:41] WonderboltBipen: the Ornn gets the farm in lane so senna can get more souls
[0:34:18] Pinkaoz: @WonderboltBipen yea ik how it works but vs ziggs bard he was getting poked 24/7 when he went for any cs no?
[0:34:20] Pinkaoz: as a melee

[0:58:13] Amaresu_: HE S BACK
[0:58:37] Amaresu_: but how useless is renekton if he goes hexdrinker btw 💀
[0:59:07] Amaresu_: its nbd he s rumble tbh
[0:59:21] Amaresu_: inspired is wasting his time not playing for kalista lane to get bwipo a wave xd
[1:00:01] Amaresu_: was nice try by palafox
[1:00:16] Amaresu_: i respect players who try that even if it doesnt come off
[1:00:43] Amaresu_: yup and steraks is too op on renekton
[1:00:46] Amaresu_: with 700 hp ult
[1:00:53] Amaresu_: makes it give you 2k hp shield with cleaver and lvl 16
[1:01:04] Amaresu_: better to just sit on cowl and go mercs later or something.
[1:01:12] Amaresu_: or visage 4th
[1:01:24] TacoTimeAllTheTime: whats the tech behind farming nautlius
[1:01:42] PXRKMusic: @TacoTimeAllTheTime if senna last hits minions, she lets less of her passive stacks
[1:01:42] Amaresu_: he s ahead, doesnt need to he just wins, he has ignite too
[1:01:51] TacoTimeAllTheTime: oh i see
[1:01:57] PXRKMusic: senna passive -> stats + gold
[1:02:09] Amaresu_: he has nimbus he s chilling
[1:02:29] PXRKMusic: allows for 2 people to be itemized and strong while having good scaling
[1:02:50] Amaresu_: the senna rotation for grubs and top from lpl
[1:02:52] TacoTimeAllTheTime: interesting, id imagine a better champ for farming than naut but yeah iguess perma cc is good
[1:03:05] Amaresu_: and naut shifts mid
[1:03:07] Amaresu_: good good
[1:03:28] PXRKMusic: @TacoTimeAllTheTime yea in pro play having the 100% cc of naut ult is very valuable
[1:03:33] Amaresu_: @TacoTimeAllTheTime nrg played it last weekand huhi was literally unkillable. go find the game it was hilarious
[1:04:05] Amaresu_: what is massu doing
[1:04:09] Amaresu_: in what universe you turn on rumble
[1:04:18] Amaresu_: with no exh/barrier
[1:04:43] Amaresu_: classic
[1:04:50] PXRKMusic: NOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:04:56] Amaresu_: look at renekton's build bro, does it matter if he got the shut down? xD
[1:05:11] Amaresu_: he s going hex stride
[1:05:25] PXRKMusic: bwipo is unironically stridebreaker salesman
[1:05:32] Amaresu_: it made sense yesterday from impact in that game but he went straight stride into steraks randuins and it was perfect vs double adc.
[1:05:35] Amaresu_: but this .. nah
[1:06:27] Amaresu_: i mean they give up drag
[1:07:12] PXRKMusic: usually senna is like
[1:07:17] PXRKMusic: 4 stacks per min
[1:07:28] Amaresu_: meanwhile rekkles senna monkaW
[1:08:42] Amaresu_: its just geng strat to pick hypercarry for peyz and camp his lane cause he s bad laner usually and then play enchanter + tanks and sit on him. its how they beat t1 cause t1 perma plays skill check disrespect drafts.
[1:09:12] Amaresu_: but t1 ddidnt show up, bad day at the office and draft wasnt great either.
[1:09:37] Amaresu_: low key good for them to lose that and fix up for playoffs cause no other team is a threat for them.
[1:12:25] Amaresu_: naut lived so long rofl
[1:12:28] Amaresu_: worth
[1:12:34] PXRKMusic: AH BWIPO TP'D ANYWAY
[1:12:38] PXRKMusic: SSIBAL
[1:13:23] Amaresu_: they re all egoing so much
[1:14:01] Amaresu_: big part of senna being broken is fleet tbh, best keystone in the game and its still not being nerfed.
[1:16:42] poet1ka: hey have a nice stream
[1:16:52] juvenileviet: watch party
[1:16:58] poet1ka: Viper are we gonna play some Riven games after the match?

[1:19:20] Amaresu_: lee sin is useless

[1:22:09] Amaresu_: give it play for double deathcap spike
[1:22:23] Amaresu_: senna going rfc as well instead of ldr

[5:26:21] LunarBladeee: Isnt lcs buyin not played for?
[5:26:23] Chrisssan: imo, franchising was the worst decision LCS made in terms of competitiveness.

[5:27:23] Chrisssan: i would like to see NA do well internationally, but the expectations are so far down in the gutter next to dinosaur bones
[5:27:27] nbkingkkk: even with franchising esports as a whole is a business thats always losing money so imagine it without franchising
[5:27:44] GoodCookiesUnite: is gragas a meta pick?
[5:28:08] soraleone: what do you think would bring players back and even new players to the game in NA? @Viper

[5:30:09] Maxed_Son: I promise I’m not being an ass I’m just curious, what is riots stance on buying Smurf accounts? I thought it wasn’t allowed? I’m curious because I’ve seen them advertised on streams before.
[5:31:32] nbkingkkk: its legal to sell prositution services but its illegal to buy sorta deal
[5:31:32] GoodCookiesUnite: GoodCookiesUnite subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:31:40] DillBlowBargains: you thanks for streaming this. def better than watching the original broadcast
[5:31:51] Chrisssan: don't you think it's stupid that Riot is not makign level 30 purchasable in cash shop?this would remove the buying smurf industry and Riot would rake in so much cash
[5:31:53] Maxed_Son: it’s just a gray area then, fair enough. That’s what I figured. Thanks
[5:32:12] KingVeerChand: tbh if I were to come back maybe I could save trynd
[5:32:18] Maxed_Son: Chris they don’t want Smurf accounts
[5:32:55] Chrisssan: @Maxed_Son that's not true, riot allows smurf to exist, not just account sharing/purchased accounts
[5:32:57] KingVeerChand: XD thank you king
[5:33:40] DillBlowBargains: trynd was a solid pick last season. seems like he completely fell off the map
[5:34:48] yummydog: quad Pog
[5:34:50] Maxed_Son: no, it’s true. They have said they are against “Smurf” accounts because of the low elo imbalance. It’s prob the only reason they don’t let you buy ranked on accounts.
[5:35:10] lolkotek: vipeRAVE
[5:36:03] DillBlowBargains: @Chrisssan if that were the case then we would be amazing because the US would be trying to extract the..fossil....fuels......

[5:36:21] Canero62: Canero62 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! <3
[5:37:03] Chrisssan: @Maxed_Son whatever you believe bro. they may not like what is happneing currently, but their policy has always been and it still is to allow smurf.
[5:37:31] DillBlowBargains: playing safe up top
[5:37:38] lolkotek: vipeRAVE
[5:40:14] DillBlowBargains: yeah idk why faisal decided to run so far forward the first time
[5:40:18] kylerarc: grag usually so safe
[5:40:49] kylerarc: grasp seems tough to play tho like how often can i auto renekton without taking a chunk lol
[5:41:37] kylerarc: i love senna naut combo
[5:41:51] DillBlowBargains: there we go
[5:41:54] TYLER1__PLAY______VARIETY: wow

[5:43:26] rewinz5: sajed is my goat
[5:43:29] Chrisssan: well, now that smolder got stacks off the teamfight, its a matter of time before auto win
[5:43:56] kylerarc: what is the stack mechanic off champs?
[5:44:02] kylerarc: omg
[5:44:41] DillBlowBargains: renekton so
[5:44:45] DillBlowBargains: ResidentSleeper
[5:44:51] DillBlowBargains: how do you play that champ
[5:45:21] Chrisssan: @kylerarc senna gets 10% crit, 20 units auto range
[5:45:27] Chrisssan: per 20 stacks
[5:45:29] Trelkus: Srtty is him
[5:45:33] kylerarc: no i meant smolder
[5:45:52] kylerarc: srtty is awesome idk why he quit streaming
[5:46:15] Chrisssan: 25, circle AOE, 125 = circle + Cone aoe, 225 = 6% execution + elder burn + AOE from previous stacks
[5:46:31] kylerarc: only wincon is senna lol
[5:46:57] kylerarc: no i meant do you get stacks off champs too?
[5:47:17] kylerarc: oh wtf
[5:47:28] kylerarc: takedown or jsut trading with Q E
[5:47:39] kylerarc: hes him
[5:47:47] kylerarc: srtty should be in lcs tbh

[5:49:27] k1ra1ite: kappachunguas
[5:49:33] halli606: ic ty
[5:49:49] kylerarc: @halli606 one way to get a sense is to google "na leaderboards lol" and it shows top ranked players too
[5:49:57] k1ra1ite: top usually gets astrogapped
[5:50:00] Chrisssan: lmao FLY inted
[5:50:03] k1ra1ite: maybe jg or bot

[6:02:10] DePreSs1oOn: gg vipeDeadge
[6:02:16] Chrisssan: im so glad riot gutted Smolder's stack mechanics.
[6:02:18] kylerarc: did better than i thought
[6:02:32] Chrisssan: smolder has to get like 400 stacks before getting the 6% threshold
[6:02:36] Trelkus: delete smolder
[6:02:45] k1ra1ite: no it scales off items
[6:02:51] HCHeroineNinja: @Viper yoooo viper, do you know that there's a bug that lets you doublecast abilities similar to the S cancel?

[6:28:34] Kylon1235: thx
[6:29:47] Chrisssan: how did FLY get away with 3 broken picks
[6:29:56] Chrisssan: Voli, Udyr, Kalista wtf
[6:31:02] waterjiggler6200: shojin rush wukong jg seems awful, also wukong jg idk
[6:31:24] waterjiggler6200: there’s no way it’s not profane or sundered sky rush on wukong idk
[6:31:48] ryan_nnc: Her Viper Love your content
[6:33:48] waterjiggler6200: idk wukong can’t be good here idk if poppy was banned or couldn’t be picked but they needed a jg to dive bot lvl 3
[6:34:06] Chrisssan: i can't even think that far ahead, here is viper showing us how to play macro
[6:35:18] Kylon1235: +1 dragon
[6:35:28] Gabb049: nice, they need more team fights like this one
[6:35:30] AnOldDinosaur: varus is such a powerful champ
[6:35:38] Kylon1235: SN keeps being down objectives and kills but up gold
[6:35:46] waterjiggler6200: idk they just going to lose when shochi dosent have flash
[6:35:58] lolkotek: hmm
[6:36:03] waterjiggler6200: it’s literally all on neeko wukong
[6:36:12] kylerarc: wtf karma top feels so broken
[6:37:00] Kylon1235: YO
[6:37:01] Kylon1235: HUGE
[6:37:08] Gabb049: amazing D:
[6:37:08] Chrisssan: that synergy is crazy
[6:37:19] waterjiggler6200: that was just dirty int from chime tbh
[6:37:28] Chrisssan: individually, i expect FLY to smash, but SN is doing great in terms of synergy
[6:40:42] Chrisssan: wow thats some crazy outplay
[6:40:44] DePreSs1oOn: vipeCHEER vipeCHEER
[6:40:47] Chrisssan: AND THATS HOW THE COOKIE CRUMBLES
[6:42:05] somanydashes: they always flank on something like akali in LCK and LPL
[6:42:11] somanydashes: but NA never flanks
[6:42:16] saumrian: wait why does NACL do BO3 BOT LCS DOESNT HOW RIGGED
[6:42:43] Intrepidai: especially with 8 lcs teams they really should make it b03
[6:42:45] Chrisssan: @saumrian its because of stagnant viewership. They scrapped it after 2 seasons of down in viewership
[6:43:26] EZVeske: EZVeske subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! vipeLove
[6:44:33] waterjiggler6200: Kalista is so useless in this game with this build actually tho
[6:44:34] masterfdestruction: how big is the jump from lcs and lcs chall
[6:44:42] waterjiggler6200: imagine she has yommus opportunity edge of night
[6:45:27] waterjiggler6200: he was 3-0 and then he’s just actual useless
[6:45:33] waterjiggler6200: only Cassio can carry
[6:45:48] Chrisssan: shouldn't srtty be pushing top wave?
[6:47:22] waterjiggler6200: shochi losing flash is bad
[6:48:09] Chrisssan: i thought udyr would run them down. wtf happened?
[6:48:21] waterjiggler6200: udyr is a tft training dummy at this point
[6:48:56] waterjiggler6200: problem is all Cassio needs is time which udyr and voli give her so she just goes gigga
[6:49:03] iiCroshy: Viper!! Whats up
[6:49:10] sudo1v9: this inst terminus buff patch or is it?
[6:49:49] Chrisssan: Kenvi deserves a raise
[6:49:51] DePreSs1oOn: damn

[6:53:56] Chrisssan: wouldnt jaksho be better on kalista?
[6:54:26] sudo1v9: abyssal just cheap and spike
[6:54:27] kylerarc: is building serpents bad on riven if team wont build
[6:54:29] Baoboab: jaksho terminus would be better
[6:55:03] masterfdestruction: @Baoboab for who
[6:55:07] lolkotek: respekt
[6:55:12] Baoboab: Kalista
[6:56:05] Chrisssan: not to back seat game, but i feel like banshee would've been better on cassio this game
[6:56:15] masterfdestruction: was quad ever supposed to be on the main team, but then jensen is just so good
[6:56:24] Chrisssan: so many fights are decided by a cc combo. if she can land her ult, then it stops their wombo combo
[6:57:24] kylerarc: bro karma top seems insane
[6:57:31] k1ra1ite: purple no dmg xdd

[7:01:17] Intrepidai: @DeChape yeah sniper got the W today
[7:02:56] AngryIndianMan: dark mode
[7:03:05] Intrepidai: i use the old reddit every time
[7:03:17] UZIRedd: do you have a dark mode extension on chrome?
[7:03:29] Intrepidai: in your url instead of www use old if you wanna try it @Viper
[7:04:27] Vitalix: Good to see the nice words about Sniper
[7:04:31] UZIRedd: if you are using the dark reader chrome extension it could be breaking the site
[7:04:39] Intrepidai: LCS seems more competitive and fun to watch
[7:05:22] Chrisssan: I SWEAR Doublelift is lucky that he got his rise during the surgence of Esports. Otherwise, he wouldnt even be able to work at McDonalds
[7:06:04] UZIRedd: corny
[7:06:10] Chrisssan: "He won't post the message". if you have nothing to hide, why are you doing it?
[7:06:26] k1ra1ite: drama alert xdd
[7:06:41] k1ra1ite: honestly na should just be the drama region
[7:06:49] GeneralSniper: @revenge 🐀
[7:07:03] Chrisssan: LCS people are literal childs with zero awareness when it comes to PR. woudl've been better for Dodo to ignore all of it
[7:07:29] Vitalix: @GeneralSniper Good stuff lately my guy much love <3
[7:07:38] kylerarc: best of twos are lame

[7:15:26] kylerarc: sn has better draft i think
[7:15:34] Chrisssan: 14.3
[7:15:38] Chrisssan: no way its 14.4
[7:15:53] Chrisssan: pro scenes are always at least 2 weeks behind
[7:15:54] k1ra1ite: xayah rakan xdd d

[7:16:19] kylerarc: lcs does live patch now yeah
[7:16:21] Rektyynoob: @viper do you like Rakan Xayah?
[7:16:22] lolkotek: am i trippin vipeStare
[7:16:25] kylerarc: i prefer live patch
[7:16:43] Chrisssan: pro scenes never did live. They ahve to give 2 weeks buffer. this was confirmed with LCK and LPL
[7:16:55] Jake_o_saurus: Why isn't jinx good??

[7:19:25] kylerarc: @k1ra1ite who? id say tf vs renekton should get prio
[7:19:35] k1ra1ite: sn
[7:19:42] Chrisssan: @kylerarc this  live patch change is stupid. there was a 2 weeks buffer for patches. just exactly how does this benefit LCS?
[7:19:59] viper_fanboi: viper_fanboi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! yeeeeeee
[7:20:09] k1ra1ite: kindred ego pick PepeLaugh

[7:20:43] lolkotek: @kylerarc i agree, keeps it current but just my opinion
[7:20:51] Chrisssan: @kylerarc it doesn't benefit LCS in any way. they're going to get stomped harder in international scene in even more embarassign way
[7:21:06] kylerarc: i can see that because then they have to go play off live patch
[7:21:11] k1ra1ite: yea i think we lost
[7:21:12] k1ra1ite: LOL
[7:21:17] kylerarc: but when did we have chance international anyway

[7:24:10] kylerarc: @lolkotek google "lcs schedule" if he doesnt answer

[7:26:28] Chrisssan: i feel like theyre both being too careful to not "screw up" because this is the last of 3 games
[7:27:10] k1ra1ite: Copeless
[7:27:10] serbington: If this is solo q kenvi egos that and they kill both

[7:28:16] serbington: easy
[7:28:44] k1ra1ite: their win con is jg gap with 3 losing lanes xdd
[7:29:00] Chrisssan: 3
[7:29:11] Chrisssan: SRTTY MENTAL BOOM
[7:29:19] serbington: I’ve never watched challengers before but it’s fun watching them in solo q and now a more pro setting
[7:29:29] k1ra1ite: bros like I had 16 cs to 4
[7:31:24] k1ra1ite: he couldnt play safe for 2 seconds xdd '
[7:31:58] kylerarc: i think rumble instead of TF would have been good
[7:32:01] k1ra1ite: he has alot of gold
[7:32:56] TimR3: just auto the hwei 4Head surely he's in range
[7:32:58] Chrisssan: is Shiv rush because of wave clear? i've been told taht kraken is better for skirmish
[7:33:40] k1ra1ite: illegal activity
[7:33:44] moonswath: worth
[7:34:12] k1ra1ite: he could have just tpd xdd
[7:34:32] serbington: Kenvi going dmg build too

[7:37:01] hamopekara: ad tf nerfed?
[7:37:09] Tonster11: is this 14.4 or 14.5
[7:37:18] serbington: Sheiden and Kenvi have been high elo in solo q for so long @ztsoat3
[7:37:30] Tonster11: makes sense
[7:38:28] Chrisssan: 3 marks sounds little but then i remember that this isn't a solo queue game
[7:38:31] Intrepidai: @Chrisssan nah not wave clear just cheaper than kraken for decent stats
[7:39:18] k1ra1ite: naram
[7:39:43] Intrepidai: ok ok
[7:39:50] Chrisssan: THATS BALANCED
