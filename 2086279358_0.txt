[3:50:59] biskup17521: @insectzix trundle is prettier tho
[3:50:59] Neuro_Alpha: it's useless i guess
[3:51:03] samura1jax: better to have more points in other abilities, stack check matchup
[3:51:05] ViLLePLaTTe: Pillar doesn't help vs invincible champ
[3:51:07] romierome31: i mean u can use it after the spin
[3:51:28] ViLLePLaTTe: but he spins again before the 27 minute cooldown

[3:52:10] Nightbot: try not to let him stack fury he gets fury by autoing minions so just slow push vs him, kite around pillar when he ults if possible
[3:52:10] ViLLePLaTTe: Soraka would've won that

[3:54:36] agentmyrie67: how's mana top lane on him ,still a problem ?
[3:54:40] insectzix: I guess something like that @dunkalax
[3:54:41] romierome31: see
[3:54:43] romierome31: after the spin
[3:54:44] ViLLePLaTTe: Calculated
[3:54:54] insectzix: !thinking
[3:54:54] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
[3:55:03] ViLLePLaTTe: Mana is a problem early
[3:55:03] Nightbot: trundieMAD Not enough Mana TrundleDance CapybaraStare

[4:16:23] admir128: did you everytought what would happen if both teams /ff at same time
[4:16:28] admir128: !thinking
[4:16:28] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
[4:16:44] skyway11111: @admir128 red side loses

[5:16:28] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm
[5:16:34] YorrichiTypeZero: @ArtokArtok ye that u can summon 2 maidens up to 3

[6:07:53] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm
