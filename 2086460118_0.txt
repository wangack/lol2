[3:45:30] lKuma: @feetofdeath Well, if that's the case, we might see a new Kinkmaster Darius skin line, leading to a whole new meta where champions are too distracted by their new roles in the League of Extraordinary Spankings. Would this finally balance the game, or just make top lane a more... 'invigorating' place to be?

[4:58:27] oskicon: yeah but shit does just get worse over time even if ;you do practice
[4:58:55] real_true_jesus: no way in hell a 50 year old can beat up a 25 year old given both trained in the same discipline and equally in terms of profesionalism,   but year a 50 year old TRAINED can absolutely crush a 25 year old couch potatoe
