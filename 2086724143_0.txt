[1:48:59] HighVoltageOnEm: I’m gonna take a rip of the penjamin
[1:49:44] lord_reksai: @datspec jungle is really strong if you play a late game jungler and get 20kills early game so you can carry your team who doesn't want to win :D
[1:49:44] nutvo: 1/3 jungler just solokilled a 7 kill varus, yes bot is weak
[1:50:08] DuckieFried: wasnt really a solo kill though, he was already like 100 hp

[1:50:54] nwa4lifeTV: they coin flipping LUL
[1:51:03] ChicoLoLxD: ahhh the classic baron throw

[1:52:26] daytonaghost: @Santorin so you would say support and jg are the most impactful and easiest to carry with in solo que?
[1:53:15] THE_ARKAYN: Jg stronger than mid?
[1:53:23] Alveneb: mega agree
[1:53:25] unclepecos: that is the only correct take
[1:53:26] Alveneb: supp is insane
[1:53:27] daytonaghost: @Santorin what's so op about support? I'm curious because I've been playing a lot of support and jg lately
[1:53:38] Alveneb: supp roam power is crazy
[1:54:45] Deathbooms: Senna in general is BS OP
[1:55:35] YISP: we can go back to Noone wanting to play support because all your money goes on vision
[1:55:38] nwa4lifeTV: @Santorin how u feel about the dorans blade rush like they do in lpl?
[1:57:05] lord_reksai: avg senna player autoing from 3 screens away
[1:58:03] nwa4lifeTV: in lpl they rush frozen heart after sundered sky but i think tiamat 3rd proc is far superior
[1:59:04] Alveneb: aatrox is actually disgusting
[1:59:15] koushik_10: jgl is just a supporting role
[1:59:17] Alveneb: the reset is too op, and this shit is like this for 10+ patches

[2:03:48] Deathbooms: It is kinda boring now

[2:46:30] nwa4lifeTV: 4Head
[2:46:47] nwa4lifeTV: u forgot what happened once they turned hollywood

[2:54:22] Ab176: that way your support can kill them all
[2:54:44] nwa4lifeTV: agreed
[2:54:51] Rafukyo: smolder works at volt. he sent you special deliivery/

[2:57:33] joffbozoss: Selfmade doesn't like mrdukyagirl, but then again selfmade doesn't like anyone
[2:57:36] Draelon12: @GettingBetterAtEverything as Santorini puts it, he's in tellatubby-lo so it's fine lmao
[2:57:49] GettingBetterAtEverything: LUL
[2:57:52] annehappy318: @Santorin is reksai good with red smite or better blue smite?
[2:58:22] Ultranage: Viewers on your GF´s stream, can hear you scream. :-P
[2:59:02] nwa4lifeTV: the iceborn paying off
[2:59:10] mr_sizzler007: can we see a reksai game next @santorin

[2:59:55] stoicHolcan: agreed, i hate when my mid laners roll over and take away all my map pressure
[3:00:09] kill3rflam3: kass gets good at 11
[3:00:12] Nyanra: @Ultranage wife*
[3:00:15] annehappy318: @Santorin why blue smite overall good for her?
[3:00:45] angelopuza: What about asol? Do you categorize him similar to kassadin but in his case he just needs items
[3:00:58] NightShado81: Give me ahri neeko mid all day over kassa or asol
[3:01:38] angelopuza: XD

[3:02:58] Konihan: Yeah i get you, in league you're always learning
[3:03:05] everyman322: I don't like when my favorite champs are meta because then riot nerfs them into oblivion shortly after
[3:03:20] mr_sizzler007: sona jungle sweetheartEyebrows
[3:03:24] NightShado81: @santorin did you see dirk and tunneler nerfs?

[3:04:07] rvend: whoa dommy mommy
[3:04:30] freethejiggy: Would you recommend getting to high elo before diversifying champ pool?
[3:04:48] Nyanra: i hope its qiqi jungle!
[3:04:59] NightShado81: @nyanra most likely tali
[3:05:13] Nyanra: its pimp daddy1233
[3:05:15] everyman322: @freethejiggy depends if your goal is to get to high elo or have fun (and depends what is fun for you)
[3:05:18] Nyanra: PogU
[3:05:42] Nyanra: ya

[3:06:31] Broitone: https://www.twitch.tv/kaypea
[3:07:12] Ab176: I wish they would remove leashing
[3:07:41] everyman322: champs with good aoe
[3:08:07] SilexFPS: whats your fav champ to jungle with rn
[3:08:28] Konihan: @Ab176 I mean, is not mandatory, like Santo is saying, any champ can full clear, but low elo jungle ethier dont know that or are too lazy
[3:10:38] stoicHolcan: i thought this was a voli 1 trick stream
[3:10:42] everyman322: @Konihan in low elo you don't lose as much in lane from leashing, and if enemy team leashes and your team doesn't, your jg will reverse snowball
[3:11:00] SilexFPS: both are fun indeed
[3:11:03] Bazeloth: Why are you going for boots first buy?
[3:11:50] Ab176: yeah but im 200 LP and sometimes you still get jg who run it down because they really want a leash
[3:12:17] DMatta: KEKW
[3:12:20] WDZepplin: KEKW
[3:12:31] Konihan: KEKW

[3:13:26] Nyanra: PepoG
[3:13:36] realspecialist: Can you explain again the evelyn combo?
[3:14:26] Nyanra: @realspecialist you E - Q camps, then after throwing every Q out you W while your abilities are on CD
[3:14:34] Nyanra: then E - Q again
[3:15:00] realspecialist: @Nyanra thanks a lot
[3:16:16] wilyuhm: phew
[3:18:37] lolvatn: any advice on getting past 400 lp ?
[3:19:52] DanielFromBrazil1: Qiana mad? :tf:
[3:21:14] Ab176: for me easiest way to learn was to vod review every death
[3:21:17] WDZepplin: any advice on getting past bronze II? Kappa
[3:21:19] Draelon12: learning how to get carried - an underrated skill!
[3:21:43] Bazeloth: i feel like im good at macro, but im not good mechanically lol
[3:22:15] Bazeloth: i can play malzahar but i sucka t katerina
[3:22:23] Nyanra: poor qiyana
[3:22:33] lolvatn: yeah then it’s definitely mechanics and being tilt proof
[3:22:53] greas3: @Bazeloth I feel like people who think they  are good at macro are usually the worst at macro lol
[3:23:21] Bazeloth: @greas3 i feel like i can push very well and go for objectices, but i die a lot in fights
[3:23:32] Bazeloth: i like to stay at the back
[3:23:38] NightShado81: @santorin what's your fav role to play after jungle?
[3:24:43] WDZepplin: xDD SURPRISE MODAFUCKA
[3:24:44] GettingBetterAtEverything: kill delivery
[3:24:48] DoctorWafflecone: At this point it looks like bullying xD
[3:24:54] nipab: do you know how mad he is :D
[3:24:56] greas3: @Bazeloth Just have to review your fights and see what's killing you
[3:25:10] Nyanra: @nipab who?
[3:25:18] nipab: blue
[3:25:29] DoctorWafflecone: Never doubted
[3:25:34] NightShado81: Chat does he play any kha?
[3:25:38] GettingBetterAtEverything: the maths were there and they were good
[3:26:04] Nyanra: @nipab who is blue
[3:26:12] NachoLazer_: What is that regen, disgusting champ
[3:26:29] nipab: @Nyanra qiyana
[3:26:38] Bazeloth: So why did your voice go up when you said "im at 6 health"? KEKW
[3:26:46] GettingBetterAtEverything: hahaha ahri try to dash out of this LUL LUL
[3:26:59] TorqueBandit: is Eve still giga disgusting?
[3:27:15] dennykruger: @TorqueBandit 5% scaling reduce does literally nothing
[3:27:16] Nyanra: poppy was chilling
[3:27:58] DoctorWafflecone: That lucky smolder Q
[3:28:10] WDZepplin: its over
[3:28:26] WDZepplin: that smolder champion needs to be removed from the game
[3:28:34] dkvukster: SUPdoss is a pro player ?
[3:28:42] NachoLazer_: It's only his 125 upgrade haha
[3:28:49] dkvukster: i've seen him in some challenger lobbies
[3:28:54] NachoLazer_: Doesnt look like he has execute yet
[3:29:27] greggey: When do you take that blue ward over normal ward?
[3:30:00] nwa4lifeTV: i think its the scaling aspect as his skills change as he gains stacks
[3:30:14] WDZepplin: sadge
[3:31:00] Ab176: it's an extra long flank
[3:31:13] mocha_cs: you carry this on the bear
[3:31:18] dudebrobuild: why are playing a pdf champ
[3:31:49] stoicHolcan: +4
[3:31:55] HaloOfSpores: @dudebrobuild huh?
[3:32:25] keengolfer: @Santorin do you ever miss playing pro play ?
[3:33:16] getsometalentloser: ah the maw
[3:33:30] HellenWongFan: used to otp eve but games like this happen way too often
[3:33:37] trashpanda_oz: YESSIRRR
[3:34:09] stoicHolcan: do you live in canada now? :o
[3:34:16] Bazeloth: So she's in canada now permanently?
[3:34:59] keengolfer: are you in NA or EU ?
[3:35:01] dudebrobuild: the assasin experience
[3:35:02] stoicHolcan: nah this is eu lol
[3:35:35] stoicHolcan: hows your girlfriends danish?
[3:35:42] mocha_cs: i went into saint's stream the other day and was telling him how you loved him coaching you and when he would be straight forward and be like "hey you are are playing like shit" he thought it was hilarious and lovec ocaching
[3:35:44] keengolfer: do you ceep in tuch with any of the pro players from your former teams in the us ? :D
[3:36:20] alabamahammer02: tyler1LUL
[3:36:23] ChronicallyBlazed: main character syndrome is real
[3:36:55] alabamahammer02: @ChronicallyBlazed to be fair, all people are main characters in their own lives. why is that bad?
[3:37:11] Bodhipsyche: @alabamahammer02 Exactly
[3:37:12] Yoshimitzu91: What is the best jungler for the start in Your opinion?
[3:37:34] Bodhipsyche: @Bodhipsyche Dunno how people that say "amin character" dont understand that all sentients ARE the main character
[3:37:43] alabamahammer02: @Bodhipsyche based
[3:37:48] greggey: What do you think about Lillia + Briar for a jg champion pool? I've just started playing the role
[3:37:49] mr_sizzler007: can we see a reksai next @Santorin
[3:37:51] ChronicallyBlazed: @alabamahammer02 talking about a team game, not real life
[3:37:52] Yoshimitzu91: I like to play carry
[3:37:59] mr_sizzler007: peepoChat
[3:38:03] mocha_cs: @Santorin i went into saint's stream the other day and was telling him how you loved him coaching you and when he would be straight forward and be like "hey you are are playing like shit" he thought it was hilarious and loved coaching that team
[3:38:30] dudebrobuild: talon jg gaming
[3:38:50] mr_sizzler007: Concerned
[3:39:54] mocha_cs: the nerfs really hit lillia's WR
[3:40:38] mr_sizzler007: i wanna see the eternum skin yes !
[3:40:57] keengolfer: @Santorin  who is the best jg in EU pro play atm in your oppinion ?
[3:41:03] dudebrobuild: wholesome fat man needs a nerf
[3:41:16] Yoshimitzu91: If any of Your lane for example top is doing 0/5 till 7min of the game it is better to ler him be end try to feed mid or bot right?
[3:41:22] greggey: @Santorin Lillia has skewed winrate because she was 43% winrate early patch cause she was bugged
[3:41:23] dudebrobuild: sick of seeing him every game as top/mid/jg
[3:42:58] barnun1: do you think Elise is strong right now? love your insight!
[3:43:03] daemunblaze: @santorin you missed the funniest kill in pro league history
[3:43:06] Neaxz: Ervery style and every role
[3:43:09] Neaxz: ez
[3:43:17] mr_sizzler007: which is your fav reksai skin @Santorin
[3:43:30] aeroiswell: Anivia support mains unite
[3:43:48] stoicHolcan: i play video games so i can bully people without feeling like an asshole Kappa
[3:44:14] annehappy318: @Santorin can u build shojin pls
[3:44:53] everyman322: as usual, riot's patch notes logic is hilarious. they said sivir's attack range is too short, so they gave her 4 armor 🤔
[3:44:54] GettingBetterAtEverything: I play league for fun but I actually have little fun when i play poorly. Best time for me is when I can play the game and have a lot of impact, winning or losing doesnt matter
[3:45:13] slayji: evening mr panini
[3:45:55] greggey: So @Santorin if you would recommend a pairing for briar / lillia (1 for each) then who do you think fits that best
[3:46:01] TorqueBandit: i imagine those that don't take it very seriously stay in low ELO
[3:46:07] Nikolajnb: Any ingame settings there is must have?
[3:46:10] TorqueBandit: or rather don't rise to high elo
[3:46:41] keengolfer: some players has no chill XD
[3:46:48] GettingBetterAtEverything: @TorqueBandit exactly, I play league since the start (2010 i think? i played the beta) and never went above platinum LUL actually silver atm
[3:47:13] peonsrage: @everyman322 YEP makes sense to me
[3:47:54] TorqueBandit: whoa I didn't know that setting existed
[3:47:56] daemunblaze: @santorin do you watch LCK games?
[3:48:00] keengolfer: i am the worst kind of player XD just dying XD hard stuck in iron XD
[3:48:31] zyxere: as long as zeri doesnt run it down
[3:48:58] yelims100: Hows reksai w/ the buffs
[3:49:08] daemunblaze: @santorin you should watch the first game of NS and DK series.  Had the funniest death ever in it.
[3:49:28] dontcountonthewicked: sry you're not allowed to gank, farm only
[3:49:58] TorqueBandit: they got a ping like 5 minutes ago
[3:50:14] Baemare: oh man
[3:50:40] Bodhipsyche: You mean fight level 6 daisy
[3:50:40] TorqueBandit: @GettingBetterAtEverything hehe
[3:50:42] keengolfer: but you know they will blame you XD
[3:50:44] Tkochad: Eclipse feels so good rn on most AD junglers
[3:50:57] Tkochad: Especially like Xin/briar/J4
[3:51:33] keengolfer: in Gragas mind it is jg diff since irver is ganking XD
[3:51:39] mr_sizzler007: what u think about jarvan @Santorin
[3:51:41] daemunblaze: @santorin at least you didn't die to a gromp tower dive
[3:51:49] Ab176: I feel like zeri is not a scaling champ anymore
[3:52:26] angelopuza: he wants u to borrow in and die XD
[3:52:34] Bodhipsyche: @Ab176 What even the fk is Zeri tbh
[3:52:49] SilexFPS: well look at the guy's name lol
[3:52:56] Bodhipsyche: @Bodhipsyche cursed to never have identity
[3:53:00] keengolfer: if I where playing that i would e in and just die XD
[3:53:03] Dezrunner: Ayoooooo Mr. Nisse-gamer! how's your day man? Good mental? =)
[3:53:20] zyxere: get focused.i've had it happen to me and then I look back and my team is not even aware
[3:53:26] Ab176: idk zeri has a weirdly good lane phase and can get farm in normally dangerous phases
[3:53:38] Ab176: but if you look at her win rate by game length she falls off a cliff after only 20 mins
[3:53:42] Ab176: and wins really hard early
[3:54:09] Bodhipsyche: Yea shes such a weird champ, settled into a strange spot after the constant tampering she needed
[3:54:36] alanalda: :)
[3:54:42] brightdiscord: laugh and smile it off
[3:54:44] keengolfer: @Santorin that gragas is just this game has a huge jg diff XD
[3:54:47] zyxere: its funny to watch but it sucks cause it's your team
[3:55:27] zyxere: "getting weaksided again"
[3:55:36] Ab176: if jg ganks me = jg gap one way or another
[3:55:44] TorqueBandit: thats the role of jungler, tho, the scape goat
[3:55:56] SilexFPS: did they actually go through with the runaans buff for melee champs? if so, is it live? @Santorin
[3:56:06] CrimeSkeleton: I like stridebreaker on her currently
[3:56:09] Filius_Oblitus: Do you like hail of blades on her?
[3:57:09] Bodhipsyche: Best is when team picks nasus, viktor, smolder, hwei. Enemy laners are ganking you in your jungle all game. "Jungle diff"
[3:57:10] keengolfer: I like how you stoped doing a camp to play for your team
[3:57:11] zyxere: he came hard, let me get an "assist"
[3:57:16] greggey: I hope they don't try to push it through in the future
[3:57:32] betavojnikk: is pta maybe better than conq? @Santorin
[3:57:37] greggey: but I mean luckily they at least realized it's a huge mistake and didn't push it to live
[3:58:41] itzMCGang: why isnt darius played more in the jungle, what makes him bad there ?
[3:59:20] Ab176: what if darius went permanently invisible once he hit 6
[3:59:30] greggey: @Ab176 holy genius idea
[3:59:41] Bodhipsyche: @Ab176 Eveius
[3:59:44] everyman322: @itzMCGang also his ganks suck
[3:59:50] TorqueBandit: @Ab176 honestly surprised Riot hasn't done that yet
[4:00:05] everyman322: any champ that just has to run at you to gank you had better run really really fast
[4:00:08] peonsrage: @Ab176 didn't you read the patch notes? YEP
[4:00:09] bunses: nah my team would flame me if i dont go with them
[4:00:18] greggey: @everyman322 To be fair darius is fast as fuck
[4:00:19] stoicHolcan: does he get to regen to full hp as well?
[4:00:49] greggey: "I'm also smart" does 0 damage, burns flash, dies
[4:00:54] peonsrage: @stoicHolcan They decided on a Kled style HP bar for him now YEP
[4:01:05] 88Architects: hopefully KEKW
[4:01:06] Ab176: you need a restraining order on this gragas
[4:01:07] minnaismycat: rek has disgustingly low dmg after the rework
[4:01:08] 88Architects: waits til you die
[4:01:10] rexxarhero4: #bringback old eclipse FeelsBadMan
[4:01:16] zyxere: has victor ulted this game?
[4:01:34] everyman322: @greggey not really... not without items that give movespeed
[4:02:07] Peksensation: wouldn't titanic be better on reksai when going bruiser, you stack hp on her with shojin and steraks and you can auto reset ?
[4:02:16] greggey: Is it worth to smite cannon minions like that?
[4:02:21] orangetapwater: you muted her no?
[4:03:24] TorqueBandit: im so confused by that ping
[4:03:25] Zhaibot: sorry if i missed you answering this,is the W still buggy?As in if you auto it doesnt knock up as easy as pressing w
[4:03:35] Bulletoverload: @greggey if you're going to miss it otherwise, ya
[4:04:43] Bodhipsyche: Looking like rammus clearing that drag
[4:04:57] yelims100: Feel like reksai is just a walking knocj up
[4:05:07] annehappy318: @Santorin is shojin bad on reksai?
[4:05:30] Bodhipsyche: wp
[4:05:33] stoicHolcan: eclipse diff
[4:05:36] yelims100: Wp wp
[4:05:47] Amnehbae: LUL
[4:06:06] stoicHolcan: lol that was kinda cute
[4:06:10] yelims100: LOL
[4:06:17] SpottedGiraffes: chat I missed last 30 min. was eve game a w?
[4:06:22] greggey: ngl if the janna gets baron with that nado she deserves it
[4:06:41] zyxere: @SpottedGiraffes it was a loss
[4:06:43] everyman322: I'm sure he won't figure that out
[4:06:58] axcitarjr: oh no not this song BibleThump
[4:07:00] SpottedGiraffes: sad
[4:07:53] TorqueBandit: Gragas ended on a good note, great to see
[4:07:55] yelims100: Gragas redemption arc
[4:08:50] greggey: Could you try a Lillia game? I think it'd be very interesting to see you play her
[4:09:04] TorqueBandit: oh sweet, a Ford commercial, my favorite
[4:09:07] annehappy318: if cleaver shojin u can do better?
[4:09:21] greggey: Holy shit
[4:10:51] rexxarhero4: just play the better lilia, hecarim Pog
[4:11:01] Logizzle3: Bananas been op for like 20 patches man
[4:11:20] greggey: @Logizzle3 Surely they get nerfed next patch right?
[4:11:47] DuckieFried: love playing lilly so much fun
[4:11:47] ChronicallyBlazed: sliced bananas on cereal. goated
[4:11:53] Donawen: Jesus that's a lot of bananas
[4:12:01] mocha_cs: both not good though lets be real
[4:12:05] TorqueBandit: have you tried bananas with honey? crazy synergy
[4:12:06] mocha_cs: hec and lillia not in best spot haha
[4:12:09] greggey: Bro is the only guy to ever get radiation poisoning from eating bananas

[4:16:54] WhiteLift: What's your opinion on Zac jungle?
[4:16:55] yelims100: Imt gunna give u a call so they can lose their lcs spot
[4:17:17] greggey: Dude what's hapening
[4:17:17] late_ray777: people can still get chat restricted for typing in party chat even alone
[4:17:23] angelopuza: Cringe behavior KEKW
[4:17:25] TorqueBandit: was it worth it Udyr
[4:17:30] Logizzle3: Immaculate counterjungler
[4:17:31] Dezrunner: I dont care that you're relegation king, i've always enjoyed watching you, in games and on stream
[4:17:37] zyxere: he's in your head now
[4:17:56] angelopuza: I swear udyr and shaco players do that often as they can
[4:17:58] TorqueBandit: he didn't see udyr fighting you?...
[4:18:00] hazygreys: why are people playing trundle again, did he get buffs?
[4:18:02] TorqueBandit: or the vision ping?...
[4:18:03] Logizzle3: "as long as my trundle isnt an inter" famous last words
[4:18:08] yelims100: Bruh

[4:18:22] rexxarhero4: @TorqueBandit hence why its the worst elo in any server ever
[4:18:23] greggey: That trundle just got caught unaware
[4:18:31] yelims100: Insane trundle didnt even try to do anything

[4:20:51] yelims100: Recruit him for ur relegation squad
[4:20:55] greggey: Bro why is he playin like this
[4:20:59] TorqueBandit: probably blaming you in chat
[4:21:00] greggey: From lvl 1
[4:22:12] TorqueBandit: calculated
[4:22:48] yelims100: Yeh
[4:23:04] yelims100: Thought that was a tax, but ur bot basing
[4:23:35] greggey: Interacting with this guy at all is griefing your win chances no?
[4:25:58] WhiteLift: So is Lillia still a top 5 jungler?
[4:26:34] zyxere: udyr top again...
[4:27:06] zyxere: hes going to take ur top camps
[4:27:35] Logizzle3: Lillia is, in fact, a jungler of all time
[4:28:09] yelims100: Lmao
[4:28:36] peonsrage: Holding his ult for next game YEP
[4:28:37] zyxere: he was going to say "that was ll me"
[4:28:54] yelims100: His brain outsmarted u lol
[4:30:16] greggey: Man Lillia eats through mana like crazy
[4:31:07] SilexFPS: rip
[4:31:15] keengolfer: @Santorin did you ever play on a roster with DL ?
[4:32:23] zyxere: do you ever go comic drive with lilila
[4:33:32] KerrKo: zoomin
[4:33:40] greggey: Dude you're so clean with it though
[4:34:09] zyxere: he deserves the traffic cone/cop skin
[4:34:31] yelims100: Is W max always go to? E here might be good for poke
[4:35:10] angelopuza: Rylais on lilias seems broken
[4:35:13] greggey: @yelims100 W just does so much dmg, E is mainly for the slow + to get ult on them
[4:35:35] Swiftfool: He can just ult your ult?
[4:35:37] MCKo7: free double QSS for yone
[4:35:40] Swiftfool: thats CRINGE
[4:35:40] KerrKo: ff
[4:35:41] MCKo7: great design
[4:35:42] MCKo7: LOL
[4:35:58] aeroiswell: a wise man once said, Yone is definitely a ranged champion
[4:36:01] greggey: Tough game for the lillia :(
[4:36:02] Swiftfool: ohh it was his E
[4:36:25] keengolfer: is bjergsen still in  E sports ?
[4:36:25] Eknore: Except Yuumi, what are the worst champions for jungle?
[4:36:31] Bulletoverload: @keengolfer no
[4:36:32] MCKo7: seems melee lethal tempo needs to be gutted more
[4:36:59] yelims100: @greggey I get the W dmg, but seems itd be used sparingly bcuz insts
[4:36:59] apes_kingdom: i prefer playing against yone than fking udyr/jax
[4:37:13] yelims100: It's a death wish to go melee range
[4:37:20] yelims100: That game
[4:37:23] cjcunn506: can sona actually clear camps early?
[4:37:41] paradoxperspective: @santorin Reksai truly feels so much better now, you have Q so many times in any skirmish or prolonged fights. Looks like it’s gonna be meta?
[4:38:16] yelims100: Revert the ult nerf 75% dmg lost rip
[4:38:18] mitskin1: hows kindred rn ?
[4:38:45] Ingenuitee8: My favourite League word
[4:38:45] rexxarhero4: whats next champ?
[4:38:46] keengolfer: @Bulletoverload do you know what bjergsen is  doing now ?
[4:39:10] MCKo7: yes
[4:39:18] Arisutra: good afternoon!
[4:39:29] MCKo7: LOL
[4:39:29] Ab176: surely last season he just decayed right

[4:39:49] angelopuza: THE PHREAK SPECIAL OMEGALUL
[4:39:57] hazygreys: lmao over 200 of the tree and everything else down in double diggees
[4:40:01] JettBalasko: bel'veth enjoyer :)
[4:40:18] JettBalasko: i love bel'veth
[4:40:18] yelims100: Make roles have sep ranked as well rip
[4:40:19] Arisutra: if you use maokai support to climb, you're an evil person
[4:40:21] paradoxperspective: isn’t belveth turbo nerfed?
[4:40:24] rexxarhero4: the honest truth is also that most of the top players abuse meta for elo inflating @Santorin
[4:40:32] angelopuza: EGOISTO
[4:41:03] MCKo7: its like insider trading!
[4:41:25] MCKo7: yeah they should do hotfixes
[4:41:40] MCKo7: like if its very obvious just ship it
[4:41:43] rexxarhero4: TFT has hotfixes
[4:41:51] rexxarhero4: anything is turbo op they intsa nerf
[4:41:52] yelims100: Wouldve been hilarious if Licktroll was that maokai
[4:41:55] paradoxperspective: you mean like the coming smodler hotfix? I am sure it will fix the champ
[4:42:03] Arisutra: it's not even like maokai had a legendary or ultimate skin recently
[4:42:09] Arisutra: if he did, i'd kinda get it
[4:42:41] Ab176: I wish riot would execute mages bot lane
[4:42:46] keengolfer: what is the to broken champ in jg ?
[4:42:53] MCKo7: if u dont take it it gets taken!
[4:43:10] enreves: Kayn was elo inflated formonths
[4:43:22] keengolfer: @Santorin what do you think about brior ?
[4:43:23] zyxere: fiddlesticks in low elo?
[4:43:33] MCKo7: do you think voli is better top or jungle right now?
[4:44:54] Arisutra: to be fair, winrate isn't always a sign of how broken something is
[4:46:18] Arisutra: taric is the highest winrate supp atm (depending on sample size) but he's not broken
[4:46:37] paradoxperspective: @santorin Oner said it like 3 times in his stream the other day. first 5 mins of the game kills should go to jungler for snowball
[4:46:41] xyoubax: what should i do to get out from emerlad as jg
[4:47:09] keengolfer: @Santorin if you knew he started your blue sid would you just take his blue side ?
[4:48:03] uTilgjengelig: Is katarina worth to play in this elo FishMoley ?

[5:03:36] MarioMayhem: HeadBang
[5:04:01] macywaky: @Santorin are u going terminus next?
[5:04:16] zyxere: what do you think sum spell snowball(mark) on this map?
[5:04:19] Ab176: your e didnt get to reduce any damage either
[5:04:26] Sylvain269: You need survivability in my opinion
[5:04:31] Sylvain269: Anything with health
[5:04:35] macywaky: terminus feels very goof this patch
[5:04:40] Sylvain269: Or Death's Dance
[5:04:52] Sylvain269: Stridebreaker and Kraken is plenty of damage
[5:05:13] macywaky: tbf my build is kraken -> terminus usually then tank

[5:06:24] macywaky: steraks here seems very good
[5:06:40] Sylvain269: @macywaky That was my thought
[5:07:00] macywaky: like steraks into unending despair or something
[5:07:05] macywaky: seems pretty ideal
[5:07:09] Sylvain269: Ah you lost me
[5:07:18] Sylvain269: If you want MR build Wit's End
[5:07:50] keengolfer: omg the int XD
[5:07:55] macywaky: u can but i enjoy keinic over wits just because its better as a survivablity item
[5:07:58] macywaky: Keinic
[5:08:03] macywaky: is good if u need
[5:08:04] moonholiday: i always struggle keeping my lead with Belveth as the game goes later
[5:08:20] DuckieFried: frozen heart not worth anymore with the nerf?
[5:08:26] macywaky: @moonholiday kinda wierd cuz she is a scaling champ xD
[5:08:46] moonholiday: @macywaky exactly
[5:08:47] macywaky: @DuckieFried depends, on belveth always no cuz u dont have mana but its still pretty good
[5:09:21] binultwitch: where did kayle go LUL
[5:09:28] macywaky: @moonholiday i build kraken into tank, with terminus second if i have to carry. helps me live later with lead cuz kraken in honestly all the damage u need
[5:09:34] DuckieFried: OH true true i was thinkin about frozen heart as armor item my b
[5:09:37] Sylvain269: Not going to lie, Katarina needs to stop taking the kills
[5:09:54] Sylvain269: I mean it doesn't matter now
[5:10:15] Sylvain269: GGWP
[5:11:32] macywaky: ult
[5:11:36] macywaky: and eclipse
[5:11:38] macywaky: both
[5:11:42] macywaky: ult gives sheild
[5:13:10] macywaky: belveth
[5:13:11] greggey: Since you don't think Lillia is a good pairing for Briar, which champion do you think is?
[5:13:23] greggey: Briar being the primary and then the other champ being secondary
[5:13:28] stoicHolcan: smolder voli sera vayne mhm
[5:13:30] zyxere: one of your clicks didnt go trhoguh can we check runes again
[5:13:34] greggey: I really like Briar :)
[5:13:36] macywaky: viego, belveth
[5:13:38] zyxere: warwick

[5:14:11] nightwingx_88: nocturne ?
[5:14:14] Kimakaze: WW
[5:14:18] Kimakaze: Warwick
[5:14:27] zyxere: can we check runes i thought you misclicked
[5:14:33] macywaky: @moonholiday neice tbf but since I build tanky, build hp and am in the middle of everyone, the heal is usefull
[5:14:38] stoicHolcan: play lillia, her kit is unique enough that when items favour her again she will shoot back up the meta ladder
[5:14:38] zyxere: u did it
[5:14:45] stoicHolcan: and then youll be good at her and climb
[5:14:45] DuckieFried: Vi reminds me alot of briars kit
[5:14:47] macywaky: @macywaky cuz u heal like 200 hp a proc or smthn
[5:15:00] macywaky: atleast
[5:15:09] zyxere: thats like a japanese character
[5:15:12] macywaky: thats a japenese alphabet
[5:15:19] macywaky: for K i think
[5:15:25] greggey: it might sind kinda cringe but I just like how the characters feel, briar gives you that feeling of being a feral murder machine and lillia makes you feel like a carefree dancer
[5:15:50] ch3m15try: plot twist varus top
[5:15:55] macywaky: Briar is the modern warwick
[5:16:15] zyxere: warwick's blood hunt makes u a  physchopath running down ppl
[5:16:17] MCKo7: what are the 1v9 junglers in your opinion?
[5:16:18] tuniis: captain volibear bestt
[5:16:28] mikefromrematch: lillia is the only champ with a 9 man sleep
[5:16:44] macywaky: @MCKo7 sclaing ones - viego, bel, stuff like that

[5:32:21] jooshboxes: @dkvukster I can understand that it just looks like this Gragas is lost and could use some directions. but I get that backseat gaming is super annoying
[5:33:10] dkvukster: @jooshboxes yea thats what i mean :) and we all know the league community sometimes.. he might just start doing the opposite xD
