[1:54:18] Jaketin8: Riot matchmaking is literally way too borderlining rigged, like its reaching point of where it cant be argued if its rigging games or not, like some games are just painfully obvious that they are just rigged againts or for you, slapping you into game with bunch of tilted loss streakers againts bunch of smurfs, oh yeah, clearly not rigged match

[1:56:09] MrCM: wooo, and now i win one, in an absolute stomp, and got a bunch of honors from mates - this game is so weird
[1:56:09] Jaketin8: @SpiderSleeping Yep, they know league community is fed up with them, so instead of trying to fix that, they have just switched to milk as much money as possible before the community says "fck this" and leaves
[1:56:25] Phieldworker: just got my dose of split push baby rage quitting top. hopefully that was my quota for the day
[1:56:52] mistermurr: It's so unfair that you lose more lp than you gain
[1:56:58] Am_I_Adam: have you listened to the dune part 2 sound track?
[1:57:26] Martybggg: @S17Master Noone plays that champ mid, at least in my games, you can see varus mid sometimes but it's rare, imo
[1:57:31] SpiderSleeping: who is KayPeas mid ban
[1:57:37] MrCM: i got a top yi vs sion, who was 30 cs at 12 minutes, and 3 levels lower than his lane opponent, and an amumu that started drake with no smite, and no prio - i think i had it worst today

[3:57:07] Deveix: I need some advice. How do I convince my friend to just stop playing ranked games, when they keep going on a massive loosing streak? They get so eager to win to the point where they don't stop until they return to LP starting point. And then I have to hear them get depressed over bad teammates, when they have the option to just try another day HahaSweat

[4:00:29] lilCACTUSS9: I think a better comparison would be Backseating is like that smartass kid who answers the question without raising their hand. Discouraging others and taking the opportunity from them to get a good mark or to prove they know it too. @KayPea
[4:00:41] Deveix: @alexandra_h_p Thank you! If they don't start considering, i might have to start giving them a silent treatment so they eventually get the point LuL
