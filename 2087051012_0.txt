[8:54:29] MpraWins: viper do you lock the camera or are you just holding space?
[8:54:36] PsychopathicTop: yea esp if u play melee
[8:54:49] YEEtora: Does anyone ever hold down space to recenter/soft lock instead of locking?
[8:54:56] eavlol: it's less important for enchanters tho
[8:55:01] PsychopathicTop: i think control mage players should always play unlocked
[8:55:04] PsychopathicTop: or get used to it at least
[8:55:08] eavlol: good <3
[8:55:08] Hello_im_Riven: wutup
[8:55:10] LordNebse: but isnt it harder for your brain to process your own movement into your enemies movement? since youre doing so much micro movement youre not doing all of it actively, my question might seem troll, but im master and i came to the conclusion to never lock camera xD
[8:55:13] PsychopathicTop: like i watch cupic/dun i think they are 95% + unlocked

[8:57:01] phamezan: what happened to the no riven to challenger is it completed?
[8:57:08] Aabris: @lordnebse The whole human race would have went extinct if our brains couldn't calculate those movements.
