[0:16:06] kenommi: True, I think Aatrox's W is the most useless ability in the game.
[0:16:24] Trevichko11: its how u do the combo
[0:16:34] veigarbotline: Riot and their balance changes
[0:16:39] alext6665: Or lower the CD and accelerate the pulling timer
[0:16:39] elephantworld: Make it a simple stun like Viego W
[0:16:43] emanor18: What would you want in W, CC, damage or what
[0:16:49] BIG_FLACKO_: Makes the combo easier? i like the W
[0:17:04] Trevichko11: Think of all teh times your w pulled when its wasnt supposed to

[0:44:02] NecroticOrkun: W could be a slow spell but make a point and click spell like garen q. When you are near the enemy you hit first q then press w named battlecry (this will slow the people near aatrox) then press 2nd q and 3rd q. I think thats more interesting.

[3:31:46] cullinggameshibuyaarc: it doesnt
[3:31:47] HajjRogerinho: it does not
[3:31:56] KapitanTPS: Randuins reduces crit damage by 20% and total AD by 10% but Aatrox Q is a cosmetic crit (like Mordes isolated Q for example) so only the AD reduction affects Aatrox Q
[3:32:02] emanor18: if randuin reduces so infinity edge should increase

[3:32:10] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/

[4:57:48] ChosenOneTTV: Hey Riot can we fix Senna by making it so she doesnt have a passive Crit chance? no? ok... Can we nerf her range so melee champions cant hit her? No? ok... Can we nerf her mana so she cannot spam abilities without any Mana items? no? Ok..

[5:00:23] yungdrakeo: @kawaiionichan r6 is more game sense/map knowledge
[5:00:32] kawaiionichan: @Naayil that's not an adc issue, that's just senna being broken (and smolder)

[5:00:42] EccY03: Hey Naayil have you ever been interested in competitive?

[5:34:34] rionagh07: you have to go spam
[5:34:35] snadizzzs: If everyone can report the stream to get it temporarily disabled. this is probably the best course of action atm. Report and use "Search" then find "Cyber Attack" You can write a little message too if you feel the need.  Alois_NL has been compromised. This isn't Alois_NL, someone is using his stream to scam. Please disable temporarily for safety.
[5:34:36] atlwws: spam scams or bot ?
[5:34:40] ShuIkin: isnt it stupid af to stream on someones account? cant twitch just detect who's streaming?
