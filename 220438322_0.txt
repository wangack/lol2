[3:46:16] colearning: honestly idek, he just takes it for the 25% reduced summoner CD I guess
[3:46:50] colearning: funny thing is the mastery is pretty much useless without the CDR, considering the CDR is just a passive part of it haha

[3:46:58] colearning: TTours
[3:47:25] colearning: yeah fleet footwork sounds better or idk literally any offensive keystone haha
[3:47:30] ZelgiusZero: They take it to swap to teleport to force the enemy to have a bad back early on but to take a mastery for 1 specific thing seems kinda bad

[5:18:19] cantspeel: this match broadcasted at the same time as RW vs IG. We decided to broadcast the IG game.
[5:18:31] cantspeel: however the quick 2-0 allowed us to jump into game 3 of LGD at their home stadium
[5:18:42] 인테르나시오날레: ty
[5:18:50] SkieFliesaway: which games are same time next saturday and which are you picking? :P

[5:19:17] Optyfenx: @cantspeel will that be the same case every week, that 2 matches get played at the same time?
[5:19:22] thaonliwun: @velocegravity were the first 2 matches broadcasted on another platform
[5:19:33] 인테르나시오날레: Jinoo..

[5:19:54] Nesbyy: :(
[5:19:54] velocegravity: its actually pretty sick that the teams have their own stadiums in china
[5:19:54] thaonliwun: @cantspeel were the first two matches broadcasted on another platform
[5:19:59] cantspeel: This does not happen every week, only once in a while
[5:20:08] im_moyo: @Nesbyy i doubt anyone wants him anymore lol
[5:20:15] cantspeel: they were on douyu and huya

[5:20:56] SkieFliesaway: what browser would you recommend for chinese sites?
[5:21:00] cantspeel: how do you guys feel about us bringing the extra bonus match?
[5:21:04] Sjol: @Nesbyy Half of the korean league went to China that year though, he just fell off too much to return to LCK
[5:21:09] im_moyo: @cantspeel SeemsGood
[5:21:18] bigface128: more LPL is always welcome :D
[5:21:22] Nesbyy: ye thats sad
[5:21:28] velocegravity: @cantspeel how could we feel bad about a bonus game?
[5:21:34] Sjol: More matches is always fun

[5:23:24] Sjol: GG
[5:23:25] bloatyy: What happened to RW vs IG?
[5:23:30] velocegravity: dont know i doubt its is available that easy
[5:23:33] bigface128: 2-0 iG
[5:23:35] Sjol: IG smashed 2-0
[5:23:38] im_moyo: LGD have the sickest stadium, but the worst team FeelsBadMan
[5:23:54] obamoose: where's imp?
[5:23:55] carlsz: actually feel bad for imp
[5:24:03] im_moyo: how can you feel bad for imp
[5:24:07] bloatyy: IMP himself said he's not that good anymore
[5:24:09] im_moyo: he doesnt even play well anymore
[5:24:13] bigface128: why? he lives the skrilla life now
[5:24:18] im_moyo: he should get replaced lol
[5:24:25] thaonliwun: Mmmm doritos
[5:24:25] im_moyo: i feel bad for his teammates
[5:24:27] velocegravity: last summer he played pretty good tbh
[5:24:39] carlsz: He was so good tho
[5:24:55] leapinc66: why is no one interested in LPL?
[5:24:56] Sjol: 3 years ago? Times change mate
[5:24:56] bloatyy: He's not horrible but he is not even close to his 2014 form or even 2015
[5:24:57] DollarSVK: black Mouth :D
[5:25:06] world303: Raz TriHard
[5:25:08] velocegravity: ofc
[5:25:19] bloatyy: LPL doesn't market itself to western audience, it focuses on it's Chinese fans
[5:25:20] im_moyo: i mean he's kinda horrible considering he's an import in LPL
[5:25:22] thaonliwun: Least Lgd got 1 1 Kappa contention Kappa
[5:25:39] bigface128: not watching LPL for the Raz DansGame
[5:25:45] leapinc66: @bloatyy yea I know the market in LOL is insanely huge
[5:25:47] Sjol: @im_moyo He's decent, but that's it
[5:25:55] leapinc66: @bloatyy I mean in China
[5:25:58] bigface128: Raz at worlds never feelsbadman
[5:26:02] im_moyo: he's one of the worse adcs in LPL imo
[5:26:16] SkieFliesaway: @cantspeel did frosk make any predictions about LDG this year? :P
[5:26:27] SkieFliesaway: LGD*
[5:26:57] velocegravity: skt benching untara for a rookie instead of bringing wolf back to supp
[5:26:58] leapinc66: but its just awkward that so few ppl watch LPL outside China when they constantly have over a million viewers in China
[5:27:23] velocegravity: 2 games and not a single gank by wolf pre 15min.
[5:27:33] bigface128: ppl watch lck instead I guess?
[5:27:46] BaldursDottir: can't wait for BLG game
[5:27:55] velocegravity: 0 pressure on any lane
[5:27:59] 秋天的太陽: 3 games live tomorrow
