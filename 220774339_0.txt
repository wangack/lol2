[4:42:27] the4thsurvivorr: aftershock is so busted are you joking lol
[4:42:34] the4thsurvivorr: aftershock supports out damage their own adc
[4:42:46] the4thsurvivorr: and thats at like level 3
[4:42:49] ZelgiusZero: nobody takes aftershock anymore
[4:42:50] GummiGrim: @the4thsurvivorr That's getting changes next patch, less damage I believe with more scaling
[4:42:52] M4RC0TH3PH03NIX: hope riot hires hashinshin so jax can literally be god
[4:42:57] ZelgiusZero: it's all about the unsealed spellbook now

[4:43:16] GummiGrim: I mean it could be a solo queue problem @ZelgiusZero
[4:43:24] weebonduty: because inspiration runes give more bonus stats

[4:43:27] FroggyMcFrogsen: @ZelgiusZero in Solo/Duo, you can pick aftershock easily, its used in challenger tier too.
[4:43:29] GummiGrim: Unsealed Spellbook is kind of busted though, the CDR alone makes it worth it

[4:44:20] Gary_Werbenjagermanjensen: top lane is fucking boring now just farming
[4:44:21] GummiGrim: @Frankkintama Ah, double checked for myself, the extra bonus stats aren't that much
[4:44:25] aatroxs_last_dance: @Professor_Cal you would be psycho if you played off meta in high elo
[4:44:35] GummiGrim: @Frankkintama At least in comparison to choosing the standard tree. They did nerf the stat bonus in general
[4:44:35] TruthInArgument: Jax is off meta?
[4:44:42] ZelgiusZero: They actually nerfed the aftershock damage early on by a lot
[4:44:51] ZelgiusZero: But gave it AD/AP scaling to compensate
[4:44:55] weebonduty: 20% elixir + a little bonus, that is good for early game
[4:44:57] GummiGrim: @Professor_Cal Yes-ish. He was picked in LCK I think, but he's played full tank
[4:45:13] the4thsurvivorr: aftershock is going to be stronger on 8.2 NotLikeThis

[4:45:26] AI_Logic: I heard lux is a slightly worse version of zoe, why not pick her if zoe is banned Kappa
[4:45:29] TruthInArgument: Not in solo q. Top 5 picked top lane champs last 3 patches. Hash goes Korean build - Tiamat, triforce, titanic

[7:26:17] RustyTheCaster: Akali actually does counter him yes
[7:26:17] Mrdka_Na_Teplakach: ADC Skarner pls
[7:26:26] bloatyy: In compettiive yeah, GP is busted. In solo Q it's kinda easy to counter him with stuff like Akali, Kled, Gnar
[7:26:30] RustyTheCaster: Klepto changed his income and he's super strong with items
[7:26:30] kiyosi_ito: s
[7:26:34] RustyTheCaster: you could number tweak GP

[7:27:31] DaShiFtYoNe: her shrouds become more useless over time
[7:27:31] GenuineLGN: i feel like if you changed gp, becuase part of the reason hes so powerfull is klepto, if you didnt go klepto he would be useless, and then if klepto gets nerfed he would be even more useless
[7:27:37] RustyTheCaster: @thaonliwun I don't want to spoil the set for you but it was a very good set
