[4:01:02] Mechafanboy: True, it the tp didn't come in, it would've been a pretty decent call. Though I'd point out that JDG has two wards back there, i.e I think they were waiting for another fast dragon.
[4:01:04] merthins: TSM lost the split with Yellowstar, what are you talking about? Lost to CLG in the final
[4:01:11] HUUUUURZ: hauntzer was good at worlds
[4:01:11] aeztyr: Get 2 kills, loses every objective.
[4:01:18] im_moyo: why are people flaming individual players on tsm
[4:01:24] denoobiest: @Worldie no paid by regi FeelsBadMan
[4:01:25] im_moyo: they just had no teamplay
[4:01:36] flaava: well with shyl ur suppose to get obj he sucks late game and in team fights
[4:01:37] im_moyo: no one played that bad, they just didnt do anything
[4:01:38] Worldie: @im_moyo indeed, Bjergsen's wards were not in good position Kappa
[4:01:38] HUUUUURZ: is was like the best player from tsm
[4:01:39] xiaomingxiaohan: whos gonna win this game?
[4:01:43] denoobiest: because they're all playing like ass @im_moyo no communication makes everyone look horrendous
[4:01:53] denoobiest: hauntzer jayce NotLikeThis
[4:01:58] xiaomingxiaohan: guys whos gonna win game 1?
[4:02:01] Worldie: @flaava what you talk about, shyvana is a late game monster, it's early game that she sucks ü§î
[4:02:03] denoobiest: idk how he always manages to play so ass on jayce on stage
[4:02:07] Kelbotay: jing dong PogChamp
[4:02:10] im_moyo: they aren't playing bad individually for the most part at all
[4:02:11] Quellisonde: after listening to svenskeren about the team environment differences in TSM and C9, it really sounds like TSM is hard on its players and maybe not so conducive to growth.
[4:02:13] denoobiest: LUL
[4:02:15] im_moyo: they just dont have a gameplan
[4:02:17] Type_LUL_If_Trick_Dies: Bjerg and his moblie wards LUL

[4:02:20] lul4headxd: oh a 'top tier' team lost? must be communication issue 4Head
[4:02:21] AbcxYDE: I think TSM gets too much criticism, by the end of the split I think they can be the 8th best team
[4:02:21] aeztyr: @im_moyo look, good are those who actually did something. People are not flaming TSM. TSM team said they were prepared to get 1st place. They are pretentious.

[4:02:28] someone_with_an_apple: buff caitlyn she's bad

[4:02:42] im_moyo: its been 2 games lol
[4:02:47] Worldie: @Quellisonde the memes about "bjergsen and 4 wards" have a lot to do with TSM staff basically making players be that afaik
[4:02:47] Mechafanboy: I guess Kassawin is the soft counter LuL
[4:02:51] TzT0kJad: good, fuck Malzahar
[4:02:55] HUUUUURZ: winning na means nothing when u suck at every internatinal tournament

[4:03:08] Mechafanboy: Can't even be PJSalt for Malzahar. Yep fuck em xD
[4:03:12] denoobiest: means more than losing NA and not making international tournaments @hurzinator

[4:03:22] denoobiest: TOP

[4:03:24] Worldie: @denoobiest the "teenage faker" meme from the production was awesome LUL also managed to lose on Zoe, that takes skill
[4:03:25] HUUUUURZ: sure
[4:03:32] BettingDegen: TFW Echo Fox is the best team in your region FeelsBadMan
[4:03:33] Mechafanboy: If we knew who was gonna win, we wouldn't be watching LuL
[4:03:33] SugoiSenator: tsm looks like a 9th place team right now but I'm pretty sure they have the staff and players to turn it around
[4:03:34] HUUUUURZ: but atleast c9 perform a bit at worlds
[4:03:46] Worldie: ALL THE STOPWATCHES
[4:03:47] Quellisonde: I wonder how embarrased the team owner was he rented that lamborghini

[4:06:35] Kelbotay: @Quellisonde C9 won their games LUL
[4:06:38] aeztyr: @denoobiest they are nothing, they want to say they‚Äôre the best of the world. Look their twitters before and during Worlds.
[4:06:39] im_moyo: people dont draft caitlyn for lane right now, its more for her traps
[4:06:40] SugoiSenator: sven is on c9
[4:06:41] Bertenlol: @Quellisonde svenskeren was 2 - 0 on c9
[4:06:44] Worldie: @toi3uon no vision on enemies, pmuch
[4:06:46] Bertenlol: LUL
[4:06:48] im_moyo: she doesnt bully lane right now that hard
[4:06:56] Worldie: Cait is pretty bad right now, they only draft Cait when there's no other options
[4:07:02] im_moyo: cait isnt bad
[4:07:03] yudai95: @Quellisonde it does, EU players are trash if NA stopped importing them and starting getting players from their own server we could be as strong ask orea right now, but EU are pulling us back
[4:07:05] denoobiest: Well TSM might suck but at least I had fun watching the vikings today FeelsBadMan
[4:07:06] Quellisonde: yeah I was damn sure the casters did not power rank C9 correctly, lol
[4:07:09] Worldie: Overheal build basically makes her lane dominance irrelevant
[4:07:12] themageman1: orn dmg wtf
[4:07:13] ayasai: Fed Kassadin. gg
[4:07:15] Worldie: because enemy just outheals the poke

[4:07:18] elcab0ng: perfect game BibleThump
[4:07:18] im_moyo: Her traps are why you draft her
[4:07:20] GetToTheLantern: LUL LUL LUL
[4:07:23] Mechafanboy: At least they got a kill.....
[4:07:25] Quellisonde: CLG really did not do as well as expected either
[4:07:26] GetToTheLantern: Three part failure
[4:07:26] hnbl10: @im_moyo I know but she should still win this lane and she did
[4:07:27] Mechafanboy: that's wroth it right...? :P
[4:07:34] FantasticTT: 1 Kill PogChamp comeback
[4:07:34] aeztyr: Cait isn‚Äôt bad, the players are not good on hear. We‚Äôve already see some game she performing very well.
[4:07:36] im_moyo: Her traps are disgusting in pro play
[4:07:37] Not_JOMADA: Zoom going zoom zoom
[4:07:51] Worldie: The traps that last 30 seconds have almost nothing good for proplay :|
[4:07:54] titanmaster4: @quellisonde you expected clg to do well?
[4:07:54] BettingDegen: Cait is the strongest ADC late game right now lmao
[4:08:07] hnbl10: TOP is just a worst team in LPL right now
[4:08:08] TzT0kJad: Caitlyn MJL
[4:08:09] aeztyr: @quellisonde was expected to CLG doing well? Without aphromoo?
[4:08:10] Worldie: @Hnbl10 you don't really "win" a lane against taric / varus with double relic. They outsustain everything
[4:08:10] FantasticTT: I thought it's Sivir? Kappa
[4:08:11] ayasai: CN GP LUL
[4:08:12] Beetrayn: Kappa

[4:08:14] GetToTheLantern: @please_dont_spam_kappa Kog? Trist? wut
[4:08:18] Worldie: Caitlyn "best late game" LUL in bronze maybe
[4:08:19] Jeerna: cait strongest AD late game xDDDD bronze 5 confirmed
[4:08:22] im_moyo: A trap line is incredibly valuable in pro play
[4:08:24] BettingDegen: Kog late game in 2018 LUL
[4:08:28] Vatiar: cait is the strongest 6 item character in the entire game, games are going 50 mins rn
[4:08:31] TzT0kJad: Cait absolute garbage
[4:08:31] Excomm: Sivir
[4:08:36] Not_JOMADA: OH NO BARON WATCHOUT MonkaS
[4:08:36] Mechafanboy: I think Cait's problem is too much sustain for ADCs right now. Hard for her to completely bully someone out, and winning lane really doesn't matter if the other side scales better whereas Cait goes through a long lull.
[4:08:38] im_moyo: yeah Cait lategame is insane
[4:08:42] Not_JOMADA: monkaS *
[4:08:46] Arkn23: how about bjerg? discuss.
[4:08:46] Quellisonde: But EchoFox when they stripped the whole team and started with 5 new players, I was wondering what in the world are they doing...but apparently whoever made those decisions knew what they were doing, they looked great.
[4:08:48] im_moyo: watch Teddy's cait game vs SKT
[4:08:51] yudai95: why isnt miss fortune played anymore?
[4:08:56] 23cmtruedmage: Woow lol discussion
[4:08:58] TzT0kJad: caits late is shit compared to trist
[4:08:58] aeztyr: @worldie well, we already had games in LPL and LCK where Cait win. Watch the games.
[4:08:58] Unnicknamed2: cait sucks, morde best adc SwiftRage
[4:09:03] Worldie: @Mechafanboy it's both too much sustain in lane, and the fact her midgame is crap and lategame the hypercarryes just do much more
[4:09:05] 101shiki: When was MF ever played? lol
[4:09:07] Fearofgodsupreme: LUL
[4:09:10] BettingDegen: Go watch LCK where Teddy carried with Cait vs Sivir LUL
[4:09:11] jackie036: LUL
[4:09:13] titanmaster4: cait has t2 late game
[4:09:14] im_moyo: Cait is a hypercarry
[4:09:15] SugoiSenator: clg's roster looks good on paper but losing one of na's most stored players and shotcallers looks like it might hurt them early on
[4:09:16] Mechafanboy: Pretty much.
[4:09:19] Worldie: @aeztyr just because she wins doens't mean she's good. Zoe lost 2 games, that doesnt make Zoe not broken af LUL

[4:09:37] keveszm: trkCreep BALD BROS UNITE
[4:09:39] Jeerna: Bronze NA's = Cait best lategame lmao, do u even know numbers?? cait worst base attack speed ever
[4:09:39] yudai95: MF was 100% pick banned at all stars last year bro @101shiki
[4:09:44] Mechafanboy: MF is a lane bully and uh... does any adc really lane bully atm?
[4:09:47] Quellisonde: I dunno heard talk about carries vs poke and it not being a poke meta right now
[4:09:48] Worldie: @Quellisonde Cait is a lane bully with decent lategame, pmuch.
[4:09:51] titanmaster4: dead game
[4:09:51] HUUUUURZ: lethality nerf

[4:10:32] Not_JOMADA: Malz already has ult again LUL
[4:10:34] Quellisonde: only trouble with mid to late gamers is getting there, you take a fast game like TL vs TSM and your screwed, was a lot of fast games during worlds
[4:10:37] yudai95: imo NA jsut needs to stop importing EU players, EU players are straight up bad
[4:10:37] im_moyo: Trist and Vayne aren't as good as Twitch
[4:10:37] SugoiSenator: sivir's a really great late game carry right now
[4:10:47] hnbl10: @xiaomingxiaohan I don't think so, they are weak team with bad macro
[4:10:48] TzT0kJad: Cait good late game LUL NA bronze btw :4Head:
[4:10:48] Worldie: @101shiki MF adc was actually top tier for a couple weeks, until the overheal build come in and all her lane dominance meant nothing
[4:10:55] Avadon7: @xiaomingxiaohan no
[4:10:55] aeztyr: @worldie and you should have more facts and not supposing what is good or not haha :)

[4:33:30] Arkn23: tsm and clean gameplay. wow. thats new.
[4:33:33] dubaRA7: i wonder why tsm picked mike instead of xmithie..
[4:33:51] yudai95: isnt xmithie an import?
[4:33:51] bariey: bjergsen cant carry every game
[4:33:58] michaelsund: @dubara7 because thats what fans wanted ofc
[4:33:59] Quellisonde: its the hype man all the hype was on Mike Yeung
[4:34:01] bariey: with this new teamcomp
[4:34:03] ADominatus: they obviously had tryouts and mike did best
[4:34:12] Quellisonde: so TSM thought they were snapping up the best
[4:34:14] ADominatus: they dont just pick somone
[4:34:15] denoobiest: at least if tsm doesn't make the finals we have new EU players to blame 4Head
[4:34:15] dubaRA7: i dont think so, he is in the NA for years, he got the residency
[4:34:27] mujarshad: @yudai95 where would xmithie be an import from
[4:34:29] Quellisonde: the caster hype screws up a lot of things
[4:34:29] ichrasieremaeuse: if mike doesnt pick nida, they wont go to the worlds
[4:34:35] ADominatus: yea xmithie is not an import
[4:34:40] Quellisonde: like the overhype on doublelift last year
[4:34:41] denoobiest: xmithie is from na lol
[4:34:47] yudai95: problem is that new botlane is doing pretty well, they were winning lane vs TL and destroyed lane vs fly quest @denoobiest
[4:34:55] yudai95: @denoobiest so they clearly arent the problem
[4:34:57] Menmafuyu: mikeyoung is quite shit to be honest
[4:35:03] ga2006187329: EU>NA LUL
[4:35:07] bariey: but they only did well In lanee
[4:35:13] ADominatus: jeez dont start hating on the dude
[4:35:14] yudai95: @mujarshad isnt he an improt from philipines or something like that?
[4:35:16] mujarshad: @yudai95 the bot lane is the reason tl dumpstered tl wtf....
[4:35:17] denoobiest: oh i know i'm just being an na flamer @yudai95
[4:35:18] Quellisonde: is there any player who comes across more smarmy than doublelift in interviews
[4:35:19] HUUUUURZ: sucks that you still need to use 2 na players LUL
[4:35:19] ADominatus: its not like he played that bad
[4:35:25] michaelsund: Hes filipino yes
[4:35:28] merthins: Mike Yeung is budget sven, everyone know it was a horrible trade.
[4:35:29] bariey: ven + mithy got shit stomped and caught out everywhere else
[4:35:31] mujarshad: no, he's NA native
[4:35:31] dubaRA7: they just lost as a team, they didnt mesh

[4:36:02] ga2006187329: TL going to world this year
[4:36:03] mujarshad: @yudai95 they got jumped because mithy made zven waste kallista ult
[4:36:05] bariey: sven was literally the anchor holding TSM back LUL

[4:37:30] ichrasieremaeuse: thewy got killed 4v2 for a reason
[4:37:40] Quellisonde: just wanted to wipe the smirk off his face
[4:37:42] yudai95: @mujarshad zven and mithy made double lift and olleh use multiple summoenrs by themselfs but never got explotied
[4:37:45] Christodoulopoulos: VoHiYo
[4:37:45] bariey: mike isn't synergizing well with bjergerking
[4:37:45] denoobiest: why do our junglers stop ganking NotLikeThis
[4:37:49] yudai95: @mujarshad they didnt get jumped 4v2 for it
[4:37:51] ichrasieremaeuse: they just wasted a ult for a safe, 2 mins after that u get 4v2ed OFC
[4:37:54] ga2006187329: Who is Ovilee?
[4:38:03] ga2006187329: NALCS NEW CASTER?
[4:38:06] mujarshad: @yudai95 i didn't say they were awful, you said you can't blame the bot lane, i'm saying that tl game was their fault

[4:38:13] ga2006187329: On
[4:38:16] Quellisonde: used to work with Travis Gafford methinks
[4:38:21] ga2006187329: Ok got it
[4:38:25] bariey: sven + mithy only WENT EVEN with double n olleh
[4:38:26] yudai95: @bariey yeah TSM arent doing any team plays
[4:38:26] Quellisonde: shes legit, pretty good
[4:38:26] merthins: TSM's problem was the inconsistency of their botlane at international events, and their toplaners ability to 1v1. Now they just moved the problem to jgl.
[4:38:28] denoobiest: ovilee worked for yahoo esports before, was travis' prodigee
[4:38:33] bariey: u cant go even ur supposed to stomp
