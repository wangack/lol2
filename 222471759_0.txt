[3:57:33] botony7: edg win?
[3:57:35] Dagobert2424: we
[3:57:47] michaelsund: @hnbl10 I think Eu needs time to reform strong rosters. There are strong players still out of lcs BigBrother
[3:57:51] bloatyy: EDG 2-0 , WE 1-0
[3:57:59] botony7: ty
[3:58:16] biteSMS: IG is the most overrated LPL team
[3:58:25] 1kenn1: NA atm has too many experience players
[3:58:28] mujarshad: how are they overrated?
[3:58:31] 1kenn1: EU full of unproven rookies
[3:58:37] AbcxYDE: I think iG is going to take a long time to ramp up, but that they will be top 3 by the end of summer
[3:58:42] hnbl10: @GiorgioMastrota_ not with Bo1, you can have the best players in a world and with this format they will struggle against Bo3 teams
[3:59:20] Dagobert2424: NA will probably stagnate and EU not enough experience
[3:59:28] biteSMS: Jackeylove too bad
[3:59:30] Dagobert2424: It will be all about LCK vs LPL
[3:59:33] 1kenn1: iG players gave me that vibe that they're only here to collect that cheque
[3:59:40] biteSMS: disappointed
[4:00:03] michaelsund: If teams practice seriously bo1 or bo3 isnt that big of a deal
[4:00:29] michaelsund: But western culture is bad Kappa
[4:01:12] hnbl10: @GiorgioMastrota_ everyone thinks stage experience is not important :D sure will see how these practice will work out for them
[4:01:49] u_can_u_up: i have the same keyboard
[4:01:49] hnbl10: @GiorgioMastrota_ Bo1 is just for money, nothing else
[4:02:13] AbcxYDE: VG is about to make the comeback of a century and stomp WE 2-0 just wait
[4:02:15] 1kenn1: bo1 is less boring imo
[4:02:16] michaelsund: L'Or√©al 4Head
[4:02:22] 1kenn1: for LCS
[4:02:25] ayasai: @biteSMS imp is worse
[4:02:29] AbcxYDE: Meow PogChamp
[4:02:32] Dagobert2424: play on stage is like doing a presentation if you do it more often you will get better at it
[4:02:33] winwin311: U mean 2-1?
[4:02:40] michaelsund: I love that every team plays the same day
[4:02:57] AbcxYDE: Jinjiao is the worst LPL ad carry if you disagree youre wrong
[4:03:13] hnbl10: sure less boring for viewers maybe, just dont complain later that teams cant compete against more experienced LPL and LCK
[4:03:57] hnbl10: I would prefer to see EU and NA getting better, not stagnate and waiting for 1 cheese game
[4:04:23] Dagobert2424: may work to get out of groups though but not in quarters
[4:04:51] AbcxYDE: bo1 doesnt even help with groups because youre still getting way less practice throughout the year
[4:05:09] 1kenn1: G2 was great in bo5
[4:05:25] hnbl10: Bo1 won't help in groups because you played less games through a year
[4:05:29] Moobot: No links allowed (biteSMS) (warning)
[4:05:33] AbcxYDE: When galio is being firstpicked you know a meta is shit
[4:06:01] PulseIRL: wah PogChamp
[4:06:01] Moobot: No links allowed (biteSMS)
[4:06:06] hnbl10: part of reason why SSG won Worlds is because they played tons of games together
[4:06:11] Dagobert2424: LuL
[4:06:31] AbcxYDE: WE has a really strong read on this meta
[4:06:32] GLPhoenix: @RiotPulse PogChamp
[4:06:44] winwin311: Gailo ResidentSleeper
[4:07:02] 1kenn1: the meta fits SSG playstyle at worlds
[4:07:15] jackeyca: The scene is familiar. SwiftRage
[4:07:27] 1kenn1: the meta completely covered their weak early game
[4:07:38] jackeyca: VG gg
[4:07:41] AbcxYDE: When janna is being banned you know a meta is shit
[4:08:07] GuardianFiddler: "the meta", not "a meta"
[4:08:09] Dagobert2424: I think a team like RNG could have beaten SSG as they showed in group stage
[4:08:27] biteSMS: lpl ResidentSleeper lck PogChamp
[4:08:31] hnbl10: @1kenn1 SSG learned through years how to defend themselves in early game, I dont buy stuff about meta fit them
[4:08:32] G_ginin_der: Edg win?
[4:08:44] biteSMS: blg win
[4:08:44] hnbl10: every team should adapt to meta
[4:08:49] jackeyca: @g_ginin_der yes
[4:08:51] AbcxYDE: lpl ResidentSleeper lck ResidentSleeper tsm PogChamp

[4:09:11] yunaditra: condi is back!!!!!
[4:09:14] nickthierry: CBLOL PogChamp
[4:09:17] hnbl10: RNG could win 1 or 2 games I guess and then SSG should adapt
[4:09:39] hnbl10: everything depends how mlxg would play
[4:09:49] AbcxYDE: WE is about to park that fucking bus
[4:09:50] ChaoticFireOCE: still no thresh picks in pro :/ feelsbadman
[4:10:06] winwin311: Ben picked it once
[4:10:09] biteSMS: mlxg will let the team lose the game
[4:10:14] 1kenn1: SSG was practicing Twitch vs RNG
[4:10:18] ChaoticFireOCE: DAMN i missed it??
[4:10:24] 1kenn1: Ruler never really played twitch
[4:10:38] winwin311: It was against ss I think
[4:10:39] hnbl10: mlxg is 50/50
[4:10:55] AbcxYDE: MLXG is just sandbagging for rift rivals
[4:10:58] ChaoticFireOCE: @winwin311 how did he perform?>
[4:11:09] PulseIRL: Snek could be good this split
[4:11:10] AbcxYDE: TSM won the first series
[4:11:16] winwin311: They got stomped
[4:11:23] ÊàëÂÖàÊîæ‰∏™Â§πÂ≠êÈ©¨ÂÖã‰∏Ä‰∏ã: WE win
[4:11:43] maGicR_74: TTours
[4:11:44] AbcxYDE: I want VG's comp to win because it's 10x more fun but I know it wont
[4:11:54] ChaoticFireOCE: So opinions from you guys, best 3 supps atm? from what i am seeing its tahm, taric, braum?
[4:12:04] PulseIRL: @pogchampignonlol great name Kreygasm
[4:12:05] AbcxYDE: yeah
[4:12:06] ÊàëÂÖàÊîæ‰∏™Â§πÂ≠êÈ©¨ÂÖã‰∏Ä‰∏ã: SSG uoguo
[4:12:15] AbcxYDE: Janna is very strong too
[4:12:23] PulseIRL: 2:0 EDG, wasn't even close
[4:12:24] hnbl10: @ChaoticFireOCE and Alistar to this list
[4:12:29] Dagobert2424: Leona maybe too
[4:12:32] ChaoticFireOCE: Im a thresh main haha, need to expand pool. not sure what to learn first?
[4:12:41] 1kenn1: I wish they buffed aggressive supports like blitz
[4:12:44] winwin311: Shen
[4:12:48] ChaoticFireOCE: i can play leona, played a bit of ali
[4:12:53] c_ide: @ChaoticFireOCE I expected to see Brand more after the buffs, he does so much dmg
[4:13:18] ChaoticFireOCE: hmm @le_lh true, but so easy to catch out in lower elos with bad position
[4:13:33] ChaoticFireOCE: thats why i prefer hard engage supps. easy to punish squishy supps
[4:13:56] c_ide: yeah tank supports are really strong with the double relic meta
[4:14:09] Dagobert2424: Ornn support is kinda good too
[4:14:22] ChaoticFireOCE: but double relic meta is gone now
[4:14:25] PulseIRL: I like that it's gotten to a point where chat responds to me in weeb emotes TehePelo
[4:14:31] ChaoticFireOCE: they hard nerfed relic
[4:14:50] c_ide: that's live already? thought it wouldn't be for a week or two
[4:14:57] ChaoticFireOCE: well in OCE at least.
[4:15:00] milenchobe: top dead [monkaS
[4:15:07] ÊàëÂÖàÊîæ‰∏™Â§πÂ≠êÈ©¨ÂÖã‰∏Ä‰∏ã: 957????
[4:15:09] c_ide: 8.2?
[4:15:24] ChaoticFireOCE: people dont read patch notes. had 3 adc's today take relic only to find it didnt give a shield
[4:15:31] winwin311: 8.1
[4:15:40] nickthierry: LUL
[4:15:41] ChaoticFireOCE: yeah 8.2 no sighstone. it messed up my go to thres build. feelsbad,man
[4:16:08] ChaoticFireOCE: @le_lh the supp item patch was released monday this week in OCE
[4:16:13] ÊàëÂÖàÊîæ‰∏™Â§πÂ≠êÈ©¨ÂÖã‰∏Ä‰∏ã: WE again
[4:16:16] ChaoticFireOCE: rip to talisman
[4:16:21] c_ide: then i think dmg supports will rise a bit. since no need to dump 800g into sighstone it's faster damage items
[4:16:36] Dagobert2424: TP cait LuL
[4:17:02] ChaoticFireOCE: yeah ap mage supps are good atm, you get the supp item then go full dmg. because your supp item goes active warding after 500g
[4:17:30] Kaneki_Touka: edg won?
[4:17:36] winwin311: Yea
[4:17:41] c_ide: also if anyone is interested, Gigabyte Marines playing in 20 mins over in VCS, whisper me for link :)
[4:20:02] ChaoticFireOCE: :^)
[4:22:06] 1kenn1: and they still got 1st turret
[4:22:11] 1kenn1: how bad is VG lol

[4:23:12] ChaoticFireOCE: sorry to be annoying haha. but is morg any good right now, in support
[4:23:27] 1kenn1: no shes awful
[4:23:57] ChaoticFireOCE: rip :( she is my fall back supp atm if thresh is banned
[4:24:06] winwin311: Ez PogChamp
[4:26:14] Hagoo: It's amazing how many supports can't utilise tarics ult to maximum effectiveness
[4:26:42] c_ide: so many popping it so early
[4:26:51] Dagobert2424: Taric ult requires a lot of communication and team synergy
[4:26:59] ChaoticFireOCE: @Hagoo in soloq?
[4:27:39] Hagoo: nah in proplay, using it before they even commit, using it too late etc. The one's where it's too early are more likely a communication problem
[4:28:12] maGicR_74: PogChamp
[4:28:16] Hagoo: Damn Ben almost making a disgusting play
[4:28:18] one_more_plz: blast cone PogChamp

[4:30:56] FK_P: even lpl is having low amount of kills DansGame
[4:32:05] FK_P: balanced
[4:32:36] Dagobert2424: VG team has too much magic dmg they cant kill galio
[4:32:54] GLPhoenix: @FK_P both of these teams prefer playing slow, so its understandable for games between them to have lower kill numbers
[4:33:12] ÊàëÂÖàÊîæ‰∏™Â§πÂ≠êÈ©¨ÂÖã‰∏Ä‰∏ã: VG still LSPL team
[4:33:39] 1kenn1: Crash is such a 2017 jungler
