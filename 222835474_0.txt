[3:23:22] bluejimmy168: Haters are gonna say otherwise
[3:23:28] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz I would expect a 40cs lead into a melee but against a gnar will professional wave manipulation
[3:23:31] captainsmeb: go watch one of the ebst top laners in the world. And probably the ebst jayce in the world play jayce
[3:23:32] bluejimmy168: Haters gonna hate

[3:23:41] GummiGrim: @bluejimmy168 It's obviously Hauntzer who is the greatest Jayce Kappa
[3:23:42] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz and you’re expecting a 40 cs lead in a range cs range matchup
[3:23:47] rengarizmeinananrengarist: xiye gonna carry that game hard
[3:23:53] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 yes
[3:23:57] Mechafanboy: Hmm... gold is pretty even for cs leads in 2 lanes. (large one at that for Azir.)
[3:24:04] GummiGrim: @fuzzyth8 People are stubborn, I don't think you're changing this guy's mind
[3:24:09] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 jayce chucks you down 100-10 pct in one trade

[3:25:08] AbcxYDE: You understand unlike Khan Gimgoon is not a one trick pony?
[3:25:11] HeyMaath: ScaredyCat
[3:25:18] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 becasue they play counters matchups
[3:25:19] AbcxYDE: of course Khan is stronger on his one trick
[3:25:29] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 and they dont blind gnar with jayce up
[3:25:35] prozealotrush: skt so trash this year

[3:26:34] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 yes
[3:26:35] AbcxYDE: You seem to be a fanboy so I'm not gonna talk with you
[3:26:39] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 and tower gone
[3:26:46] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 but they arent playing around him
[3:26:50] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz I guess you’re a jayce god too?
[3:27:03] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 d3 60 pc wr
[3:27:11] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 but i always win lane
[3:27:21] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz you should you’re jayce
[3:27:45] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 if you pick jayce as a counter into gnar, you should play around it, if you dont then you dont know what youre doing
[3:28:07] AbcxYDE: FPX is winning the match vs a top 4 worlds team they know what theyre doing
[3:28:14] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 one of the highest skillcap champs in the game
[3:28:16] skygannn: ANELE
[3:28:43] AbcxYDE: FPX played around bot side because the Varus ult and Braum ult easily sets up kills
[3:28:44] 83749394793: 0-3 taric
[3:28:55] mujarshad: banned 4Head
[3:29:03] swineflu111: LUL
[3:29:03] bluejimmy168: damn
[3:29:06] Mechafanboy: I mean.. dunno about that, Jayce is basically one skillshot, if it hits, you're a god, if it doesn't wait for it to come back up. That's pretty much it....
[3:29:10] Munchinsteaks: fpx do not know what they are doing they are winning because we are avoiding any way of giving a large early lead that cant come back from
[3:29:11] Qwuntumfeildz: @AbcxYDE yea but that isnt what there pick ban dictates
[3:29:15] bluejimmy168: mod is mad at me :(
[3:29:27] AbcxYDE: as decided by you
[3:29:44] Deskullx: YES YES
[3:29:47] Qwuntumfeildz: y point
[3:29:48] Deskullx: LETS FUCKIN GOO WE
[3:29:48] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz you said the jayce was bad, would you just say the team is bad then for not playing around the pick?
[3:29:52] 83749394793: wtf

[3:31:17] daiognailgn: 生死看淡，不服就干
[3:31:44] 我先放个夹子马克一下: i dont care game just want u die
[3:31:47] Qwuntumfeildz: @AbcxYDE doesnt take einstien to realize most teams in the game dont know hot to play aorund jayce
[3:31:50] pandastarks: lwx心里也是mmp
[3:31:55] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz but tbh if they do play around the jayce they should have a 40 cs lead but they didn’t so misplay by them
[3:32:03] Qwuntumfeildz: @AbcxYDE there is a reason y jayce really only works in korea
[3:32:09] Deskullx: GG\
[3:32:22] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: ThunBeast oohhhh
[3:32:24] AbcxYDE: WE wins with jayce all the time dude

[3:32:34] AbcxYDE: you have no clue about LPL at all
[3:32:38] kaanlower: ez we
[3:32:42] milenchobe: Xiye is monster on jayce
[3:32:45] mujarshad: WE plays jayce mid more than top
[3:32:48] milenchobe: lucian 2
[3:32:49] AbcxYDE: Jayce is literally one of WE's best champs
[3:32:59] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 skt with huni? and smeb?
[3:33:14] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz not as well as kingzone
[3:33:15] Qwuntumfeildz: @AbcxYDE agreed i forgot he plays it mid
[3:33:32] AbcxYDE: you didnt forget anything you dont watch this league
[3:33:32] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 yea but better than the rest of the world
[3:33:39] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz not jumping in the bandwagon but I think khans jayce is just on another level
[3:33:44] bestsnake9: This azir omg
[3:33:53] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 tb i like smebs and huni jayce more

[3:34:09] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 khan recieves alot of resources
[3:34:11] FoxMulder4: Xiye dominated on Jayce much stronger than Khan
[3:34:26] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz yeah but that’s what they should do
[3:34:38] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 if you watch smeb play it
[3:34:44] ayasai: late game Azir & Caitlyn Kreygasm
[3:34:45] 阿東顆顆: ?

[3:35:19] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 huni and khan jaye are super similar
[3:35:48] Qwuntumfeildz: @turbokid1234 they each have their strengths
[3:36:11] fuzzyth8: @qwuntumfeildz I’m probs just bandwagoning in Khan
[3:36:26] Qwuntumfeildz: @fuzzyth8 yea hes super good
[3:36:27] mujarshad: rusty sounds so sad BibleThump

Look how they mesh so well already.. its actually insane if there was a tournament right now from the best teams KT , KSV etc.. im sure TL would beat them all just based on the rosters. DL is almost considered the best adc in the world and also impact is the best toplaner ever.
[5:23:42] pierson: i wouldnt put anything past the lck. ik tl iz great however i think there r a little overhyped for only 1 week wait till mod season and if they still look this good then we can start talking worlds

[6:13:29] Baldier3: Does somebody know why maokai jungle aren't really meta in comp, with dual ap lanes being chosen so often?

[6:13:37] RozeXarocas: btw Jax is 4-0 in LCK... Spirit played it today and won @RUSTYTheCASTER
[6:13:37] fstln: jax jungle:D
[6:13:45] vinsmokekw: ornn banned?
[6:13:48] KNOK1ZYGIS: @RUSTYTheCASTER so the reasoning behind this is not to get W from Janna and AA from varus when he wants cannon?
[6:13:51] RustyTheCaster: That might bump Jax to 15% presence total
[6:13:52] colonel_zee: Isn`t Maokai`s clear super slow?
[6:13:55] mujarshad: it's from the runes
[6:14:07] LawlGiraffes: ok thx guys
