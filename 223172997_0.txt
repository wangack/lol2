[2:24:12] scottoflorida2014: @cursedexistance He struggled last year after RR too. He;s just not ready for prime time imo
[2:24:19] TheRushPro: Best ADC in 2018
[2:24:27] TheRushPro: Teddy 1400+ CS

[2:24:29] chrissong2: PogChamp
[2:24:39] chrissong2: outplay PogChamp
[2:24:54] scottoflorida2014: That was the best 94 minute game I ever sat thru @TheRushPro

[2:26:09] vhhush: Meow Meowkai
[2:26:11] LmaoLp: @scottofl2014 not exactly disagreeing, but i actually think tsm was probably the worst team possible for him to jump to. when they lose at groups this time, who's gonna cop the flak? 🤔

[2:26:51] scottoflorida2014: @cursedexistance I can't figure that team out. They can play so well and then play so bad the next game. I don't see this current line up doing much tho
[2:26:57] LmaoLp: @dlow_meow that'd be an even worse situation.
[2:26:58] vhhush: TP ADC LUL
[2:27:09] vhhush: spellbook OP
[2:27:13] armaann: you guys realize sven was shit last year right
[2:27:21] scottoflorida2014: I agree @dlow_meow unless they make big changes after the spring split
[2:27:24] armaann: i hate tsm but sven isnt a martyr or whatever you act like
[2:27:34] llleeeaaannn: I can see them swapping junglers very soon though
[2:27:50] scottoflorida2014: How is he doing with C9? I haven't even watched a game yet

[2:28:20] Tishuen: they lost
[2:28:24] Excomm: C9 macro looks good, mechanics still not so good
[2:28:28] LmaoLp: i doubt tsm will swap junglers until at least halfway through split. they'll just blame gelling as a team until such a time

[2:30:10] SKT_KKona: Snake is the chinese tsm? 🤔

[2:31:35] Kreppo_fav_number_15: yes
[2:31:35] armaann: TSMs issue is they cant play the game the right way so they just play for baron throws by bad NA teams
[2:31:44] lul4headxd: i wouldn't get rid of bjerg if i were regi regardless of how good he is, he just keeps making NA finals. winning worlds is unrealistic goal for 5 years now
[2:31:58] armaann: and that doesnt work when you have to play good teams that dont give up 1k leads in lane phase
[2:32:08] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: armaann tell me more about your analysis of TSM CoolStoryBob

[6:02:54] winwin311: yea
[6:03:03] AbcxYDE: Teams like Jingdong, Suning, iG and Snake all got better this split while OMG didn't do anything to improve

[6:40:36] rarepepepls: @SnakeOneMLG faker streaming, lck
[6:40:36] mujarshad: most people don't really watch lpl that much
[6:40:43] mujarshad: on twitch
[6:40:51] mujarshad: i think more people watch on youtube
[6:40:57] RustyTheCaster: I believe that we're gonna get a few more viewers though as the season goes, 1080p and consistent streams now :)
[6:40:58] sakura_chain: lpl isnt that popular in the west
[6:40:59] SolarLexus: the match up is much more interesting rn imo
[6:41:03] SnakeOneAPM: is EDG ray the same ray that was in C9?
[6:41:08] XersusMid: put back clearlove
[6:41:17] mujarshad: yes c9 ray
[6:41:22] YvesSaintRahman: @rustythecaster you’ll get more when China wins worlds this year Kappa
[6:41:26] sakura_chain: @RUSTYTheCASTER hopefully no more audio ussues Kappa
[6:41:27] lilaobayihun88: yea c9
[6:41:30] window7player: is this a rebroadcast?
[6:41:47] SolarLexus: china will have a good shot at it
[6:41:52] Yoganshmire: It’s okay rusty there’s a million chinese people watching right now on whatever streaming services the Chinese government allows
[6:41:58] In_bangkok: gg
[6:42:04] SolarLexus: this
[6:42:05] AbcxYDE: Clearlove in game 2 pls
[6:42:12] NIK0e: Ez 4 odds
[6:42:19] AbcxYDE: haro is ass
[6:42:22] MingLee_Man: Xin Zhao items WutFace
[6:42:36] lilaobayihun88: @abcxyde Are you sure?
[6:42:36] SolarLexus: drakee
[6:42:44] window7player: xz is limping
[6:42:46] AbcxYDE: I mean I want him in
[6:42:47] mujarshad: i mean lpl is better to watch for casual viewers than lck
[6:42:48] YvesSaintRahman: If OMG beat EDG WutFace WutFace
[6:42:50] AbcxYDE: he probably wont actually play
[6:42:56] neoticusss: xin crippled NotLikeThis Sivir crippled NotLikeThis
[6:42:59] mujarshad: but most people don't know about it
[6:43:05] uqcm: in an innovative new global trade deal, the rest of the world is forced to watch LPL
[6:43:07] lilaobayihun88: LUL
[6:43:07] binxtor: Xin Zhao PogChamp
[6:43:13] SolarLexus: shiv was a good pick nabs
[6:43:17] YvesSaintRahman: @mujarshad LPL is the most violent region just non stop fighting PogChamp PogChamp
[6:43:23] XersusMid: i think clearlove will come back later like he did last year
[6:43:24] mujarshad: yeah
[6:43:34] SolarLexus: they need the burst
[6:43:35] luccid: cmonBruh
[6:43:36] mujarshad: like even the bad team constantly force fights
[6:43:39] SolarLexus: vs supps
[6:43:50] mujarshad: so even though the quality is not high it's really entertaining
[6:43:54] Yoganshmire: Yeah this meta so far has been a snooze fest
[6:44:05] YvesSaintRahman: @mujarshad China have too many upcoming talent spread across all the teams
[6:44:09] SolarLexus: lol quality not high. what?
[6:44:10] window7player: playing xz in pro league?
[6:44:16] RustyTheCaster: I think that's why Korea can be boring
[6:44:20] RustyTheCaster: the bottom teams do the opposite to LPL
[6:44:22] RustyTheCaster: never fight
[6:44:28] mujarshad: ye
[6:44:30] YvesSaintRahman: @cypressbay LPL was the best to watch at this meta
[6:44:42] RustyTheCaster: the top LCK teams are obviously very good still so they're great to watch
[6:44:42] YvesSaintRahman: @solarlexus macro
[6:44:45] SolarLexus: they play in the most safe and successful way mate
[6:44:57] Yoganshmire: This is how league dies, season 10 66 minute average games
[6:45:03] Yoganshmire: 8 kills
[6:45:13] SolarLexus: if you only care about drama and 100 kills keep playing low elo ranked xD
[6:45:15] yamiiyami: next patch we get the NUNU
[6:45:28] mujarshad: @YvesSaintRahman most lpl teams don't make best macro decisions but they are more entertaining to watch
[6:45:28] AbcxYDE: oh god the nunu, why riot why
[6:45:33] YvesSaintRahman: @solarlexus people like both
[6:45:40] Yoganshmire: We won’t see a single nunu game in competitive
[6:45:42] sakura_chain: @SolarLexus watching is different than playing
[6:45:50] Yoganshmire: He will be 100% banned
[6:45:53] SolarLexus: i think its highly entertaining.
[6:45:53] yamiiyami: just wait for 1 game when nunu isn't banned
[6:46:07] RustyTheCaster: I don't think the LPL even makes bad calls, it just seems that way
[6:46:08] mujarshad: tsm will leave nunu open
[6:46:16] Yoganshmire: LOL ^
[6:46:26] mujarshad: disagree cmonBruh
[6:46:41] RustyTheCaster: in a game of % gains, we take higher risk higher reward options
[6:46:42] YvesSaintRahman: @solarlexus China without macro = 2nd best, China with macro = number 1 PogChamp PogChamp
[6:46:46] O1iver_Francis: iBoy still having Lexy PTSDs LUL
[6:47:06] mujarshad: LUL
[6:47:07] RustyTheCaster: LCK wants 100% clear plays, LPL can drop as low as 51% for the bad teams
[6:47:16] hnbl10: wait, wtf is that, Xin Zhao in game ? and he is winning ???
[6:47:22] AbcxYDE: I think WE and EDG generally have good macro while RNG gets away with just okay macro because of talent
[6:47:29] Yoganshmire: In LCK it’s like a gentleman’s agreement to just farm till it’s time for objectives
[6:47:33] sorrythaturfat: :(
[6:47:49] YvesSaintRahman: @abcxyde I just want IG at worlds BibleThump BibleThump
[6:47:50] O1iver_Francis: RNG Talent... MLXD LUL
[6:47:50] mujarshad: @CypressBay no that's eu
[6:47:55] SolarLexus: @Hnbl10 Counterplay
[6:48:09] AbcxYDE: iG will have a great chance to get to worlds if EDG keeps playing like this lol
[6:48:15] lilaobayihun88: Why does OMG have a dragon and buff doesn't attack? ？
[6:48:35] BboyBlock: i hate how that dude emphasizes every last word
[6:48:35] trisssmerigold: @RUSTYTheCASTER its more like LCK casters makes every mistakes like god play from the side benefiting while LPL casters laught at every mistakes hype it as clown fiesta, so ppl get the general idea differently,
[6:48:36] SolarLexus: keeps playing like this? One loss like that musn't matter much
[6:48:39] YvesSaintRahman: @abcxyde EDG will get number 1 don’t worry, IG will beat out either WE or RNG
[6:48:43] hnbl10: @SolarLexus counter to reksai or what?
[6:48:46] SolarLexus: and they can certainly still win
[6:48:47] Yoganshmire: I haven’t watched much EULCS this year
[6:48:49] window7player: xz is limping...lol
[6:48:54] SolarLexus: to the support kog comp
[6:49:01] SolarLexus: the late game comp
[6:49:05] RustyTheCaster: Sure, we're also generally more critical of mistakes because I believe it's fair to call them as they are
[6:49:05] trisssmerigold: @RUSTYTheCASTER when competeing on world stage, as happneed many times in the past international tournys, the play style doesnt differ that much as meta differ
[6:49:19] RustyTheCaster: but LCK wins worlds so it doesn't matter what we say everyone will just believe they're the best
[6:49:22] roll1ng1: edg dont have better late game
[6:49:49] hnbl10: @SolarLexus really ? how does it suppose to work ?
[6:49:57] SolarLexus: That's a bold statement. I wouldn't be too sure HassanChop
[6:50:01] rarepepepls: :(
[6:50:11] AbcxYDE: The only way Snake gets to worlds is if Light starts playing
[6:50:17] Yoganshmire: I mean would you call any other region besides LCK the best?
[6:50:18] YvesSaintRahman: @zoomenhanced their mid yagao (forgot how to spell) is good
[6:50:26] RustyTheCaster: Krystal is currently carrying tho
[6:50:30] YvesSaintRahman: @cypressbay yes NALCS
[6:50:45] uqcm: will omg win workds
[6:50:47] xyandraa: LUL
[6:50:50] AbcxYDE: Krystal is good I rate him above average but the competition for top 3 is fierce this year
[6:50:53] YvesSaintRahman: @zoomenhanced mb
[6:50:56] yamiiyami: why xin has shiv
[6:51:03] trisssmerigold: @RUSTYTheCASTER by that logic, LCS games are all bronze games and all casters should all be hysterical and laughing their ass off, no its merely poor understanding and poor casting, the pro team and playstyle doesnt differ that much
[6:51:05] neoticusss: CypressBay Im sure some Brazilians believe CBLOL is best league
[6:51:05] roll1ng1: bbq wins worlds easy LUL
[6:51:07] zairoo_: @AbcxYDE light is not on snake anymore
[6:51:08] Dagobert2424: Krystal Draven in MSI finals
[6:51:17] SolarLexus: @Hnbl10 With a suppression of the success of Kog early. With rather aggressive play and early map control. This leads to gold advantage and an early edge. We'll see if it works troughoutly
[6:51:30] RustyTheCaster: I'm not speaking from my perspective, I wouldn't say our casting paints our region as a fiesta by any means
[6:51:31] AbcxYDE: im pretty sure he is
[6:51:36] trisssmerigold: @RUSTYTheCASTER while the attemtps not that much more mistakes, than theyre good plays from the other side
[6:51:42] yamiiyami: he is going shiv IE the god
[6:51:55] hnbl10: @SolarLexus yea but there are many early game junglers to do that, lets see how it works
[6:52:22] RustyTheCaster: I'm pretty sure that's a delusion painted by the west who don't watch our region
[6:52:23] Yoganshmire: I really enjoy everyone in the LPL casting besides the goku caster
[6:52:23] SolarLexus: Potential to really end it fast. And he kind of needs it to have a "symbiosis" in his build
[6:52:47] Yoganshmire: It’s not like he’s bad either his voice just kinda bothers me
[6:52:52] SolarLexus: @Hnbl10 Xin was the best option if you ask me
[6:53:10] djjohnnymelster: support fiesta happened because jiezou retired
[6:53:23] RustyTheCaster: Which one Cypress? I'm not sure who the 'goku' one it hah
[6:53:27] hnbl10: yesterday match TSM vs OPT was terrible, TSM is not playing good at all, OPT was just tragic, I think Braum didn't block any Ornn ulti and Gnar lost lane to GP ??
[6:53:27] RustyTheCaster: is*
[6:53:44] Yoganshmire: The one with the crazy hair the Asian guy
[6:53:46] Liquidhateh20: finally a xin zhao game Kreygasm
[6:53:46] RustyTheCaster: Unless you mean pulse because he is hair goku
[6:53:46] AbcxYDE: Zig and Akadian played so bad
[6:53:47] boscod55: LPL CHAMP POOL >>>> LCK CHAMP POOL
[6:53:47] RustyTheCaster: right
[6:53:59] window7player: no black cleaver for xin?
[6:54:28] hnbl10: how Zig could lose lane as Gnar to GP ? why he was so scared, building Frozen Mallet first

[6:58:41] Yoganshmire: That’s funny
[6:58:46] mujarshad: and hard carried
[6:59:15] mujarshad: Clid Lee is 1v9
[6:59:20] MisakiKureha: usually game times are long and kind of passive early and lee is not really an ideal pick in the current meta either
[6:59:43] djjohnnymelster: flawless lee PogChamp
[7:00:12] mujarshad: if enemy has GP you can pick lee for easy dives, it's really good, but most people are not willing to gamble on that
[7:00:29] Yoganshmire: I really hope these games get better or I won’t be watching much league this season I’d rather play FarmVille then watch it🙄
[7:00:58] mujarshad: bs, league team fights are still super exciting
[7:01:05] yamiiyami: everything will be fixed with NUNU PogChamp
[7:01:36] Yoganshmire: It doesn’t matter how exciting they are if I need to watch 40 minutes of PvE beforehand
[7:02:21] MisakiKureha: few years ago I watched almost every regions games if I had time but meh now I only check lpl cause of fav teams and caster so I understand what you mean @CypressBay

[8:09:12] GoodBoiTroll: @DefensiveLoL their roster actully makes sense for once
[8:09:20] BboyBlock: hurdur rengo jungle
[8:09:40] longest_johnny: Not gonna lie, I could see Echo Fox take like 3rd place this split
[8:09:44] mujarshad: i got Jebaited
[8:09:45] FittyF5ve: I was surprised to see froggen go for fenix though
[8:09:55] mujarshad: @Calvin2650 who are first 2
[8:09:56] GoodBoiTroll: @Calvin2650 agreed
[8:09:56] Yoganshmire: Could this be the year someone besides TSM C9 or CLG wins the split?
[8:09:57] FittyF5ve: Echo Fox will win this split
[8:10:19] Kennishi: danS
[8:10:20] Yoganshmire: U guys know TSM is gunna win the split...
[8:10:20] FittyF5ve: They wont win summer I think, but they definitely have the firepower to win spring
[8:10:22] mujarshad: fenix is better than froggen
[8:10:23] KayneAlexander: PogChamp

[8:10:41] 我先放个夹子马克一下: ResidentSleeper
[8:10:44] carlin_da_borracharia: SwiftRage
[8:10:45] Yoganshmire: You know what I realized
[8:10:56] FittyF5ve: I'd be glad to see TSM miss worlds
[8:10:56] Yoganshmire: Reddit has a crazy strong recency bias
[8:10:58] GoodBoiTroll: @BboyBlock dont u mean not getting into the finals?
[8:11:11] KayneAlexander: TSM, EchoFox and C9 will go to worlds this year SeemsGood
[8:11:14] longest_johnny: I really like 100 Thieves. Will look forward to watch them improve, cause they ae really mechanically gifted players
[8:11:41] FittyF5ve: 100 thieves have the best macro in NA
[8:11:43] Yoganshmire: I think the bo1 format is kinda fucking TSM over
[8:11:46] GoodBoiTroll: @Calvin2650 they have the team and coaching staff
[8:11:46] Type_LUL_If_Trick_Dies: VoHiYo
[8:11:54] yousefbruh: in lpl channel people talk about na :D
[8:11:55] mujarshad: i think it's possible tsm not make semis in spring
[8:11:56] leavesinwind: @defensivelol I think NA would be better
[8:11:58] BboyBlock: no not making worlds finals are meh but if they dont make worlds that would mean more imports
[8:11:59] Yoganshmire: If it was bo3 I think TSM would be 3-0
[8:12:03] Type_LUL_If_Trick_Dies: EDG have more girl fan LUL
[8:12:08] FittyF5ve: Well last year they lost how many game 1s? @cypressbay
[8:12:15] mujarshad: tsm is playing awful right now
[8:12:19] BboyBlock: oh yea they are good at bo3s
[8:12:20] FittyF5ve: They actually had a losing record in game 1 last split
[8:12:37] mujarshad: no way they would be better performing in bo3
[8:12:44] BboyBlock: they are horrendous at bo1
[8:12:47] Yoganshmire: Yeah last split they would always drop firstgame and then win the next two
[8:12:55] BboyBlock: they always have been
[8:13:05] mujarshad: last split they wouldn't aram mid for 20 minutes
[8:13:10] longest_johnny: TSM is gonna win the split, very shaky start, but they have the best roster for sure! It's still week 2 and they will recover, trust
[8:13:24] Demzdateetz: lel
[8:13:34] Brioluu: No way that anyone can say that they for sure hacve the best rostewr
[8:13:39] Demzdateetz: tsmin2k18feelsbadman
[8:13:40] FittyF5ve: I think franchising is great for everyone. better infrastructure is key to improving the region, but i hate bo1
[8:13:48] DeadlyGhost96: @cypressbay it's bo1 now, but if they can make it to playoffs, then they'll prolly mske the finals. I believe TL or 100T will win this spli tho

[8:14:37] Felissie: i think if they want a bo1 then they should do four round robin instead of two

[8:16:38] longest_johnny: What are you guys predictions for tonights matches? Feel free to message me private for a talk about picks
[8:16:41] Yoganshmire: The thing about Korea is that they take esports way more serious
[8:17:07] FittyF5ve: True but that mentality shift is slowly happening here as well
[8:17:10] Yoganshmire: I don’t think NA will ever take esports as serious as Korea and therefore they will always lag behind
[8:17:17] GoodBoiTroll: @CypressBay na only have the money
[8:17:33] Yoganshmire: Exactly and money can’t buy heart
[8:17:35] FK_P: the problem is their soloq is stronger
[8:17:35] longest_johnny: Lots of money, no skill LUL
[8:17:42] FK_P: so they have more mechanics
[8:17:46] FittyF5ve: Idk. im pretty sure in a decade Esports will outpace real sports worldwide
[8:17:49] GoodBoiTroll: @CypressBay lol tell that to samsung
[8:17:50] carlin_da_borracharia: ESports in korea have been serious even before 2000.
[8:17:57] FK_P: the only place with good enough mechanics is china, but their macro is worse
[8:18:03] Yoganshmire: No it won’t
[8:18:07] GoodBoiTroll: ksv bought them for too much money bro

[8:18:10] Yoganshmire: Esports won’t ever be as big as a sport like soccwe

[8:35:57] Yoganshmire: That was a big smack in the face to just change the rule like that after all those people moved to their regions expecting to be a resident after 2 years
[8:36:04] b3nnyxd: gg ray
[8:36:07] mujarshad: ray is the only reason edg is still in the game lol

[8:37:23] colonel_zee: I don't think it has been revealed?? But it's not the first time Clearlove is benched
[8:37:26] Yoganshmire: If clearlove is still on the EDG roster than they are giving haro a chance to play so he gets bwtter
[8:37:40] minato_kag3aki: we almost get to see multiple LPL superteams . LCK would not be this dominate
[8:37:41] colonel_zee: just like before with Fireloli, either he's taking a break or they're trying to develop the rookie talent
