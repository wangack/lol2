[0:30:58] tom_t3h_pom: Yes
[0:31:04] cTrix: LUL
[0:31:14] tom_t3h_pom: 2-1 to MVP
[0:32:00] cTrix: It's like they didnt practice at all before the split
[0:33:03] tom_t3h_pom: i think they all think they are to good and when you get a team that pays for each other it can beat them
[0:33:11] tom_t3h_pom: plays*
[0:33:36] lllllllllli: skt worst team korea
[0:33:50] MomokiMay: They aren't 10th place though.
[0:33:55] MomokiMay: ...Yet LuL
[0:34:16] lllllllllli: when i watch nasus misclick his tp i wanted to jump off a cliff
[0:34:23] cTrix: SKT was never the team with the best players in every role
[0:34:24] LowKeyTheOne: dang they got the jams while we wait ngl
[0:34:36] cTrix: the way SKT won so much was because their macro was next level insane
[0:34:52] cTrix: And also Faker
[0:35:04] LowKeyTheOne: mostly faker
[0:35:09] MomokiMay: I honestly think Khan is the current best player in korea or maybe the world right now
[0:35:11] sakura_chain: is this haywyre
[0:35:13] cTrix: No mostly macro you git
[0:35:21] MomokiMay: he's looking so good, every time
[0:35:31] zewm: Trap?
[0:35:35] cTrix: But for some reason they fired half their team
[0:35:41] lllllllllli: how can they lose to a team that is 0-11 in the split
[0:35:43] breakerfaith: damn this song go in
[0:35:45] sakura_chain: smeb was once the best top and player in the world too before
[0:35:46] LowKeyTheOne: i mean i think thepure presence of faker struck fear into the opposition
[0:35:47] cTrix: so now there's no synergy
[0:36:02] LowKeyTheOne: yeah happened to a few teams this split it seems
[0:36:15] sakura_chain: MVP didn't look like they're scared of SKT in the last game.
[0:36:17] cTrix: Faker can't hard carry 1v9 is the thing
[0:36:18] zewm: @CTrix actually, Bang has been playing like crap since last worlds tbh
[0:36:23] sakura_chain: I mean Faker
[0:36:23] cTrix: that's why there's losing so much now
[0:36:30] zewm: So don't just attribute the losing to the newbs
[0:36:41] 1kenn1: faker sucks too
[0:36:43] cTrix: Have you SEEN the nasus tp ?
[0:36:50] zewm: Also putting faker on on stuff like Galio, why?
[0:37:00] 1kenn1: nasus galio is funny as hell
[0:37:01] zewm: It's like when Urgod mid was in meta
[0:37:04] Urogna: The nasus tp lul
[0:37:10] cTrix: yeah I dont understand why Faker doesnt just play hardcarries
[0:37:10] 1kenn1: kkoma lost his touch long time ago
[0:37:50] cTrix: But even if Faker is hardcarrying, he can't beat 5 people at once
[0:37:53] zewm: theory, what if SKT let Faker go, which team would best suit him?
[0:38:06] 1kenn1: any team with money
[0:38:12] zewm: no I mean player wise
[0:38:13] cTrix: Non of the top 5 teams probably
[0:38:15] 1kenn1: team liquid prob

[1:40:36] BabDab: FPX and blg both suck hurry it up so we can watch EDG
[1:40:38] SojuzSoju: @ZelgiusZero true, Duke would have been great as well, like there were quite a few players they coulda picked up it doesn't make sense why they would get three rookies, effort, thal and blossom, maybe Blossom is a monster? But one monster isn't going to solve skt's issues
[1:40:40] YouFoundTiannnnnnnnnnnnnn: It's bilibili gaming LUL

[1:41:10] ZelgiusZero: @SojuzSoju I don't really know what SKT's scouting part is doing to be honest, they got Effort/Untara/Thal and none of them even look promising. Maybe they look good in scrims but I don't really see it
[1:41:13] Zynos_AT: BILLY BILLY
[1:41:13] zewm: Robinustream that was the initial thing that strung me in, they picked non-meta champs and they were SUPER aggro. Really liked their playstyle and Hai was awesome back then
[1:41:14] sparkscrashing: I forever root for BLG’s opponent solely because of the super cringe name.
[1:41:15] 12gageyt: Billy billy billy
[1:41:16] WafflePoros: STOP
[1:41:20] SojuzSoju: @ZelgiusZero I mentioned Marin purely because with IgNar's aggressiveness, Marin's tp's combined with that would have made for some awesume plays

[1:41:50] Robinustream: but zyra ashe was meta
[1:41:50] ZelgiusZero: @SojuzSoju Marin's teleports are one of the better parts of his play, yeah, Duke's teleports were usually pretty bad
[1:41:51] WafflePoros: the caters are trolling us

[1:42:19] SojuzSoju: @ZelgiusZero also Marin spent an entire year shotcalling on afreeca freecs, which means he can fill that role that skt painfully needs filled

[4:15:02] korydallas: @IchRasiereHamster because its different and a lot of people dont like new changes they gotta adapt to
[4:15:03] cherishbunny: @IchRasiereHamster because it's unnecessary, the more they change the game the worse it becomes
[4:15:06] Valodercy: POGGERS
[4:15:08] freaxxx904: rage blade jax bnanaThink
[4:15:20] WacKGLooNy: Stopwatch also makes it harder to dive ADC early.

[4:15:49] TriHard_from_jamaica: stopwatch should have a gold benefit for upgrading it but not for selling it
[4:16:05] WacKGLooNy: You don't have to afk farm when you have stopwatch. You can go aggro with it also
[4:16:07] 醜いサカナ: and remove the reduced CD

[4:16:55] TriHard_from_jamaica: honestly though stopwatch isn't as bad as people make it seem
[4:16:57] Sayori_BibleThump: stopwatch giving players one 'get out of jail free card', if they use it correctly, imo is a good thing, after the 8.2 changes go through with the Inspiration tree I think it will be in a better place.

[4:17:48] Tsuhira: @Sayori_BibleThump there shouldn't be space for "get out of jail free" card in pro play, the game is meant so that when you make a bad play you can take advantage of it, not press a button and be good to go
[4:17:50] SojuzSoju: @Zynos_at cuz that's what I'd do LUL

[4:18:58] TarlashTEO: hextech on LB gives perma sustain
[4:18:59] ichrasieremaeuse: be patient
[4:19:09] Sayori_BibleThump: @Tsuhira I see that, though I feel they need more fallback for taking stopwatch, so that you HAVE to make a good play from it to make it viable otherwise other runes would outshine it
[4:19:11] TriHard_from_jamaica: everyone has stopwatches she has ridiculous delays and doesn't influence the game at all anymore in high elo
