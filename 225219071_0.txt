[2:21:58] BLG_worlds_2024: I hate bo1 because any team can get lucky and beat any team one time
[2:22:01] bruiserking: it doesnt
[2:22:03] cTrix: Bo1 takes all the competitive out of the formate and it becomes soloQ
[2:22:07] michaelsund: People crying about Bo1 when western teams struggle in groups BrokeBack
[2:22:08] bruiserking: ya
[2:22:12] grimrevolution: ask an eulcs person lol i have no idea
[2:22:16] Irvinggon1: the Na LCS is bo3 and we can entertain the public
[2:22:17] 현대화폐이론: I like Bo1 FeelsGoodMan
[2:22:21] bruiserking: if lck was bo1 itd be so fucked
[2:22:31] WafflePoros: @Arkn23 you had ties, don't aske me why. It was a shit format
[2:22:36] Linko98: You already have a month long worlds with bo1
[2:22:44] cTrix: If LCK was Bo1 SKT wouldn't be last place 4Head
[2:22:48] Muttnuffins: @turbokid1234 right now it is
[2:22:50] Linko98: You cant have bo3 at worlds
[2:22:52] bruiserking: worlds bo1 kinda triggered me tbh
[2:22:54] Zynos_AT: didn't NA LCS swap to BO1?
[2:22:56] Irvinggon1: @turbokid1234 but the season 2017
[2:23:04] bruiserking: even tho bo3 wud be crazy
[2:23:09] Arkn23: @arturomes rooThink rooBlank
[2:23:15] BotlikeX: EU and NALCS are BO1
[2:23:17] WafflePoros: @Zynos_at EU and NA did
[2:23:23] CYBERBOOLI__xD: BO5 IS POGGGERS
[2:23:24] Zynos_AT: yee right
[2:23:31] CYBERBOOLI__xD: BO3 LUL
[2:23:33] Muttnuffins: bo3 > bo1 > bo2
[2:23:35] bruiserking: bo5 makes my pant hard
[2:23:37] christmasiam: They did that's why TrashSM is last
[2:23:37] cTrix: I dont think NA is Bo!
[2:23:37] RyRyRobe: @turbokid1234 dood NA is bo1 double round robin
[2:23:43] dapper_tv: if gnar was good he could
[2:23:51] detectiverolls20s: why does Mouse always get GP
[2:23:54] CYBERBOOLI__xD: @nanlover96 SLOW DOWN LITTLE BOY
[2:23:56] christmasiam: NA is bo1
[2:24:00] RustyTheCaster: a question as old as time @detectivesharpshot
[2:24:05] dapper_tv: wtf is bo1
[2:24:06] WafflePoros: LCS is BO1
[2:24:07] cTrix: detectivesharpshot that's what Frostk said too
[2:24:14] BotlikeX: Both are BO1 double round robin.
[2:24:17] Arkn23: i still dont get behind this bo1 decision
[2:24:21] grimrevolution: @dapper_tv best of one
[2:24:21] DontTouchMyCaptainCrunch: TSM> SKT
[2:24:23] BLG_worlds_2024: I feel like bo99 is optimal to see who the true best team is
[2:24:26] bruiserking: @cyberbully_cx dont tell me what can and cant make my pant hard. all games to bo5 rn!!!!
[2:24:28] christmasiam: The only reason I'd think bo1 is more fun is because people give their best to win that one game but otherwise,there is no posibility to comeback if u lose 1 match
[2:24:33] n8dawg707: isnt kog lulu one of the strongest bot lanes in 8.1?
[2:24:40] OdinTW: LIDL moments forsenE
[2:24:41] WafflePoros: kog/lulu bo8EW
[2:24:45] cTrix: The true reason EU switched to Bo1 is because it's cheaper for Riot to produce
[2:24:50] IceQueenYukino: kog/lulu... SeemsGood
[2:24:50] michaelsund: With bo5 format old G2 would have won worlds Kappa
[2:24:53] armaann: why does frosk always refer to rw as a super team
[2:24:54] bruiserking: bo3 is best because it means more papasmithy 😍
[2:25:00] dapper_tv: bo1 and bo3 are all the same in the end
[2:25:01] bruiserking: :~)
[2:25:01] cTrix: not any bs about viewer retention or competitive integrity
[2:25:09] christmasiam: Merill cheap af
[2:25:15] scottoflorida2014: Problem with BO1 is that the best teams do not always win so maybe a regions best team doesn't make MSI or Worlds.
[2:25:17] DazyLave: mouse cs LUL
[2:25:19] Irvinggon1: @nanlover96 <3
[2:25:26] bruiserking: xx
[2:25:36] REKKLES_RETIRED_UZI_LULW: @ctrix we know riot doesn’t give a crap about competitive integrity
[2:25:43] OdinTW: reading books in 2018 LUL
[2:25:45] Munchinsteaks: is it just me or is everyone else hearing some random noise
[2:25:49] sorrythaturfat: @DazyLave still has more gold than gnar LUL
[2:25:54] Muttnuffins: @christmasiam its probably more stressful on players though since 1 teamfight mistake could potentially lose them points since they cant make a comeback in another game, and usually since there's so much risk they play safe metas which are boring
[2:25:57] bruiserking: ima say it tho. i miss doa :'(
[2:26:01] cTrix: Munchinsteaks that's the chinese casters in the background
[2:26:01] setjet1: KKona
[2:26:06] scottoflorida2014: @Munchinsteaks You hear the voices in my head too? freaky WutFace
[2:26:10] yuio3456: playoffs are bo5 how can the best team not make MSI unless they are not even top6 bo1?
[2:26:11] bruiserking: doa is such a classy caster
[2:26:14] cTrix: The NA casters aren't sound isolated
[2:26:16] BLG_worlds_2024: @munchinsteaks they're working on fixing the problem
[2:26:22] RyRyRobe: You still get enough playoff teams after bo1 to play bo5s for title best team
[2:26:25] Munchinsteaks: @CTrix it sounds like beeping not talking
[2:26:31] Zynos_AT: MrDestructoid
[2:26:34] Irvinggon1: the bo3 is so better for the players
[2:26:37] kusan4gi: is uzi still playing?
[2:26:42] bruiserking: its random feedback i think
[2:26:44] sorrythaturfat: injury
[2:26:47] christmasiam: take my seed
[2:26:49] grimrevolution: @RUSTYTheCASTER will you guys dress someone up in a dino costume again this year?
[2:26:50] cTrix: Munchinsteaks well it's the casters though idk what you're hearing
[2:26:55] detectiverolls20s: honestly if you can make top 6 that should be enough to set you up
[2:27:14] bruiserking: when bo3 is on lsxyzLotion lsxyzLotion lsxyzMmm
[2:27:20] warmtocharm: when NA LCS?
[2:27:21] RustyTheCaster: @grimrevolution haha that really depends
[2:27:28] RustyTheCaster: Every year someone has dressed up funny it's because they lost a bet
[2:27:34] IceQueenYukino: Bo1 is garbage format geared towards filthy casuals
[2:27:36] niemieckihc: TriHard
[2:27:39] WaylioWaylio: hello everyone
[2:27:49] Munchinsteaks: jd is good
[2:27:49] Irvinggon1: @nzsmite HeyGuys
[2:27:49] detectiverolls20s: i don't like bo1
[2:27:52] RustyTheCaster: I can only imagine given snake and LGD's current form bets will exist
[2:27:55] bruiserking: @rustythecaster get people to make more bets ;)
[2:27:56] grimrevolution: Oh please, that was so funny last year, Dom was hilarious
[2:27:57] OdinTW: LUL
[2:28:02] christmasiam: gnar poggers
[2:28:03] Kawhi_So_Serious: tahm is lovley

[2:28:14] RustyTheCaster: Don't jinx them detective
[2:28:16] bruiserking: lsxyzMmm
[2:28:18] Muttnuffins: @IceQueenYukino agreed, real fans wouldnt want bo1 for their teams and there probably arent any pros that like bo1 > bo3
[2:28:27] michaelsund: LUL BOTLANE FLANK
[2:28:32] RyRyRobe: I don’t like bo1s but you can’t say with 6/10 making playoffs bo5 that best team doesn’t win title
[2:28:34] cTrix: The botlane TP flank LUL
[2:28:42] sorrythaturfat: I enjoy watching Bo1s more
[2:28:51] sorrythaturfat: because I'm not a fan of any NA team
[2:28:56] KuroNeko0203: NA BARRIER
[2:29:00] cTrix: sorrythaturfat it's ok to be a casual :)
[2:29:05] roll1ng1: LUL 5vs 5 top
[2:29:07] sorrythaturfat: lol
[2:29:10] Zynos_AT: Kappa
[2:29:10] Arkn23: i actually think that if this is being hosted by riot it will get more viewers. my friend doesnt even know theres lpl
[2:29:12] Kawhi_So_Serious: @RUSTYTheCASTER should i make cookies?
[2:29:20] christmasiam: because you're fat @sorrythaturfat
[2:29:22] RustyTheCaster: @Arkn23 then let them know!
[2:29:26] RustyTheCaster: Best we can do right now friend :)
[2:29:28] sorrythaturfat: feelsbadman
[2:29:36] sorrythaturfat: fatshaming children over the internet
[2:29:39] bruiserking: riot should host the opl so it blows up more :~]
[2:29:40] detectiverolls20s: I'm waiting for KSV to play on my other monitor xD
[2:29:44] grimrevolution: yeah that's fine, i'm not really invested into any nalcs team either I tend to watch for certain players or just if i have downtime and it's on
[2:29:44] Arkn23: @RUSTYTheCASTER i did rooHappy
[2:29:47] OdinTW: 2 TPs LUL
[2:29:48] way1134: LUL U
[2:29:49] RustyTheCaster: proud of you
[2:29:51] sorrythaturfat: @nanlover96 ^^^^
[2:29:54] michaelsund: @Arkn23 but there is also LCK right now. Would be unfair to put a stream on the main channel
[2:29:58] christmasiam: BibleThump
[2:30:00] Irvinggon1: double tp LUL
[2:30:02] cTrix: Yeah it took FrostK to constantly talk about LPL at MSI and Worlds for me to actually realise LPL was worth watching LUL
[2:30:06] Ajelija: MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[2:30:16] warmtocharm: bo1 is so fast when u watch your favorite team just once
[2:30:17] Dagobert2424: thia ia tp FIESTA LUL
[2:30:22] bruiserking: aussie timezone makes me miss nalcs. lck n lpl are perf time
[2:30:23] RustyTheCaster: I think as casters we're doing all we can to get the league into the public eye but it's tough!
[2:30:24] Beetrayn: SaltyFrosk
[2:30:30] sorrythaturfat: LCK starting in 20 minutes?
[2:30:31] RustyTheCaster: I think we're the most entertaining league so it's a shame
[2:30:37] sorrythaturfat: :(
[2:30:38] GummiGrim: @sorrythaturfat Yes
[2:30:40] PapaSmithy: LPL SeemsGood
[2:30:49] Dagobert2424: yeah LPL best league
[2:30:50] Yetsumari: Riot is rebroadcasting EU LCS
[2:30:50] bruiserking: lpl is defs underappreciated
[2:30:51] Muttnuffins: Papa POGGERS
[2:30:56] GummiGrim: @PapaSmithy PogChamp
[2:30:56] Beetrayn: LPL riffNotBad
[2:30:57] Yetsumari: ?
[2:30:59] sorrythaturfat: im only here to watch RNG feed again :(
[2:31:01] CYBERBOOLI__xD: ya KNow GET MILLIONS VIEWS on panda right now
[2:31:05] detectiverolls20s: I think it's hard to spread the word because a lot of names in LPL are difficult to market.
[2:31:05] OdinTW: TBF i dont even know what LPL stands for forsenOMEGA
[2:31:06] kirin236: PapaSmity SeemsGood nowayLove
[2:31:07] bruiserking: problem is lck can never be because hypebeasts for kr
[2:31:08] grimrevolution: you guys are! the games are fun, the casters are great, and the players are so good, LPL is my favorite league by far
[2:31:10] uqcm: this is the most constructive chat i've seen
[2:31:11] detectiverolls20s: Most people don't care who Rookie is
[2:31:15] RustyTheCaster: @OdinTW guess
[2:31:15] Arkn23: @GiorgioMastrota_ i know. just wish they would advertise this channel more rooCry
[2:31:16] DazyLave: @PapaSmithy enjoying the kingzone?
[2:31:18] Kawhi_So_Serious: @RUSTYTheCASTER the time it is on is unfortunate, most of NA is asleep and you have to contend with LCK
[2:31:18] cTrix: Instead of hosting LPL Riot Games channel is rebroadcasting EU LCS to 16k viewers rooWhat
[2:31:22] sorrythaturfat: PandaTV has 500000 viewers I went to go check
[2:31:22] bruiserking: but i will admit im lck biased
[2:31:26] RustyTheCaster: @GoudjonDaniel correct
[2:31:51] bruiserking: its a shame lck and lpl are on same times
[2:31:57] detectiverolls20s: I like LCK games because they're cleaner a lot of the time.
[2:31:58] CYBERBOOLI__xD: @sorrythaturfat WAIT to RNG play GUARANTEE 2 MILLIONS
[2:31:59] OldManBog: i usually watch lpl over lck bc i dont have to wait 3 hours to watch a match here
[2:31:59] bruiserking: id like to get into lpl more
[2:32:01] 菁蛙: corki ANELE
[2:32:05] sorrythaturfat: :D
[2:32:06] bruiserking: might gdt into vods of it
[2:32:17] RustyTheCaster: @nanlover96 what type of teams do you like?
[2:32:18] DoctorSoftee: What rune is jog running?
[2:32:20] djjohnnymelster: I like lck
[2:32:25] sorrythaturfat: RNG
[2:32:29] RyRyRobe: LPL was on yesterday while LCK had day off...sadly Vici played
[2:32:31] djjohnnymelster: I just really don't like jin air games
[2:32:32] cTrix: LPL vods should be on youtube like any other region
[2:32:33] sorrythaturfat: only team ur allowed to like is RNG
[2:32:39] yuio3456: LCK has this dumb 1 hour break between best of 3s
[2:32:39] DoctorSoftee: What rune is kog running?
[2:32:40] RustyTheCaster: Kog is fleet footwork (Precision) and Inspiration secondary
[2:32:41] leon99671: you guys also getting many viewers on pandatv's english channel PogChamp
[2:32:45] GummiGrim: Kind of waiting for 8.2 to see if games start speeding up, games are 40+ minutes so often
[2:32:49] cTrix: @DoctorSoftee Fleet Footwork
[2:32:49] grimrevolution: excuse you, IG is hilarious to watch
[2:32:49] bruiserking: as in what are my fav teams? probably kz, and afreeca rn
[2:32:52] Kawhi_So_Serious: @RUSTYTheCASTER people just gotta watch lck and lpl at the same time hyphyRow
[2:32:54] n8dawg707: i watch lpl for we...and iBoy
[2:32:56] Irvinggon1: @doctorsoftee cleptomanci
[2:33:00] bruiserking: rec me any team ill ss and suss some vods homie
[2:33:06] Muttnuffins: i watch lpl inbetween lck games unless the teams i like are playing then ill just stay here
[2:33:11] djjohnnymelster: I watch lpl for snake :)
[2:33:11] detectiverolls20s: WE are fun to watch
[2:33:18] detectiverolls20s: How are EDG atm?
[2:33:20] christmasiam: LPL is much more interesting, there is so much action
[2:33:23] DoctorSoftee: Thank you Rusty. Looks different on LpL is it is fleet
[2:33:27] RustyTheCaster: @nanlover96 I'd agree with detective and say WE for your flavour fix
[2:33:31] n8dawg707: edg are 4-1, doing good
[2:33:34] byterover: LUL
[2:33:39] RustyTheCaster: But if you want an exciting team to watch, check out OMG
[2:33:43] KazumaRyuto: did vg beat edg?
[2:33:51] djjohnnymelster: they won 1 game
[2:33:52] 菁蛙: ANOTHER KOG WIN PogChamp
[2:33:56] uqcm: @Muttnuffins literally me
[2:33:57] 甜野的小迷妹: they took first game but lost the bo3
[2:34:00] bruiserking: ill check out OMG and WE games! thanks homies
[2:34:00] djjohnnymelster: because loong came back
[2:34:01] Dshecker: yea i fell asleep in IG vs EDG
[2:34:03] n8dawg707: they got 1 game off them but lost the bo3
[2:34:05] Dagobert2424: SNAKE
[2:34:05] RyRyRobe: Most of usual LPL top dogs doing well except RNG atm
[2:34:07] CYBERBOOLI__xD: @RUSTYTheCASTER NAH SNAKE is the HIGHLIGHT REEL
[2:34:07] Dshecker: did EDG win
[2:34:07] djjohnnymelster: but they got stomped the next too
[2:34:11] grimrevolution: rusty is biased to WE tho ;)
[2:34:17] RustyTheCaster: True.. actually you know what Snake is also good
[2:34:19] PBnJealous: it's funny you say that, Rusty. We can't check out OMG they are playing later LUL
[2:34:22] christmasiam: 0 commitment
[2:34:30] RustyTheCaster: I just forget about them, it's been so long since they were good
[2:34:31] bruiserking: snake on the list too :^)
[2:34:31] detectiverolls20s: I just like Mystic and Xiye
[2:34:47] n8dawg707: xiye Kreygasm hes probably my favorite player
[2:34:54] PoliticalMuffin: @RUSTYTheCASTER Do you have no faith in IG?
[2:34:56] bruiserking: i just wanna see bbq and mvp pop off in lck
[2:34:57] Kawhi_So_Serious: OMG is fun to watch, as long as they got icon they got me
[2:35:00] grimrevolution: a really good set of vods is the WE vs. IG playoff matches last split
[2:35:01] RustyTheCaster: For what it's worth @PBnJealous I did ask for us to show it!
[2:35:01] Dagobert2424: actually every team is exciting to watch except Vici LUL
[2:35:02] djjohnnymelster: I still remember that day they had to play 10 games in one day
[2:35:02] Arkn23: RNG, SKT, G2 LUL
[2:35:02] Dshecker: xiye so underrated internationally
[2:35:04] GummiGrim: I feel like most of the leagues seem more competitive instead of a clear divide between top and bottom teams
[2:35:10] detectiverolls20s: I think MVP is rip
[2:35:11] christmasiam: have his babies @h8dawg707
[2:35:13] djjohnnymelster: the last day of jay z :(
[2:35:19] RustyTheCaster: RIP JieZou
[2:35:21] plasticbeg: TSM LUL
[2:35:33] PBnJealous: @RUSTYTheCASTER I forgive you rusty, I'm sure this was Clements idea to not show OMG
[2:35:34] d3gvsdo: @RUSTYTheCASTER tbh, the best way to get more ppl into lpl would be to get highlight vids of the games on here/youtube. because i dont think most "potential viewers know the teams/players well enough to get excited
[2:35:42] lilaobayihun88: I want to see Ig vs EDG we vs rng
[2:35:53] Yogurtlel: @GummiGrim so everyone improved or the top team falled ?
[2:35:57] RustyTheCaster: @PoliticalMuffin iG is mega hype, was just recommending from the teams he watches in LCK!
[2:36:03] djjohnnymelster: I want to see IG vs Snake
[2:36:04] genioushero: @d3gvsdo +1
[2:36:07] Dshecker: MVP be that guy who trips SKT, the 2nd slowest guy running from the zombies LUL
[2:36:12] WafflePoros: @d3gvsdo the biggest problem is that LPL and LCK share the same timeslot
[2:36:18] GummiGrim: @Yogurtlel I think everyone improved, although some of the top teams look to be struggling
[2:36:27] CYBERBOOLI__xD: @RUSTYTheCASTER Does abyssal mask COUNTER KOG
[2:36:36] BLG_worlds_2024: another reason why LPL is the best? chat is civil af
[2:36:37] leon99671: EDG vs WE tomorrow PogChamp
[2:36:37] Dagobert2424: Galio unkillable already LuL
[2:36:38] GummiGrim: @Yogurtlel But I'm sure things will pick up by the end of the season
[2:36:38] bruiserking: i gotta find time to watch every lpl vod. maybe when im back from japan
[2:36:45] christmasiam: nice ulti LUL
[2:36:47] detectiverolls20s: Adaptive helm and ninja tabi counter Kog
[2:36:51] WafflePoros: @CYBERBULLY_CX adaptive helm helps agianst him
[2:36:51] RustyTheCaster: I would say Adaptive helm is significantly better vs Kog but Abyssal mask is a damage/tank hybrid item
[2:36:58] yuio3456: so many wasted flashes
