[4:52:58] IAteEighty8Pies: its a blink
[4:53:05] IAteEighty8Pies: not a dash
[4:53:07] grimrevolution: everything is a skillshot if ur bad enough
[4:53:12] LaoWai42: if anyone remembers the original champion spotlight lee sin's q was global
[4:53:12] sugarloww: blink indeed

[4:53:46] OscarIsMyName420: malz R is a skillshot i still need to practice FeelsBadMan
[4:53:51] grimrevolution: you have to click something for diana's r so not technically?
[4:53:51] RustyTheCaster: I could imagine if Lee Sin Q was
[4:53:57] grimrevolution: it's like shields
[4:54:04] IAteEighty8Pies: sadly they made a max dash range
[4:54:10] IAteEighty8Pies: for lee*
[4:54:17] IAteEighty8Pies: but someone like liss has the global tele
[4:54:17] Eier: chogath r should be global
[4:54:25] LaoWai42: @RUSTYTheCASTER the original lee sin's q was global promise
[4:54:27] grimrevolution: rip solo q
[4:54:34] SgtMurasa: lee sin's original spotlight was an april fool's joke
[4:54:37] RustyTheCaster: If Cho'Gath hits 15 stacks, his R becomes global
[4:54:40] siegfriedOG: azir R is a skillshot. imagine pushing 5 man to your fountain
[4:54:42] IAteEighty8Pies: Lol
[4:54:42] Zynos_AT: that'd be an indirect karthus R nerf though LUL we'd need to buff karthus then Kappa
[4:54:50] IAteEighty8Pies: LOL TRUE @gazoalphonse
[4:54:50] LaoWai42: @Sora656 shhh thats not important
[4:55:03] grimrevolution: if aatrox had a global jump he's be a cheaper galio
[4:55:04] IAteEighty8Pies: i still think blitz is the most op
[4:55:10] RustyTheCaster: yeah true blitz
[4:55:16] RustyTheCaster: that's like some wc3 pudge wars
[4:55:26] IAteEighty8Pies: lmao
[4:55:26] siegfriedOG: blitz q would take too long to arrive at target. i like my azir R better tbh
[4:55:31] IAteEighty8Pies: i loved that
[4:55:37] IAteEighty8Pies: azir has to hit 6 tho
[4:55:42] grimrevolution: gnar global q and ult

[5:15:03] grimrevolution: w yes thank you
[5:15:12] grimrevolution: lol i haven't played rakan in a while
[5:15:24] MdwdMw: 100% (6/6) PogChamp
[5:15:53] grimrevolution: but then, xayah's q would also be global
[5:15:54] Meghz: im scared to play ranked FeelsBadMan
[5:15:55] IAteEighty8Pies: ok i think top 3 are
[5:15:59] grimrevolution: xayah's ult?
[5:16:02] SgtMurasa: my ass ma Kreygasm
[5:16:06] IAteEighty8Pies: 1: Blitz 2: thresh 3: xerath
[5:16:06] Rudiko: rakan is just a bad alistar
[5:16:23] IAteEighty8Pies: rudiko but ali's w is targeted
[5:16:32] IAteEighty8Pies: so it wouldnt be global
[5:16:40] grimrevolution: i's do 1. aiggs 2. lux 3. thresh or blitz
[5:16:40] leon99671: EZ混
[5:16:42] MingLee_Man: Guys did IG win or LGD win ?
[5:16:46] grimrevolution: ziggs
[5:16:49] chou701: TTours
[5:16:52] grimrevolution: ig won 2-1
[5:16:56] IAteEighty8Pies: blitz is for sure #1
[5:17:01] IAteEighty8Pies: since lv 1 fountain pulls forever
[5:17:09] IAteEighty8Pies: and a free one pre 15 seconds
[5:17:12] grimrevolution: too many things in the way
[5:17:19] MingLee_Man: tks
[5:17:32] IAteEighty8Pies: just pulling minions would be op enough
[5:17:41] grimrevolution: yeah but after the first game he'd either be insta banned or people would flash to one side of the fountain and huddle there
[5:17:46] Meghz: SourPls
[5:18:00] IAteEighty8Pies: exactly
[5:18:08] IAteEighty8Pies: 100% pick or ban
[5:18:15] IAteEighty8Pies: also xerath>ziggs
[5:18:24] grimrevolution: rito would permaban him kappa
[5:18:26] IAteEighty8Pies: since his abilities other than e have no travel time
[5:18:42] IAteEighty8Pies: and q is aoe
[5:19:06] IAteEighty8Pies: also ziggs bouncing bomb would be a pain to land since the bounces would be HUGE
[5:19:14] IAteEighty8Pies: unlike the small bounces which make it easier
[5:19:15] grimrevolution: zigg's q would go forever and it's bounce just f's people up
[5:19:30] grimrevolution: maybe it's a lot of small bounces?
[5:19:37] grimrevolution: jesus we forgot zoe
[5:19:39] IAteEighty8Pies: LOL
[5:19:43] grimrevolution: 1) zoe

[5:19:53] IAteEighty8Pies: 1 is zoe/blitz
[5:20:01] IAteEighty8Pies: both are instant kills
[5:20:19] IAteEighty8Pies: also zoe's projectile is much slower than blitz's pull
[5:20:25] IAteEighty8Pies: since normally it relies on sleep
[5:20:32] grimrevolution: yeah but she can redirect it anywhere
[5:20:45] grimrevolution: and sleep is also a skillshot
[5:20:51] grimrevolution: so it would also be global
[5:20:51] IAteEighty8Pies: but if she uses that technique
[5:20:59] IAteEighty8Pies: she cant sent another q until she redirects
[5:21:20] IAteEighty8Pies: unlike blitz if you have 45% cdr you be spamming the pulls
[5:21:20] grimrevolution: they don't last very long, you have to do it quickly anyway

[6:04:41] itsAuroraTan: rng太吃uzi了

[6:04:58] tatsu824: 我懷疑現在uzi也不能解決問題
[6:05:05] TurbinePro: 反正lmslpl世界赛都出不了成绩 匿了 BibleThump
[6:05:09] itsAuroraTan: rng 乃至lpl最大的问题就是没强力上单
[6:05:15] Sad123happy: 不会吧，我同学里几个台湾人国语比香港人好多了
[6:05:17] tatsu824: RNG的狀態現在是全面崩

[6:05:29] 我先放个夹子马克一下: 卡萨刚进队伍，你让他带着队伍打？可能吗？他自己都不是这种打野，卡萨是控图型的打野
[6:05:34] itsAuroraTan: rng上路太菜了
[6:05:34] TurbinePro: lpl缺个狗狗赢
[6:05:34] YouFoundTiannnnnnnnnnnnnn: 你弄错了个问题。 是MLXG正常发挥搭配其他人就能赢，他发挥不好被反蹲RNG一定输。 这才是要karsa的原因。
[6:05:36] camelwink: Pulse will never get his champs xD
[6:05:54] tatsu824: 咖薩不是控圖型打野 安掌門才是
[6:05:58] TurbinePro: 话说狗狗赢现在干嘛去了，好像没卖肉松饼
[6:06:01] 我先放个夹子马克一下: 卡萨的地图控制比香锅好，但是他在RNG没有专门的战术体系

[6:06:36] 我先放个夹子马克一下: 卡萨看起来侵略是因为闪电狼的中单每局在线上能打出优势
[6:06:36] 国人晓迪: 咖萨一到LPL就哑火了

[6:07:59] Baltmoree: I guessed so, memers meeing
[6:08:00] 我先放个夹子马克一下: 你自己去看世界赛上，闪电狼的真眼和布眼是谁在做，做了多少，占全队比例

[7:32:53] siegfriedOG: the chinese audience also push the viewer counts of LCK
[7:32:55] scottoflorida2014: 61,000 on panda LOL stream
[7:32:58] iseesai: where is clearlove7

[7:33:38] skadanaa: @RUSTYTheCASTER whats the score
[7:33:38] scottoflorida2014: So it went up just since I checked it
[7:33:53] shenbot111: My friends in China says they watch the English stream because they want to practice English
[7:33:54] RustyTheCaster: 1-0 WE
[7:33:57] Distxnct_: SKT is ass this year
[7:34:02] shenbot111: And they hate the girl caster LUL

[7:34:13] scottoflorida2014: haha panda chat is flowing
[7:34:13] siegfriedOG: @RUSTYTheCASTER any chance to increase the game sound a little?
[7:34:14] buzhisuowei: BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack SKT
[7:34:27] leavesinwind: SK TRASH
[7:34:32] skadanaa: RNG > WE > EDG > IG
[7:34:32] Distxnct_: sumThump sumThump sumThump sumThump sumThump SKT
[7:34:33] グラビーファンズ: we! we!
[7:34:36] shenbot111: The girl caster according to them don’t know enough about the game and is very hard to be taken seriously
[7:34:41] RustyTheCaster: Is game sound low?
[7:34:50] iseesai: SKT≈RNG hahahahaha
[7:34:51] RustyTheCaster: @shennbot ah do they mean the chinese broadcast
[7:34:52] siegfriedOG: yeah is low
[7:34:56] leavesinwind: sound good
[7:35:01] グラビーファンズ: game sound quick low
[7:35:01] scottoflorida2014: haha Chinese LOL stream 545,000
[7:35:03] shenbot111: Yes rusty not frosk
[7:35:11] RustyTheCaster: Was gonna say haha
[7:35:13] Linko98: @coffeebeanbyme IG won 2-1
[7:35:15] shenbot111: Lmao
[7:35:19] scottoflorida2014: They love their esports
[7:35:33] siegfriedOG: i guess they mean frosk and if so, they definitely are wrong.
[7:35:39] siegfriedOG: nvm
[7:36:00] Rudiko: when 8.2 BibleThump
[7:36:05] shenbot111: Imo there are only 3-4 Chinese casters who are really good
[7:36:19] shenbot111: He others especially certain casters are unbearable
[7:36:25] RustyTheCaster: Chengmao, wawa/miller
[7:36:40] Two1u: 777777777777777777777777777777777
[7:36:43] shenbot111: Wawa is amazing
[7:36:50] siegfriedOG: @LPL1 can we increase game sound a little guys?
[7:37:03] scottoflorida2014: That's hard to watch with all the words going across the screen
[7:37:19] tatsu824: i think you can turn those off
[7:37:23] shenbot111: I love wawamiller and how patriotic they are, they’re always so proud when LPL wins internationally
[7:37:39] scottoflorida2014: OMG I cant read, it wasn't 500k its up to 6,000,000 viewers :O
[7:37:54] shenbot111: I think the viewer number on panda isn’t accurate
[7:37:58] KayneAlexander: game sound is too low. I cant hear ping
[7:37:58] RustyTheCaster: You can turn those off for sure
[7:38:03] leavesinwind: Good Chinese caster do live,because it means more money.
[7:38:05] shenbot111: But I’m sure the viewer count is still very high
[7:38:23] ZkLL: @rustythecaster raeWave
[7:38:54] RustyTheCaster: Yeah, I was looking at the chat speed to see if it was remotely accurate
[7:38:59] scottoflorida2014: @shennbot it keeps rolling up and up 6.1 million LUL
[7:39:00] RustyTheCaster: shave a % off but still the numbers are good
[7:39:26] shenbot111: It’s we and edg the number could reach over a million
[7:40:05] FBHeron: MAN I missed LCK today because I drank too much yesterday... but at least LPL is on hashSx
[7:40:23] scottoflorida2014: LCK is on
[7:40:32] emptyneuron: lck is boring
[7:40:32] scottoflorida2014: but ResidentSleeper
[7:40:35] KayneAlexander: POGGERS
[7:40:39] siegfriedOG: i don't understand the caitlyn pick tbh.
[7:40:46] Linko98: meiko PogChamp
[7:40:52] RustyTheCaster: Cait is picked to siege and win mid game :)
[7:40:56] RustyTheCaster: it's also a denial from mystic
[7:40:59] camelwink: iboy has a good winrate on cait too prer sure
[7:41:01] scottoflorida2014: LPL looks a lot stronger than LCK this year
[7:41:12] tatsu824: we gonna play from behind once again
[7:41:22] Rudiko: @scottofl2014 dont jinx it pls
[7:41:32] scottoflorida2014: LUL sorry
[7:41:35] FBHeron: Not sure I agree with that though, have you seen Kingzone?
[7:41:49] FBHeron: There's quite a lot of really really good teams in LCK still imo
[7:41:58] RustyTheCaster: How's audio now @gazoalphonse we touched it a little bit, I think casters were slightly too high volume not game sounds low
[7:41:59] coffeebeanbyme: im here for fiesta BlessRNG
[7:42:03] FBHeron: I do kinda prefer watching LPL play in terms of entertainment value though
[7:42:08] soundpraenk: LCK is still beter than LPL..
[7:42:19] ZelgiusZero: Kingzone is good but KSV is dropping games and looking messy vs mid-tier LCK teams
[7:42:22] scottoflorida2014: Yeah but overall I mean LPL looks stronger
[7:42:24] siegfriedOG: sound is fine now
[7:42:26] ZelgiusZero: KT also almost lost their series today
[7:42:27] shenbot111: You can’t say lck is better than LPL when LPL haven’t won anything major yet
[7:42:34] shenbot111: I love LPL but still
[7:42:36] 周姐輪: lol
[7:42:40] nfLeny: lck has papa casting tho
[7:42:43] tatsu824: if you take all teams into account LPL is actually better than LCK
[7:42:45] scottoflorida2014: Have to see what happens at Rift Rivals
[7:42:45] no_fly_zone7: hes saying lck is playing bad rn
[7:42:46] grimrevolution: *coughs* rift rivals
[7:42:50] G_ginin_der: wow
[7:42:58] shenbot111: Rift rival?
[7:42:58] scottoflorida2014: I agree @tatsu824 this year
[7:42:59] skadanaa: LPL > LCK > LMS > EU > NA
[7:43:05] tatsu824: but since you can only send 3 teams to worlds i would say lck still takes the advantage
[7:43:05] no_fly_zone7: lck is featring players that arent even using gp w on stuns
[7:43:07] leavesinwind: 14 teams
[7:43:08] RustyTheCaster: I'd neeever say LPL is better than LCK if we look at top 3 teams, but heck I'd rather watch LPL for 4th-14th place
[7:43:11] shenbot111: NA won rift rival but they still suck
[7:43:11] Rudiko: I feel bad for papasmithy, he has to cast way too many games
[7:43:12] scottoflorida2014: Doesn't LPL play LCK at RR?
[7:43:14] siegfriedOG: @shennbot you are right there, but i remember RNG always being solid in international stage
[7:43:26] grimrevolution: i'm excited for rift rivals this year, it'll be interesting for sure
[7:43:27] soundpraenk: LPL looks stronger overall? last worlds, SKT was so bad they almost lost to Misfits and still was able to easily clap RNG and now looks how SKT is doing :)
[7:43:31] siegfriedOG: also EDG
[7:43:32] skadanaa: RNG > SKT, LZ, SSG, KT
[7:43:36] Rudiko: @shennbot rift rivals LUL
[7:43:48] FBHeron: @RUSTYTheCASTER Yeah, that's basically how I feel about it too - the top of LCK looks fantastic IMO, but yeah, the rest of the region looks kinda shakey at best
[7:43:48] scottoflorida2014: Nothing shows whos better than Rift Rivals head to head
[7:43:55] siegfriedOG: but i'm talking about that RNG with uzi in roster
[7:43:58] Dagobert2424: yeah LPL is the most exciting league to watch and I think they will do great internationally this year
[7:43:59] Rudiko: @arnej35 3-2 is easy clap?
[7:44:00] tatsu824: PogChamp
[7:44:01] leavesinwind: LJL？
[7:44:13] RustyTheCaster: did Xiye flash? o.o
[7:44:17] soundpraenk: @rudiko if you consider how bad SKT is, yes
[7:44:17] MdwdMw: PogChamp
[7:44:17] shenbot111: Holy shit scout
[7:44:20] lilaobayihun88: Why is LPL watching so few people BibleThump

[7:45:06] nfLeny: why we hear chinese casters as wellcmonBruh
[7:45:14] scottoflorida2014: ZOE is underpowered needs a buff
[7:45:25] pnkuU: because theyre in the same stadium @nfLeny
[7:45:30] Dagobert2424: they released Zoe after nerving Nidalee and Reworking Leblanc LUL
[7:45:35] grimrevolution: i think you just tilted me @scottofl2014
[7:45:40] scottoflorida2014: haha
[7:45:45] Rudiko: @nfleny and beside each other as well
[7:45:51] scottoflorida2014: Did they even do anything with ZOE with 8.2?
[7:46:09] shenbot111: No
[7:46:14] MingLee_Man: Balanced

[7:47:57] scottoflorida2014: Yes mushroom power
[7:48:05] one_more_plz: 3 losing lanes NotLikeThis
[7:48:07] FBHeron: I kinda put Teemo in that category that Zoe, Yasuo etc are in: Fun to play but really not very fun to play against, even if they're good or bad
[7:48:36] grimrevolution: nice! i know people don't play him in competitive because he's pretty easily countered by a team

[7:54:56] RustyTheCaster: i'm actually very tilted
[7:55:02] RustyTheCaster: by edg not picking it up
[7:55:05] tatsu824: 20 min in only 1 kill ResidentSleeper
[7:55:06] leavesinwind: He cant dead
[7:55:08] RustyTheCaster: I hope their coach grabs the belt
[7:55:13] Dagobert2424: is this a replay of game 1? LUL
[7:55:18] ZkLL: We all are
[7:55:27] goblinguy01: How did EDG throw game 1? I missed the ending
[7:55:29] siegfriedOG: LCS Malaysia > LPL
[7:55:35] camelwink: this is a wonderful game
[7:55:46] goblinguy01: When World Elite had 0 inhibs down, I thought they lost
[7:55:49] grimrevolution: at least MLXG went in to go get it again when the buff was left right outside the pit
[7:55:55] grimrevolution: edg just LEFT IT THERE
[7:55:56] camelwink: one aa off last nexus turret, iboy got caught out and then we got baron gg

[7:57:25] grimrevolution: elder dragon team strikes again?
[7:57:34] siegfriedOG: League of bugs
[7:57:58] RustyTheCaster: Zoe E cooldown is honestly so low it's not ok
[7:58:17] Rudiko: and Haro fails smite, get this guy out of here NotLikeThis
[7:58:20] camelwink: isnt it only low if it lands?
[7:58:37] siegfriedOG: nice replay, didnt show the bug LUL
[7:58:46] Meechi: Can I get a list of what was banned?
[7:58:50] FBHeron: Not really, Camel, because CDR is too easily accessible she ends up with a very low cooldown on such an influential spell anyway
[7:59:07] no_fly_zone7: TEAM WE SHOULD JUST BE DELETED
[7:59:10] RustyTheCaster: If someone walks over the bubble, she can throw another bubble at you before you're awake
[7:59:11] FBHeron: I also honestly have no idea why it travels through walls Bard-Tunnel style. I'm pretty sure that just got tacked on to reuse the code hashThink
[7:59:13] RustyTheCaster: lets put it that we
[7:59:14] no_fly_zone7: WTF IS THIS
[7:59:17] RustyTheCaster: way*
[7:59:20] grimrevolution: oh jeeze i only remember j4 and sej being banned
[7:59:37] Meechi: Xayah, kog, sej, j4 and?
[7:59:55] Erwten: kamil
[8:00:05] camelwink: ahhh ;-;
[8:00:11] camelwink: braum was banned
[8:00:18] Meechi: Do you think a trist pick would've been nicer to compliment Jax PTA
[8:00:30] Dagobert2424: if WE makes a comeback again EDG will tilt off their seats LUL
[8:00:31] camelwink: team we more like team waveclear
[8:00:32] greece_debt5: cmonBruh
[8:00:34] Meechi: If they are playing the turtling game again
[8:00:53] grimrevolution: kalista camille vlad illaoi j4 zac braum xayah sej and kog
[8:01:01] grimrevolution: those were the bans
[8:01:02] Meechi: Thanks
[8:01:10] tatsu824: turrets 6-0 LUL
[8:01:22] siegfriedOG: and still WE willw in
[8:01:26] elcab0ng: blue smite DansGame
[8:01:31] Meechi: This is still 8.1 though?
[8:01:47] lilaobayihun88: yea
[8:01:47] grimrevolution: yeah
[8:01:47] ZelgiusZero: yeah 8.1
[8:01:54] grimrevolution: won't be 8.2 until tomorrow
[8:01:55] tatsu824: i dont see varus being that strong in late game tho
[8:02:04] Meechi: Varus falls off late game
[8:02:16] Meechi: versus hyper carry late game cait
[8:02:17] grimrevolution: he shreds tanks pretty well though
[8:02:20] siegfriedOG: varus does not falls off late game, thats bs. but caitlyn does!
[8:02:30] FBHeron: It's really not that big a falloff. His basic abilities fall off but his R pick potential and damage with the onhit definitely doesn't.
[8:02:36] Rudiko: @meechiplz caiy
[8:02:36] ZelgiusZero: Varus is a good tank shredder and he can clear waves really well with runaans
[8:02:38] Linko98: cait late is really strong
[8:02:48] Meechi: Cait late is ridiculous
[8:02:52] grimrevolution: i'd pick varus over cait in a late game team fight
[8:02:54] FBHeron: You're not gonna see him one-shotting people with his Q or E but with the current meta build for him it's notmuch of a falloff at all imo
[8:02:56] Rudiko: @meechiplz caitlyn hyper carry nice joke LUL
[8:02:59] camelwink: they changed cait stats a while back to make her late game
[8:03:05] Meechi: the only reason she isn't played at least in ranked solo queue is because she can't make it to late game
[8:03:18] RustyTheCaster: holy zoe
[8:03:20] Meechi: Do you not see this pressure that she puts alone?
[8:03:23] siegfriedOG: varus will runaans hurricane, and lately shredd whole enemy team in 2 seconds
[8:03:28] tatsu824: almost zoe almost
[8:03:32] RustyTheCaster: HOLY ZOE

[8:04:29] グラビーファンズ: they like the new champ~
[8:04:37] tatsu824: turns out first picking azir into zoe is not a wise choice
[8:04:41] siegfriedOG: ofc we can talk about which team outscale, which adc is better ect, but who the flag is zoe?
[8:04:45] grimrevolution: except in the lpl apparently where every team leaves her open
[8:04:50] MaiaralNL: NotLikeThis L'OREAL NotLikeThis
[8:04:51] FBHeron: Can we just send Zoe straight back into a disney film and quietly leave her out of League of Legends?
