[2:08:56] grimrevolution: because the lpl has 14 teams and they want all of them to play on the patch a certain amount of times
[2:09:04] GummiGrim: I think they'll update the patch once the "week" of games is over
[2:09:05] Machrus: riot are testing 8.2 out on the bad regions first before moving onto the important regions
[2:09:08] scribundis: @machrus was talking about his ez build, he went crit items at about 85 mins in
[2:09:09] NA_REKT_IN_WEEK2: Jax with 612 damage LUL
[2:09:15] toxicxradiation: what patch are they playing on

[2:09:56] toxicxradiation: skt mental boom...wolf practicing jungle but then go support
[2:10:05] Thiazine: there's a long break after this week, so it makes sense to stay on 8.1 rather than just be on 8.2 for three days and switch to 8.4 or w/e it is when the break is over
[2:10:07] goblinguy01: Jin Air 90 minutes 20 kills
[2:10:10] thehermatron: @1kenn1 yea I think so

[2:10:44] doctor9h: I ALWAYS SAID THAT KKOMA WAS OVERRATED BUT THE AVERAGE PLEB DIDNT LISTEN
[2:10:44] goblinguy01: China 1 kill/minute LUL
[2:10:47] zifirt: oh okay

[2:10:55] DrHonker: i heard skt was paid off to thtow games to build views then they play serious for summer
[2:10:58] GummiGrim: @whytoday123 Still 8.1
[2:11:08] IceQueenYukino: @MY_FIORA_SMASHES_DIAMONDS yeah but i read like a couple weeks ago something abotu wolf too, but it was just a reddit comment lol
[2:11:10] tatsu824: alright karsa time to do something
[2:11:11] GummiGrim: Wouldn't they lose views if they keep losing 🤔
[2:11:17] arekilleeen: @drhonker same
[2:11:19] 藍色髮夾: wait so does skt has more 8.1 games left to play?
[2:11:23] djjohnnymelster: I think the zero damage jungers was like afreeca vs kz
[2:11:28] why_today: tq@gummigrim
[2:11:30] NA_REKT_IN_WEEK2: @GummiGrim hmm, btw anyone remember that IG_Kid had a 443 dmg game with Vayne ?
[2:11:37] GummiGrim: I'm pretty sure it will be 8.2 when games start again on Tuesday
[2:11:38] scribundis: No, LCK is 8.2 in week 4
[2:11:41] LyusheN: @ceedfire It's actually next Tuesday, sry, mb, i'm not a native speaker)) Good day Sir

[2:12:17] zifirt: well tbh i've been mocking with 50 mins 3k damage electrocute jarvan since the season began, in this meta junglers don't do shiet
[2:12:18] scribundis: SKT fans maybe?
[2:12:21] trus5: @DrHonker SSG and Longzhu still top 🤔

[2:13:07] IceQueenYukino: NA Fakers confirmed FeelsBadMan
[2:13:12] NA_REKT_IN_WEEK2: @grimrevolution KonCha
[2:13:13] 1kenn1: even if you do well the MVP always go to faker
[2:13:33] why_today: faker just want a team tocarry them
[2:13:34] IceQueenYukino: easyhoon is the real mvp in my heart when he was on skt FeelsBadMan
[2:13:41] GummiGrim: @thiazine I mean, just one long sword or going Pickaxe would let him last hit
[2:13:42] zifirt: if u want mvp u have to do better, not well
[2:13:45] why_today: him*
[2:13:45] NA_REKT_IN_WEEK2: I can't believe SKT could lose to MVP, the 0-10 team LUL
[2:13:47] OdinTW: double shield metar
[2:13:48] DrHonker: eh, i dont like skt and its super oring seeing them win everything, but you gotta remmeber spring means literally nothing thrn summer happens and skt is back in top 2 at worlds a d the the bandwagon fans and everyone says they always believed etc etc
[2:13:50] 阿喵喵的秘密男友: where is Karsa?
[2:13:57] KamuroStation: oh this is 8.1 monkaS
[2:14:03] ceedfire: @nattmannen What do you mean, LCK has some spicy things, Poppy, Sion, Zilean, Riven, and many more
[2:14:03] grimrevolution: he's actually playing
[2:14:04] lul4headxd: SKT is paying their top and jg chump change thts why huni and peanut left

[2:14:12] cosmicdeliverer: sad it'S still 8.1 xD
[2:14:14] 1kenn1: Spring was no competition everyone was rebuilding their roster
[2:14:23] lilaobayihun88: Karsa is sleepwalking
[2:14:35] Thiazine: @GummiGrim tear and sheen are priority for ez in pro play while cait straight up builds ad and crit

[2:15:15] DrHonker: yo, im fine if skt dynasty is gone and KZ or ssg take over, but i cant take spring seriously and i dont think the big teams do either
[2:15:16] FEBI_SIM_CARD_WAS_STOLEN: the reason the skt games are the best is when they are getting sht on and they get 1 kill or 1 tower all the skt fanboys in the chat act like they're back
[2:15:19] why_today: this mean the need a plan to change the meta to their side
[2:15:20] scribundis: If blank gets his shit together they have a chance
[2:15:24] GummiGrim: @thiazine Yeah, I'm aware it's standard. But it is a route that doesn't really interfere with build path considering it goes to Triforce or Manamune
[2:15:25] grimrevolution: he's napping cause he'd tired of people asking that question
[2:15:28] Machrus: @yasseroxi thats why they lost to edg right
[2:15:32] why_today: not following others
[2:15:34] 삼도천심해어: EDG just beat WE though Jebaited
[2:15:37] azu13u: lel

[2:19:22] tatsu824: 50 cs lead LUL
[2:19:22] dmr_grimmwolf: @GummiGrim Yeah but just looking at BLG lineup mercs makes more sense to me because theyve got bigger AP threats over AD, just imo
