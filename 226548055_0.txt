[1:51:11] IceQueenYukino: 292 viewers FeelsBadMan
[1:51:28] mujarshad: yes
[1:52:05] 69TV: it is chinese new year, which is big in China, hence the clothes
[1:52:12] RedPandaNyx: What is the LPL anyway? Strange competition- all the teams compromised and renamed- takeover of broadcast, and not all games are even telecast
[1:52:36] RedPandaNyx: Big in China, of course
[1:54:30] 69TV: there is another twitch channel for the games that are not on LPL1, it's opl_casting
[1:55:44] RedPandaNyx: Unfortunately League e-sports is becoming increasingly unwatchable and near impossible to follow for those who don't have time to constantly play it
[1:57:01] whaleOwO: Can we play DODOSIN ???
[1:57:11] GLPhoenix: Not sure about that one... I barely play anymore but I still watch a whole bunch of the esports side of things... but thats jujst me i guess

[1:59:04] whaleOwO: no viewers when frosk is not here Kappa
[1:59:13] RedPandaNyx: Was the LPL viewership all on Elon's 3rd booster rocket that missed its landing and plummeted at over 500kmph into the ocean?
[1:59:36] binxtor: ResidentSleeper
[1:59:45] Stay_Hydrated_Bot: @lpl1 You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[2:24:04] mujarshad: TOP has no hope, they might as well have some fun then
[2:24:29] Mishimatic: If you gotta go out, go out in style
[2:24:39] Laphx: hey i'm not complaining , just watched a 70+ min sivir/azir stall by skt only to lose anyway LUL
[2:24:44] Laphx: this is refreshing
[2:24:57] RedPandaNyx: back from LCK- 100min+ game2 ties SKT-BBQ series
[2:25:09] goblinguy01: Top and BLG able to finish game 1 before BBQ/SKT fiesta
[2:25:31] RedPandaNyx: It just felt like 100+ mins
[2:25:35] Woozie_9: varus no flash LUL
[2:25:48] Laphx: they all do tbh
[2:25:51] goblinguy01: LPL isnt a clown fiesta like LCK Kappa
[2:25:59] Laphx: sivir azir is just ResidentSleeper
[2:26:22] mujarshad: in lpl they would just dive a turret if they had to play slow for more than 2 minutes
[2:26:23] goblinguy01: Sivir solo defended two lanes :^
[2:26:40] RedPandaNyx: Right, good we don't see any fiestas in LPL
[2:26:46] goblinguy01: ^^ Its whu LPL is great to watch
[2:27:06] goblinguy01: Lets not talk about Snake/LGD throw fest
[2:27:06] sauvkb: lpl IS the clown fiesta
[2:27:20] narvuntien: Road doesn't die!
[2:27:23] goblinguy01: NA is a clown fiesta

[2:27:36] lilaobayihun88: top FailFish

[2:28:44] Woozie_9: that khazix had balls
[2:28:45] Laphx: o that's embarrassing
[2:29:06] goblinguy01: At least Kha did something even though he threw the game
[2:29:59] BaldursDottir: ytes, truck
[2:30:06] Dzy3D: what was the reasoning for riv jg?
[2:30:28] Areselmago: RIVEN JGL LUL
[2:30:43] Areselmago: @Dzzy23 soloQ worked 4Head
[2:30:43] mujarshad: they wanted to fake them out into thinking it was a counter to GP
[2:30:44] Senpai_is_back_: get good in
[2:30:56] instapyro33: Solo OMEGALUL
[2:31:08] Dzy3D: but riv is the soloQ toplane counter to gp i dont understand it coming from the jg lol
[2:31:35] Laphx: it's china my man
[2:31:43] Dzy3D: kuupoLUL
[2:31:44] Laphx: they do whatever the fuck they want
[2:31:54] Christodoulopoulos: riven counter gp LUL Kappa
[2:31:57] Dzy3D: that explains it well enough lol
[2:32:02] mujarshad: TOP is a bottom team, they have no hope of winning using standard strategies
[2:32:07] goblinguy01: Will SKT even make it to Rift Rivals?
[2:32:24] bigface128: wait what why is there a Riven Jungle
[2:32:28] RedPandaNyx: @goblibguy01 No, I don't think so
[2:32:33] goblinguy01: Riven PogChamp
[2:32:38] Dzy3D: we dont know the reasoning
[2:32:38] Mishimatic: TOP vs Golden Guardians at Rift Rivals 2018
[2:32:40] Woozie_9: Z LUL E
[2:32:47] Dzy3D: assuming yolo cheese
[2:33:03] Pruniey: does winning with zoe even count as winning? lel
[2:33:05] RedPandaNyx: Faker's no doubt skilled, but trying to hold SKT together on his own mostly
[2:33:10] mujarshad: riven jg 1v9 PogChamp
[2:33:14] goblinguy01: @redpandanyx There is no way Korea wins Rift Rivals if the top 4 teams goes. Korea lives off SKT's skill
[2:33:22] 日狗少年史大彪: 都跑去世界第二联赛了，我第一赛区没人看
[2:33:30] Woozie_9: Kreygasm
[2:33:39] goblinguy01: What has KT done for Korea?
[2:33:43] goblinguy01: Nothing
[2:33:52] RedPandaNyx: Well, Korea might just have to get used to the idea of no SKT
[2:33:57] bigface128: really looking forward to KT getting annihilated by KZ later today, if the SKT series ever ends
[2:34:02] Cindella: sam jackson “go the fuck to sleep”
[2:34:21] 69TV: @RedPandaNyx they should stop selling off their jungler and top every year
[2:34:22] Mishimatic: @bigface128 check back in 2 hours time
[2:34:50] Laphx: @bigface128 you obviously don't watch lck often, KT won't be annihilated by KZ
[2:35:00] bigface128: PapaSmithy almost going insane at the thought of another 90min game was thr highlight of last game
[2:35:00] lilaobayihun88: LCK, there's so many people watching so many people watching LCK lose
[2:35:02] RedPandaNyx: Yeah, SKT at the top for so long- every team has to undergo generational change. Wonder how long Faker will go on for
[2:35:08] n1357: BrokeBack
[2:35:14] Laphx: KT will make it seem like they can win, they'll get close enough to make you believe in them, and then they'll choke and throw it all away
[2:35:29] bigface128: @iammeni I fully believe in Deft's ability to choke in key teamfights and die
[2:35:38] RedPandaNyx: @bigface128 Yeah, PapaSmithy constantly saying "but, what does it meaannn" lol
[2:35:51] Laphx: every KT series against a top team i wait for the patented deft flash
[2:36:54] bigface128: Score and Smeb elohelled worse than Faker this season feelsbad
[2:37:11] mujarshad: no
[2:37:19] lilaobayihun88: Get it over with. I want to see Ig play UnSane UnSane
[2:37:58] Laphx: they aren't elo helled lol, the only questionably skilled player on that team is pawn, everyone else is fine... besides scores smiting skills
[2:38:10] mujarshad: pawn is good
[2:38:16] mujarshad: wtf
[2:38:20] bigface128: and Deft choking every. single. game. that matters
[2:38:28] mujarshad: every on kt is good
[2:38:31] Laphx: pawn is probably the weakest member on KT
[2:38:33] mujarshad: everyone on kt is good*
[2:38:45] lilaobayihun88: top vs vg LUL LUL LUL
[2:38:58] mujarshad: one team has to win BlessRNG
[2:39:04] Laphx: but he's the weakest, and probably the only non top 3 in his role in korea on his team
[2:39:09] Laphx: that's all i'm saying about pawn, he's still good
[2:39:17] Laphx: just not top 3 mid
[2:39:21] reyzyyllow: VG disband
[2:39:23] taorecife: catilin nao tem dano aff
[2:40:10] mujarshad: i dunno, Pawn is really consistent and he performs well on most of the meta picks
[2:40:12] RedPandaNyx: Gold lead is a number higher than 10 and less than 15. Go Rusty, Go!
[2:40:19] lilaobayihun88: @sxstinns WutFace
[2:40:30] Laphx: faker, bdd, crown all better than pawn
[2:40:43] Laphx: again not that he's bad, just not top 3
[2:41:12] 69TV: Kassadin :D
[2:41:18] bigface128: Pawn is... consistent, but if he can't pop off and Deft chokes as per usual the team is in deep trouble vs better teams
[2:41:19] mujarshad: a good ryze is so nice to watch Kreygasm
[2:41:32] Laphx: agreed
[2:41:38] mujarshad: KZ is the only team that is better right now

[3:53:28] balu0919: i d fock de shet out of this grill
[3:53:49] cristhian613: I love Uefa champions league from eu

[3:54:05] Laphx: it's only natural for them to also have higher viewership numbers
[3:54:06] YourH1GHness: Yeah so would I @balu0919
[3:54:11] BabDab: iG has won 13 of their last 14 games

[3:58:52] keebao: syndra interesting LUL
[3:58:56] edgelordweeb: @onlywatchlol probably because of RNG’s success with an all Chinese roster and because with franchising orgs can take risks with new talent
[3:59:01] tatsu824: theshy earned his fame for streaming soloq riven so i do miss some crazy picks in pro games
[3:59:40] vilfortt: chinese version of in da club
[3:59:42] Laphx: if you want to see riven go watch blg vs top
[3:59:49] Stay_Hydrated_Bot: @lpl1 You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:52] Laphx: they picked unsealed spellbook riven jungle and it got smashed
[4:00:03] balu0919: @vilfortt LUL XD
[4:00:09] Dagobert2424: LUL

[4:01:18] Komemos: 8.1 DansGame
[4:01:36] thegirlismine: last 8.1
[4:01:40] jfr00sh: who won blg vs top?
[4:01:51] edgelordweeb: @jfr00sh who do you think
[4:01:52] Komemos: BLG
[4:01:52] BabDab: iG has a ton of poke with a janna, this game is gonna be cancer
[4:01:52] Dagobert2424: BLG
[4:01:54] Laphx: top won
[4:01:57] jfr00sh: blg?
[4:02:08] lilaobayihun88: @komemos Yes 8.2 after the year of China
[4:02:12] tatsu824: VAC
[4:02:13] edgelordweeb: Yeah BLG won
[4:02:23] thegirlismine: top never top
[4:02:25] BabDab: If you combine their score Top and VG are 2-28
[4:02:39] Komemos: @lilaobayihun88 yeah I know ^^ just those relic shield are annoying, even the last day FailFish
[4:02:52] Laphx: that's a pretty standard flag
[4:02:59] lilaobayihun88: Lpl28 minutes, game over, then LCK LUL
[4:03:00] Laphx: yes???
[4:03:30] Laphx: you may laugh
[4:03:47] Laphx: but korean teams are still by far better than lpl teams
[4:03:47] thegirlismine: hahah BrokeBack
[4:04:05] Dagobert2424: nah this year LPL will win worlds
[4:04:06] YourH1GHness: How can you say thst
[4:04:12] YourH1GHness: It’s clearly not true
[4:04:13] thegirlismine: lpl more commercial
[4:04:18] Laphx: i can say it easily and confidently
[4:04:23] BabDab: they weren't even by far better last year, WE and RNG were very close to SKT and LZ, only Samsung was far ahead
[4:04:28] tatsu824: same discussion has been brought up before
[4:04:41] Laphx: prove me wrong my man, feel free
[4:04:53] Komemos: @Jmw3000 it is 100% true, look at the game that will be played KT vs KZ
[4:04:58] edgelordweeb: @babdab even that is questionable, SSG got 2-0’d by RNG in groups
[4:05:00] Dagobert2424: dude we cant proove anybody wrong untill MSI LUL
[4:05:08] BabDab: Honestly by the end of the year I think this iG has the potential to be on par with the best in Korea, they need to work very hard though\
[4:05:16] Komemos: @iammeni I got your back buddy LCK > LPL
[4:05:24] lilaobayihun88: FailFish FailFish
[4:05:29] FlashbackKO: LUL LUL
[4:05:47] Velthrick: " That's my First Blood " rooDerp
[4:05:54] tatsu824: i think lpl as a whole is better but since you can only send 3 teams to worlds lck still has the edge over lpl
[4:06:06] edgelordweeb: If only his name was still Pinus
[4:06:15] MisakiKureha: @iammeni well koreans are koreans man so no wonder
[4:06:16] Laphx: SSG wasn't even good last year to korean standards, anyone who watched could tell you that, SSG just countered LZs playstyle and SKT started their downfall
[4:06:42] tatsu824: i agree on that
[4:06:53] BabDab: SSG is a team that has hot and cold spots
[4:06:56] lilaobayihun88: I want to see theshy vs kihan UnSane UnSane
[4:07:00] BabDab: they were hot at worlds
[4:07:08] Komemos: SKT won't make it to the worlds this year so no point to use them for comparison anymore :(
[4:07:14] thegirlismine: just after MSI and S8 know result. maybe eu best BrokeBack
[4:07:17] Laphx: SSG is just consistent and okay
[4:07:24] Laphx: or ksv now i guess
[4:07:33] 我先放个夹子马克一下: SKT win or not ?
[4:07:35] BabDab: I'll never call them ksv
[4:07:39] BabDab: you cant make me call them ksv
[4:07:41] Laphx: cuvee is a pumpkin, ambition is on his last legs, crown is alright, ruler is okay, corejj is okay
[4:07:50] Laphx: overall they're.... okay
[4:07:50] tatsu824: the shy FailFish

[4:53:31] vilfortt: IG didnt seem very focused last game
[4:53:37] camelwink: yea i dont think counterpicks really matter in low elo
[4:54:08] camelwink: @KingH3RSH3Y meme that fpx beats top team and bottom team only
[4:54:13] BabDab: IG's draft was horrible last game
[4:54:17] Senpai_is_back_: well neither do they matter really here
[4:54:41] BabDab: they got cancer zoe and cancer braum this time so it should be way better

[5:01:48] flaava: this caitlyn gonna carry so hard
[5:01:53] BabDab: stopwatch is pure cancer
[5:02:04] BabDab: whoever makes the aggressive play always loses because they get stopwatched and then theyre out of position
[5:02:33] edgelordweeb: LPL uses stopwatch to play aggro a lot
[5:02:44] Laphx: it's only a cody sun if he also ints at the same time
[5:02:52] BabDab: yeah it's also cancer for tower dives
[5:03:08] BabDab: stop watch is dumb in so many different ways
[5:03:43] BabDab: the worst part is you know riot wont properly nerf it until after MSI because that's how they do things
[5:03:46] edgelordweeb: I only like stopwatch because it makes playing against assassins so much less aids on immobile mid laners
[5:03:56] flaava: z LUL e monkaS
[5:04:10] thegirlismine: poor bing
[5:04:20] ceedfire: yes and no, stopwatch is to strong 8.2 but it allows to play champions that would otherwise get permadove, on the flipside it enables dives, stopwatch reduces tower impact early in the game, which is cool I think, rune is good, just to strong
[5:04:32] DrunkLegoPeople: at least you cant take the free boots rune with stopwatch anymore
[5:05:19] BabDab: the biggest problem with stopwatch is it encourages either passive play or multi man tower dives with no inbetween, standard 2v2/1v1 in lane is so much riskier now
[5:05:36] Linko98: What do you get instead of boots now?
[5:05:38] BabDab: because if you go aggressive and they stopwatch suddenly you're out of position
[5:05:53] Laphx: so i get that leesin is classic lpl... but why pick lee sin? did he get like 6 jg bans towards him?
[5:05:56] ThiefOfTime49: Again LOL

[5:06:31] Laphx: that's why people pay to buy her and her skin
[5:06:34] BabDab: There were jungle bans but lee is a strong pick in LPL, if you're skilled hes good

[5:09:04] Vodakhun: oh true
[5:09:06] dajja3: 8.2
[5:09:13] dajja3: ?
[5:09:21] ceedfire: Targon on adc / Sightstone / Bottom left panel -> It's 8.1
[5:09:24] Laphx: it's 8.1, the patch is on the bottom left of the screen
[5:09:25] Vodakhun: that sucks tho, why 2 patches back still
[5:09:30] dajja3: wy does lpl still have 8.1?
[5:09:38] Laphx: last day for 8.1 i think
[5:09:50] dajja3: Hm Lck have 8.2 today
[5:10:08] Laphx: because their weeks start on dif days, and they go through the whole week so everyone plays the same amt of series on each patch
[5:10:13] DrunkLegoPeople: patchers prob on holiday
[5:10:17] Laphx: today is lcks first day of 8.2 though
[5:10:33] dajja3: aha okey, ty!

[5:11:17] dajja3: It feels odd to see 8.1 when the game is on 8.3

[5:12:18] BabDab: Reminder Riot nerfed Zoe by adding .25 seconds to one ability
[5:12:19] thegirlismine: gg
[5:12:49] Vulpes_Luna: first pick Vlad to get destroyed by Jayce FeelsBadMan
[5:12:57] Laphx: they won't fully nerf zoe until her champion/skin sales start to fall off
[5:13:20] BabDab: Riot wont even try to balance the game until after MSI, that's just how they do things
[5:13:22] Dagobert2424: yeah gotta maximize the profit
[5:13:23] Vodakhun: her skin is shit
[5:13:32] Laphx: ofc its shit but people buy it
[5:13:49] wuuren: this game is so fast and systematic
[5:13:56] Laphx: legit if you ever question why things are the way they are, just think about it from a financial pov and you'll prob get your answer

[5:16:13] thegirlismine: game over bye chat
[5:16:14] BabDab: All Duke does is split push, it's literally all he knows how to do
[5:16:21] BabDab: theshy is a better long term prospect
[5:16:22] Laphx: ^
[5:16:29] Laphx: dukes TPs are notoriously bad
[5:16:49] BabDab: if lol was about pushing minions duke would be god
[5:17:00] wuuren: thanks for informing me. Hey whatever makes the team better
