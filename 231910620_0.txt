[4:42:11] freezy127: Es ist traurig, wie SEA bei weitem die stärkste Region ist, aber Riot macht wettbewerbsfähige Entscheidungen, um die Szene zu verletzen. Sie wollen nicht, dass SEA Welten gewinnt, weil es nicht viele SEA-Zuschauer gibt und sie die Zuschauerzahlen verringern würden. Daher unterstützen sie große Regionen, indem sie ihnen mehr Spots und passendes Meta geben
