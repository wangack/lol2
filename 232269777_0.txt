[4:03:44] ayasai: are they playing at lgd home venue?
[4:03:45] RustyTheCaster: Like why not be comet right? Augment provides slow/cc but Sion has 3 forms of it
[4:03:58] RustyTheCaster: @RiotKayne it's a pro player server with a Diamond 3 minimum rating

[4:09:35] william_media: U guys just dont know the new meta... now u shold play premade... and they place u the ward for jump with lee
[4:10:25] siegfriedOG: well yamatocannons ADC minitroupax came up with ziggs apc instead of a meta adc and legitimately rocked the laning phase and rolled over all 3 t1 turrets in 12 minutes
[4:10:33] PokeOne: why is China so behind in patch? They are still in patch 8.2. When do they go to 8.3 or are they skipping it?
[4:10:34] william_media: Braum,thamBraum,thamBraum,thamBraum,thamBraum,thamBraum,tham.
[4:10:42] siegfriedOG: sadly china and korea barely break the meta

[4:15:21] imabigdudetho: its 6am where im at
[4:15:24] william_media: Riot,change new runes in every patch,but they're supposed to have done it so there was more variety...
[4:15:40] william_media: i didnt see that ''variety'' of pick in all this new season
[4:15:48] imabigdudetho: @havetouser this stream is delayed they started game from beginning so we can watch

[4:17:27] william_media: lel thunderlord..
[4:17:41] 만두보이: wait why is it delayed a whole game?
[4:17:45] siegfriedOG: rusty did you see reddit reactions on your skt comments btw?
[4:17:52] RustyTheCaster: Because the start time for stadiums are definite
[4:17:55] ayasai: oh god BLG won
[4:18:03] ayasai: i see it
[4:18:09] RustyTheCaster: no @gazoalphonse

[4:32:35] helloshootingstar: BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack
[4:32:50] thegirlismine: come on FrankerZ
[4:33:13] siegfriedOG: AmazingJ the most underrated top laner on world
[4:33:26] siegfriedOG: he is such a consistency man
[4:34:21] imabigdudetho: he went glacial augment?
[4:34:29] imabigdudetho: the sion
[4:34:33] thegirlismine: lpl qq com
[4:35:15] siegfriedOG: yes glacial @imabigdudetho
[4:35:37] siegfriedOG: but its not worth i dont know why so many pick it. you can easily grasp of undying or aftershock, green tree way better for sion
[4:35:43] RustyTheCaster: yeah I was just doing some investigating on that choice actually
[4:35:48] RustyTheCaster: I think it enables Q max
[4:36:09] RustyTheCaster: Glacial Augments slow takes priority if the slow % is higher and until rank 4 in E the slow IS higher
[4:36:23] siegfriedOG: i'ld rather max E
[4:36:38] imabigdudetho: oooh
[4:36:43] gtmbullet: KELPTO EZREAL IS USELESS
[4:36:46] RustyTheCaster: I totally get that, but he is into a melee champion so perhaps there's a reason for it
[4:36:55] RustyTheCaster: in saying that it's cho'gath so I still think E max comet is better
[4:36:57] siegfriedOG: and start with dorans ring and 2 pots for the mana on lane
[4:37:51] RustyTheCaster: You also get inspiration as a full tree with resolve opposed to sorcery
[4:38:41] siegfriedOG: yea sounds possible
[4:39:42] siegfriedOG: i like resolve traits
[4:39:50] siegfriedOG: overgrowth is too good on sion because of perma hp increase
[4:40:01] RustyTheCaster: mm I don't think he has overgrowth though
[4:40:03] RustyTheCaster: he went second wind
[4:40:30] PokeOne: @RUSTYTheCASTER why is China so behind in patch? They are still in patch 8.2. When do they go to 8.3 or are they skipping it?
[4:40:41] Vasmin1: honor sion
[4:40:53] siegfriedOG: yea but i mean for me, i would start with dorans ring and skill aftershock or grasp of undying and dont miss the oovergrowth
[4:41:16] sorrythaturfat: LUL
[4:41:17] PokeOne: @RUSTYTheCASTER 8.4 was rolled out early to prep pros and give them some time to inspect things for balancing before msi.

[4:41:43] RustyTheCaster: but as you'd expect china and being behind in patches is an iconic duo
[4:41:52] siegfriedOG: and second precision with legend tenacity and last stand
[4:42:20] PokeOne: @RUSTYTheCASTER oh didnt know it was a thing for china to be behind in patches. But hwo about soloq? they have 8.4 running there at least right?
[4:42:37] RustyTheCaster: SoloQ is still 8.2.
[4:42:53] RustyTheCaster: everything stops during CNY
[4:43:07] GLPhoenix: nothing happens during new year festivities... except the festivities
[4:43:11] PokeOne: @RUSTYTheCASTER wow...that's...not fair at all WutFace
[4:43:27] DeshTheWraith: i'd have more festivities the day zoe nerfs came through LUL
[4:43:34] siegfriedOG: big BUT, the new masteries slash runes give lots of viable possibilities to skill, depending on the players play style and comfort
[4:43:54] siegfriedOG: ive seen sion tops with cleptomancy rolling all over the games in higher dia
[4:44:14] PokeOne: i have been using boneplate at mid every now and then since some champs are so reliant on 3 spells combos lol
[4:44:24] thegirlismine: nice comb
[4:44:36] RustyTheCaster: Yeah，I'm sitting here waiting for just 8.3 so kog can die
[4:45:20] Linko98: 8.4 they rebuffed him lol
