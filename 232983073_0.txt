[0:54:29] Fafnir32: @dalek_zoey I know a ton of people who don't play their region. Doesn't mean it's dying, necessarily.
[0:54:32] eslrahc: cause Chinese cannot watch in twitch
[0:54:32] HonestFeet: and also lck being better
[0:54:48] Dalek_Zoey: i watched lms on garena's site directly, people are still watching and having fun there

[0:55:54] bloatyy: China has 2 teams in Semis can't really say they're not the second best region rn
[0:55:58] thegirlismine: because eu don't has its own website KappaPride

[1:33:37] kaneb1: @Eyepoor_ on eu their pretty entertaining on NA its just choking lol
[1:33:41] narvuntien: TSM just aren't performing well enough and have always been slow to adjust to new metas... there is a realistic chance they miss playoffs
[1:33:57] edgelordweeb: Part of what made GGS vs CLG fun was CLG losing to GGS though

[1:38:02] notaylee: tsm is going to make the playoffs
[1:38:03] LmaoLp: tsm is 6-6, fly/opt at 4-8 are next closest
[1:38:08] HonestFeet: remember when longzhu won worlds last year?
[1:38:12] notaylee: with 6 games left, they only need about 3 more wins to clinch playoffs
[1:38:15] HonestFeet: oh yea xD
[1:38:17] notaylee: the bottom teams are too far behind
[1:38:31] edgelordweeb: @lubendont why
[1:38:34] narvuntien: I think that is the most likely play offs unless 8.4 really shakes it up. Optic and Fly are biting on TSMs heels though and both teams have strong mid laners
[1:38:47] trapaholics: if china can't have blood how do they explain Vlad? He's a squid wizard who shoots ink?
[1:38:48] Dagobert2424: adcs still only on Dorans LUL
[1:38:53] mujarshad: mannnnnn i wish ef didn't int to tsm BibleThump
[1:38:55] notaylee: clg and guardians have no chance
[1:38:57] Gamrison: Oh snap finally recalls bot lane
[1:39:05] notaylee: optic and fly are 2 games behind
[1:39:07] edgelordweeb: @drhonker why
[1:39:15] notaylee: so they have to go 2 games more than tsm in 3 weeks
[1:39:19] LmaoLp: fly, 100t, tl, c9, ggs and clg for tsm's remaining games of the split btw
[1:39:20] notaylee: possible, but unliekly'
[1:39:37] GummiGrim: @otshirvani I think it's just the explicit showing that's censored, so they're probably aware he's still a hemomage
[1:39:56] MagikLimbo: even with cb he still loses tower
[1:39:57] decco41: tsm fans everywhere DansGame
[1:40:02] notaylee: good all @cursedexistance they should win 3 of those 4
[1:40:07] narvuntien: TSM is only favourite in 3 of those games.. they lose to fly and its on
[1:40:09] Dalek_Zoey: which na/eu team would be in RR？
[1:40:11] Arkaydy: did tsm wonnered?
[1:40:12] notaylee: *3 of 6
[1:40:23] edgelordweeb: TSM fans BrokeBack C9 fans BrokeBack
[1:40:25] HonestFeet: granted tsm only needs about 3 wins for playoffs, they only have a real chance to win in 3 of their remaining games
[1:40:25] notaylee: but tsm only needs about 3 wins for playoffs
[1:40:29] Arkaydy: Kappa
[1:40:39] LmaoLp: @lubendont i dunno man, they've looked pretty bad all round. anything could happen.
[1:40:48] Maver_92: @Dalek_Zoey for eu it will likely be G2 or Fnatic
[1:40:48] HonestFeet: so unless they win whenever they are expected to (hasnt been the case so far), or pull of some major upsets, theyre not making it to playoffs
[1:40:52] 6deadlyraven9: !pach
[1:40:59] Dalek_Zoey: ty
[1:41:02] GummiGrim: LPL is still on 8.2

[1:41:06] lilaobayihun88: Doinb mixed player
[1:41:07] bloatyy: If Misfits fix their late game they can win EU tbh, they always win early
[1:41:10] LmaoLp: that said, i don't see fly/opt making enough of a push this late in the split to overtake tsm and deny playoffs.
[1:41:10] Scorp98: Why is everyone talking about NA in LPL chat..
[1:41:15] 6deadlyraven9: ty :)
[1:41:17] scottoflorida2014: As a new League fan I was looking for a fresh, crisp positive vibe team that knows how to win. I found it in TSM, yes TSM know how to win Kappa

[1:44:34] scottoflorida2014: @cursedexistance some call it banter, others call it fiesta but its not their fault. They don't get to play against better teams so it hurts them

[2:08:39] Gamrison: True, they are light nerfs I agree
[2:08:42] FloristtheBudew: rusty <3
[2:08:53] AustinXhensL: the only way youre gonna make tristana not the best crit adc by default is to nerf her range or remove her w reset
[2:09:13] Rebound_Dig: i dont understand whz tristana needs buff to compensate for nerfs, the champ hjas been favored bz riot for seasons now
[2:09:17] AustinXhensL: shes just too safe of a champion
[2:09:19] DocReverb: the w reset is the issue
[2:09:22] MagikLimbo: @ggGetJinxed guess patch 8.6 will be Kai,Sa so that'll be new
[2:09:26] DocReverb: id say anyways

[2:09:41] DocReverb: yup that too
[2:09:41] Gamrison: @crinklycheesechips That will be a spicy release yeah
[2:09:45] AustinXhensL: not really having 725 range with mobilty and an aoe knockback is the issue
[2:09:46] DocReverb: the buffering is especially lame
[2:09:54] AustinXhensL: you either have to nerf her range or her safety
[2:09:58] tj950618: Clearlove will attend the next game
[2:10:02] GummiGrim: Pretty sure everyone has mixed opinions on what to actually nerf, the good parts of champions are always annoying
[2:10:13] AustinXhensL: i like the w buffering it gives her a skillcap other than rightclicking

[2:10:30] AustinXhensL: its not easy to do either though
[2:10:34] Gamrison: According to August, Riot Jinxylord, they don't want to hit Tristana too hard, and instead give her more weaknesses for people to play with against her, though he thinks the nerfs might be too light currently.
[2:10:36] yunbooooo: I think varus and xayah are op

[2:13:31] Dont_Wutface_Me: i guess if u hav a good support
[2:13:31] GummiGrim: Found the NALCS rule book, they said the champ must be on live for at least a week before it can see pro play, reworks are except from the week
