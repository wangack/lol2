[1:54:24] Solo_Dolo_: Imp washed or meta needs to change LUL
[1:54:25] eat_a__snickers: imp was like 1v9ing earlier this seas how is he bad
[1:54:27] Art1ficer_: jackeylove
[1:54:31] camelwink: @Clunk_Smash Jackeylove?
[1:54:32] shiny_chocobo: Teddy overrated LUL
[1:54:32] grayofblood: Imp is like very korean that has reached worldd
[1:54:42] grayofblood: they go to china for $$$$
[1:54:43] nameless_typhlosion: I'm not sure teddy is the best but he's definitely one of the better ones this year
[1:54:43] oyecomova11: where is this 3m chinese stream?
[1:54:51] Reijus_Doormat: teddy had like 3 good games and everyone thinks he's a god now LUL
[1:54:57] mujarshad: probly douyu
[1:54:59] Art1ficer_: Teddy is probably the best performing adc in the world as of right now* so as of this exact snapshot
[1:55:01] grayofblood: or NA/EU in rare occasions
[1:55:03] fox__mulder: is godv playing Kappa ?
[1:55:04] mainanalyst: when UZI is on, hes best in world, but sometimes he is inconsistent
[1:55:10] nameless_typhlosion: well it's more the fact that teddy has to carry jin air lol
[1:55:10] Art1ficer_: he's not the best overall adc, def not
[1:55:18] Art1ficer_: just his peak atm is insane.
[1:55:18] mujarshad: based on what?
[1:55:20] MdwdMw: SourPls
[1:55:22] mainanalyst: GOLDV retired
[1:55:26] eat_a__snickers: Defts never been better than imp at any point in his career LOL
[1:55:31] mujarshad: uzi is the best
[1:55:41] fox__mulder: godv with aluka is a pro un pubg now
[1:55:41] skomie: Bang LUL
[1:55:41] grayofblood: bang in 2018 Kappa
[1:55:45] Reijus_Doormat: BANG is washed up LUL
[1:55:46] Art1ficer_: Bang and Deft are kinda trash tho atm....well Bang anyway, Deft is pretty good
[1:55:51] nameless_typhlosion: I think bang looks good simply because skt enables him way more
[1:56:03] Itakura_StuGIII: >imp >good LUL
[1:56:03] mainanalyst: Deft makes some wacky decisions but his mechanics are good
[1:56:26] Art1ficer_: Deft is better now, Imp was better for several years tho
[1:56:40] eat_a__snickers: u put deft on lgd nothing changes
[1:56:42] Art1ficer_: Imp is probably overall the better player
[1:56:42] michaelsund: Why talk about Imp FailFish hes so irrelevant
[1:56:43] mainanalyst: KT just need to remove Smeb from shotcalling, then they win
[1:56:47] nameless_typhlosion: if they had even teams then yeah, I'd probably take imp over deft but it's hard to gauge how good they are vs each other
[1:56:53] nameless_typhlosion: the teams are just miles apart
[1:56:59] Art1ficer_: @HERO_IS_HERE never believe Koreans in interviews
[1:57:01] grayofblood: kt first place
[1:57:07] michaelsund: Imp pretty much retired EleGiggle
[1:57:11] 琴強尼: 幹你的克萊門?
[1:57:24] nameless_typhlosion: by retired you me sold out Kappa
[1:57:30] mainanalyst: yep Khan #1
[1:57:31] nameless_typhlosion: mean*
[1:57:37] carlsz: Huni
[1:57:44] Art1ficer_: Khan is the best performing atm sure, but his team makes him look better. whereas Smeb's team makes him look worse
[1:57:45] michaelsund: Huni MingLee
[1:57:49] Art1ficer_: overall Smeb is still king
[1:57:52] mainanalyst: his teammate is not bad also, Rascal
[1:57:55] Reijus_Doormat: didn't khan get solo killed by sion in lane LUL
[1:58:02] nameless_typhlosion: yeah I think khan is pretty overrated
[1:58:08] nameless_typhlosion: he's good but he's not some god
[1:58:11] mainanalyst: Smeb is shocking this season, his decision making is awful
[1:58:13] Art1ficer_: Khan is still the best as of right now, but snapshots like this don't mean everything
[1:58:16] eat_a__snickers: Imp will never go back to lck FeelsBadMan like Kakao FeelsBadMan
[1:58:20] camelwink: did Bing play Azir against EDG?
[1:58:30] michaelsund: @eat_a__snickers because hes trash
[1:58:30] Art1ficer_: like how Teddy is the best performing right now, but yaknow he's hardly up in anyones top adc lists of all time
[1:58:32] nameless_typhlosion: oh god kakao FeelsBadMan
[1:58:36] Solo_Dolo_: Imp is washed u noobs
[1:58:38] winwin311: 2-0 sweep plz BlessRNG
[1:58:43] Solo_Dolo_: He’s retiring
[1:58:47] mujarshad: ig vs edg waiting room ResidentSleeper
[1:59:06] mainanalyst: I understand why SKT dropped Huni now, he doesn't adjust his playstyle
[1:59:10] Art1ficer_: Huni is still a good player lol
[1:59:14] grayofblood: ignoring rhe fact afreeca is a good team rn
[1:59:16] mainanalyst: yes
[1:59:16] Reijus_Doormat: the only player more washed up than imp is clear LUL
[1:59:17] Art1ficer_: SKT are missing Huni lol
[1:59:19] Solo_Dolo_: Did you see imp ganks on zac??
[1:59:23] Art1ficer_: not a lot but, yaknow...
[1:59:31] Gunerdrag: bjerg would easily be top 2 mids in LCK
[1:59:33] Art1ficer_: their current two tops are trash
[1:59:43] Reijus_Doormat: @Gunerdrag cmonBruh
[1:59:45] nameless_typhlosion: with how SKT is trending, I think KT may be in trouble again LUL
[1:59:46] Art1ficer_: @xPekeIsG0d well Kingzone are favourites anyway
[1:59:49] mujarshad: no, he's 17
[1:59:56] Art1ficer_: but with Ucal KT could win imo
[1:59:57] Gunerdrag: @Grand_Sizulo Kappa
[1:59:59] mainanalyst: Kt will not make worlds
[2:00:02] mujarshad: you can't play at the higher leagues until you are 17
[2:00:03] Art1ficer_: I'll have to see how he does before saying that though
[2:00:07] mainanalyst: KT have the same issues as last year
[2:00:14] Art1ficer_: Pawn is really holding KT back
[2:00:16] michaelsund: @clunk_smash idk why would they get an EU cs player LUL
[2:00:29] Art1ficer_: super overrated player past 2014 (even in 2014 Dade was miles and miles better)
[2:00:33] Gunerdrag: i think SKT could be top 3 team if they had a good jungler like reignover or dardoch
[2:00:37] grayofblood: imagine thinking kt is garbage without trolling
[2:00:41] mainanalyst: Pawn is fine, but their commication and shotcalling is off
[2:00:48] mujarshad: how is pawn overrated?
[2:00:51] Art1ficer_: and Faker was still the best, just Dade hit his level at points. Only player to ever do so really (well arugable)
[2:01:08] Reijus_Doormat: Rush has played less games this season than Blank FeelsBadMan 🔫
[2:01:14] grayofblood: you can say kingzone is better than kt
[2:01:20] grayofblood: they are
[2:01:26] mainanalyst: if KZ work on their teamfights, they will steamroll worlds
[2:01:27] michaelsund: Its not choking if you do it all the time
[2:01:29] Art1ficer_: Pawn has just been rubbish on KT
[2:01:42] Art1ficer_: never has any lane pressure so Score (greatest jungler of all time) can't do anything...
[2:01:52] grayofblood: but saying kt is garbage is dumb
[2:01:53] Art1ficer_: and often just has non-existant performances
[2:01:53] Beetrayn: Fighting platyPOG
[2:02:05] mainanalyst: but they give pawn dumb champions like Galio
[2:02:21] Reijus_Doormat: @Clunk_Smash 2 HP LUL
[2:02:28] mainanalyst: Pawn plays his role ok
[2:02:30] Art1ficer_: don't remind me...
[2:02:32] camelwink: Herbivore :o
[2:02:34] Beetrayn: no offense
[2:02:49] Art1ficer_: yeah I'm saying Pawn is trash
[2:02:49] mainanalyst: sure thats current form
[2:02:58] Art1ficer_: Faker then BDD then Kuro for sure
[2:03:01] purpleonedevil: Wat

[2:03:25] mujarshad: Pawn is a bad player BrokeBack twitch chat btw BrokeBack
[2:03:28] Art1ficer_: LPL has some really good mids now tho, LCK has 3 good ones that's it tbh
[2:03:35] michaelsund: Lck mid talent so weak EleGiggle
[2:03:36] Art1ficer_: maybe Ucal can prove good tho

[2:04:38] Beetrayn: Zoe monkaS
[2:04:42] grayofblood: afreeca is a contender for lck champions so saying kt is garbage for losing to afreeca is dumb reminder ResidentSleeper
[2:04:45] mainanalyst: remember 8.3 is the 0.25 patch, so 8.2 Zoe is god still
[2:04:47] ParisOgre: 8.2 LUL 8.2 LUL
[2:04:59] belongto5procent: 8.2 DansGame

[2:05:22] Machrus: Imp PogChamp

[2:06:10] belongto5procent: @clunk_smash no one expected LZ to win summer split 2017 either
[2:06:13] Art1ficer_: I just wanna see IG give the top Korean team a run for their money in MSI final
[2:06:25] ElvirD2008: anyone know result between Ultimate VS. FTV Esport???
[2:06:41] eat_a__snickers: ?

[2:21:39] Miitniick: UZI TITLE LUL
[2:21:50] FlinchFlinch: SKT was better in summer than in worlds because they were playing with untara, huni fed hard at worlds and forced the team to play around him to stop the bleeding
[2:21:51] PastMasters: Uzi winning a title this split BlessRNG
[2:21:51] Art1ficer_: it just shows that even with Korea falling apart, LCK > LPL. ALSO it shows how important teamwork is in LoL

[2:40:35] Art1ficer_: Score is the best jungler in the world, I don't even know why they got Rush on the team unless it's as a practise partner for Score, or some weird one of cheese strat they have prepared for playoffs

[2:41:01] bloatyy: @flinchflinch this is not the usual game besides both of these teams aren't even in playoffs
[2:41:02] NomadicHand: @armaann I don't follow EU, but I try and from what I've seen in highlights of games, all the means look like they're 7-7 somehow :D

[2:42:55] bloatyy: H2K cannot get play offs
[2:42:59] TomatoEMT: Guys what is IMP old team?
[2:43:04] FlinchFlinch: EDG vs iG only has 4 good players (4 koreans) vs 10 Koreans in LCK Kappa
[2:43:05] Dagobert2424: @chazzy29 Jinoo is Korean
[2:43:07] bloatyy: SSW
[2:43:10] Art1ficer_: omg don't watch bottom tier LPL teams then
[2:43:17] GummiGrim: @xPekeIsG0d Some people enjoy more fast pace games, especially with how slow the meta has been
[2:43:27] Art1ficer_: it's like claiming NA is trash based off of that Dig vs Ren game
[2:43:27] TomatoEMT: Samsung Galaxy White? = SSW?
[2:43:28] NomadicHand: @armaann What is with the UOL hype? Again I just watch highlights, but the casters always seem hyped for them
[2:43:46] blackfeather241: Everytime I see LPL see a clown fiesta LUL I like it PogChamp
[2:43:47] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod That's the team, they won Season 4 Worlds in a pretty dominant fashion
[2:43:48] bloatyy: yes ssw is Samsung white
[2:43:59] Art1ficer_: Imp is washed up af
[2:44:05] Art1ficer_: we already had this conversation
[2:44:09] TomatoEMT: oh i see i am new to league of legends thanks :)
[2:44:09] eat_a__snickers: OMG FeelsBadMan
[2:44:14] malik_610: @nomadichand basically they started off the season shit and now they’re coming back and destroying or something
[2:44:14] andrzejdrewniak: next time this guy who have hair like my little pony
[2:44:18] Dagobert2424: @chazzy29 I dont think so but idk
[2:44:26] bloatyy: imp himself said he's not good enough anymore, also has wrist problems
[2:44:26] Art1ficer_: daily reminder that SSB were overall better in 2014 than SSW
[2:44:28] FlinchFlinch: even top tier LPL games are fiesta, iG is basically just running around and hoping theShy and Rookie hard carry and it works
[2:44:34] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod Feel free to ask anything, I'm sure me or someone else will answer
[2:44:37] Art1ficer_: and that Dade is the 2nd best mid ever
[2:44:39] mujarshad: how do i learn to play sivir?
[2:44:51] mujarshad: i really like sivir but i suck on it BibleThump
[2:44:54] PreacherCasts: Damn, Dom.
[2:44:56] scottoflorida2014: Is that Rusty of Frosk :)
[2:44:57] mujarshad: Dom 4Head

[2:45:10] blackfeather241: LPL Fanboys LUL
[2:45:12] mujarshad: NotLikeThi
[2:45:14] TomatoEMT: thanks League community is nice :)
[2:45:18] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly Yeah I saw that they're on a 4-0 win streak right now? but they still seem rather hyped for them when most of their original teammates left
[2:45:21] mujarshad: NotLikeThis
[2:45:24] armaann: @NomadicHand i havent seen all their games, but they started 1-8 and have gone on a 4 game winstreak so that's probably why they're casters are hyped for them
[2:45:24] Art1ficer_: SSW were always better in the early game, but no team could take them to late game in 2014 worlds @eat_a__snickers
[2:45:25] diogosapessoa: Wheres Froskurin? BibleThump
[2:45:25] GummiGrim: @mujarshad Just keep practicing, as long as you enjoy the champ, it shouldn't be bad
[2:45:27] shenbot111: @makicsgod Kappa
[2:45:29] Art1ficer_: and SSB were always better late game
[2:45:37] ATrueMysteryy: do i have time for an aram before IG vs. EDG?
[2:45:45] Warwizard23: When did NA win worlds again? oops! forgot they havent LUL
[2:45:47] eat_a__snickers: if u cant win early you just suck LUL
[2:45:47] Art1ficer_: but yeah SSW's peak was higher than SSB's, but SSB were better the course of the year on average
[2:46:02] Dagobert2424: @chazzy29 yeah Martin + Caveman are Chineese
[2:46:05] malik_610: @nomadichand EU hypes up anything they can just to pretend they have someone to compete for worlds when they know it isn’t true LUL
[2:46:28] FlinchFlinch: EU mids Caps, Perkz LUL KR mids BDD, Faker PogChamp
[2:46:35] Art1ficer_: Mata and Dandy were absolute gods of vision, completely changed how it works. invented taking over one half (like west vs east, not just ur side of the map)
[2:46:36] TomatoEMT: Who is the better team in 2018? iG or EDG?
[2:46:39] mujarshad: yeah, let me miss ig vs edg for rox vs bbq 4Head
[2:46:40] Art1ficer_: of the map*
[2:46:41] blackfeather241: EU and NA LUL Both can't make it to world's final LUL
[2:46:42] djjohnnymelster: IG

[2:46:53] mujarshad: ig
[2:46:53] Warwizard23: IG
[2:46:55] spicyvt: keep the camera stil LOL
[2:46:57] TomatoEMT: why iG? are they really strong
[2:46:59] Art1ficer_: so I do love SSW don't get me wrong. I watched a lot of solo q Mata and Dandy vods to get good at the game
[2:47:04] FlinchFlinch: LPL fans dont wanna hear it but ROX could beat iG in bo5
[2:47:09] eat_a__snickers: Ssb wins was just dade 1v5ing the early games till deft had like 3 items on twitch n kog
[2:47:09] FlinchFlinch: ROX is good now
[2:47:24] TomatoEMT: who is ROX?
[2:47:26] GummiGrim: I was cheering for Royal Club during Season 4 FeelsBadMan
[2:47:30] djjohnnymelster: martin is so bad lol
[2:47:30] mujarshad: sure they could
[2:47:31] Art1ficer_: basically just copied them lol
[2:47:35] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod ROX is an LCK team
[2:47:47] TomatoEMT: what is LCK?
[2:47:50] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod You can watch LCK on LCK1, LCK is the Korean league
[2:47:51] Itakura_StuGIII: people underestimating Rookie LUL
[2:47:51] NomadicHand: @armaann Who do you like in EU?
[2:47:51] Warwizard23: ROX been strong lately
[2:47:59] TomatoEMT: oh Korean
[2:48:06] Dagobert2424: @chazzy29 probably wont happen but yeah Jinoo deserves better than Vici
[2:48:06] camelwink: I hope LPL doesn't win anything so we won't have bandwagons like LCK xD
[2:48:08] TomatoEMT: are Korean better than chinese ?
[2:48:08] carlsz: Talking about NA and EU BrokeBack
[2:48:23] Art1ficer_: yes Koreans are better than Chinese at LoL
[2:48:24] RazkalzMonster: where is insec BibleThump
[2:48:27] mujarshad: rookie would make lava his slot machine in the mid lane
[2:48:29] Art1ficer_: how'd you even stumble in here anyway @MakiCSgod
[2:48:31] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod Generally speaking yes, Korea is considered the best region and have won most of the World Championships
[2:48:34] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly Hey, you got more of a chance at worlds than us at NA that's for sure :P
[2:48:38] FlinchFlinch: insec is waiting for the 5 man korean team in LPL
[2:48:39] eat_a__snickers: makics Jebaited chat

[2:49:08] StarSashimi: KARSA IN BACKGROUND PogChamp
[2:49:10] Art1ficer_: god I hope rift rivals has a different format this year, the b01 stuff just wasn't the fairest
[2:49:12] shenbot111: What region do you support @xpekeisg0d
[2:49:14] malik_610: @nomadichand I’m NA too LUL but Echo Fox is better than any EU team tbh
[2:49:30] eat_a__snickers: Tbq PogChamp
[2:49:31] GummiGrim: @shennbot :THINKING:
[2:49:34] Art1ficer_: imagine a crew battle like in Melee, for rift rivals. each team has 2 or 3 lives, you lose one on each loss, lose them all you're out
[2:49:43] velocegravity: Jinoo not even on LetMes level
[2:49:43] Art1ficer_: you try place all your 4 or 5 teams strategically
[2:49:49] shenbot111: @xpekeisg0d isn’t your name a EU player
[2:49:51] TomatoEMT: i bet on iG GL HF iG
[2:49:55] Art1ficer_: KZ could just kill everyone if they were good enough
[2:49:57] shenbot111: Speke
[2:50:03] shenbot111: Xpeke
[2:50:06] camelwink: @xPekeIsG0d it doesn't matter if I support a "region that hasn't won anything significant' I don't ruin other regions' chats
[2:50:13] djjohnnymelster: isn't grex raise + old midnight sun?
[2:50:13] malik_610: Levi on 100A PogChamp
[2:50:14] Warwizard23: They really should change up the * of teams a region sends
[2:50:14] mujarshad: JL vs iboy PogChamp
[2:50:17] eat_a__snickers: KZ overrated Kappa
[2:50:31] GummiGrim: KZ did lose 0-3 to SSG Kappa
[2:50:32] MdwdMw: 10 mins RezidentSleeper
[2:50:34] shenbot111: So you’ve switched side form eu to NA to lms and now lck?
[2:50:41] shenbot111: Yikes
[2:50:48] Art1ficer_: LUL
[2:50:57] Dagobert2424: thats called a non loyal fan LUL
[2:51:07] FlinchFlinch: switched sides, my dude these are all teams full of Asian players that you don't speak the same language as
[2:51:08] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly I want to say Huni is carrying, but he's looking better than he did on Immortals so I want to say Dardoch has stepped up
[2:51:14] GummiGrim: @Dagobert2424 isn't that a bandwagon?
[2:51:18] armaann: @NomadicHand I don't really have a favorite team but I like Roccat cause I think Profit/Blanc got too much shit before the season and also Splyce cause Kasing is funny af
[2:51:26] shenbot111: So you’re one of those people that support the best region and shit on other fans for it? @xpekeisg0d
[2:51:28] Penneb: CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat
[2:51:29] Warwizard23: @dagobert2424 4Head
[2:51:49] Dagobert2424: @GummiGrim kinda with Korea but since he supports NA idk LUL
[2:52:01] yaaz000: IG clean 2-0
[2:52:19] shenbot111: @xpekeisg0d I think they can lol ig is pretty good rn
[2:52:26] GummiGrim: @xPekeIsG0d You're telling me you haven't been watching LPL, but are judging them not to win 🤔
[2:52:33] malik_610: @nomadichand huni is doing very well but their team synergy is what’s really carrying them. They work as a cohesive unit and no NA team can match it
[2:52:34] shenbot111: ^
[2:52:49] FlinchFlinch: Papasmithy is casting right now dude
[2:52:59] malik_610: @nomadichand their loss against TSM was a fluke because they were trolling in draft
[2:53:04] GummiGrim: @FlinchFlinch He was actually in chat a while ago, I missed what he said though
[2:53:06] Dagobert2424: thinking ROX or Afreeca are better than IG without seeing them play eachother LUL
[2:53:15] shenbot111: You’re a nobody to papasmithy he knows LPL and ally regions way better than you lmao
[2:53:18] GummiGrim: Papasmithy normally interacts with chat in-between breaks
[2:53:24] FlinchFlinch: remember iG at worlds LPL
[2:53:40] Andeiih: het
[2:53:48] malik_610: No need to seem them play each other. LCK teams are stronger and make way less mistakes than LPL teams
[2:53:53] armaann: LPL might not win worlds but at least they smash the most fangirls 😤 😤 😤
[2:53:57] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly That's what is funny to see, like someone mediocre on one team, but with the right team synergy that same player can carry
[2:54:09] FlinchFlinch: thats the real reason why imp stayed in china
[2:54:12] shenbot111: @xpekeisg0d you’ve been assuming shit about teams all this time lmao
[2:54:13] velocegravity: @xpekeisg0d who cares ?
[2:54:20] mujarshad: 4Head
[2:54:30] GummiGrim: @NomadicHand I mean a perfect example of that is ROX, or maybe even Echo Fox right now where a team is better than the sum of its parts
[2:54:41] Dagobert2424: thinking bottom tier Korean teams are any good LUL
[2:54:41] Donquixote__Doflamingo: so toxic
[2:54:43] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly EchoFox finally found that considering how bad they were before. I still think EU has better reaction timing in individual plays though
[2:54:49] shenbot111: The worst kind of fan are the ones that constantly try to call other fans for being trash constantly
[2:54:58] malik_610: LPL might have more entertaining games but LCK too strong for any LPL team
[2:54:58] FlinchFlinch: thinking korea has bottom tier teams besides MVP and Kongdoo RN LUL
[2:55:01] shenbot111: Give it a break
[2:55:24] GummiGrim: @shennbot I mean arguments generally descend into circular reasoning
[2:55:25] shenbot111: I’m not even a LPL viewer and you’re just so toxic about it for no reason
[2:55:41] MisakiKureha: idc about any other region
[2:55:45] NomadicHand: @GummiGrim Oh yeah, even all the casters ranked them either 4th of 5th and now they're dominating NA
[2:55:47] MisakiKureha: I watch this cause I like it
[2:55:58] malik_610: @nomadichand they didn’t really have a good roster before, they just hoped that they’d get lucky and froggen would carry LUL
[2:56:01] porkolokoo: oO
[2:56:06] porkolokoo: 2x
[2:56:10] armaann: they should have made the commentate a game they lost 4Head
[2:56:14] MdwdMw: Just because there is Rusty KappaPride

[2:56:20] shenbot111: Quiet chat FeelsGoodMan
[2:56:27] FlinchFlinch: the best part was all the fans praising Froggens laning stats while he did nothing worthwhile LUL
[2:56:35] shenbot111: Nvm lol

[2:57:19] camelwink: ^
[2:57:24] Art1ficer_: call out LPL fans if they're being delusional, don't make fun of them over supporting LPL
[2:57:30] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly I hope if Froggen continues, he finds that team synergy because he's really fucking good
[2:57:35] velocegravity: mid tier lck LPL team RNG would beat the shit outta every mid tier lck team
[2:57:36] Art1ficer_: of them FOR supporting LPL*
[2:57:36] NomadicHand: JoJo PogChamp

[2:57:52] Art1ficer_: actually it made sense either way, ignore me
[2:57:52] PreacherCasts: TBC meme used on the LPL. Now I've seen everything
[2:57:56] shenbot111: You’re like a Logan paul jake Paul viewer having some online banter over nothing
[2:58:03] Not_Avz: LUL
[2:58:05] shenbot111: Stopppp

[2:58:32] Art1ficer_: for some mid tier LCK game

[3:00:30] shenbot111: FeelsGoodMan :point_right: :door:
[3:00:34] Art1ficer_: tfw not gay so you can't join in conversations over how attractive pros are
[3:00:36] FlinchFlinch: @shennbot the kid who thinks scout is on the level of lava, rookie and tempt is still here LUL
[3:00:43] Dagobert2424: LPL arenas PogChamp
[3:00:49] shenbot111: I don’t even like them

[3:01:25] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly That's cool, I'm interested to see how he'll do with a new team. I didn't like seeing down in the ranks with Echo
[3:01:26] shenbot111: Mouse got a nice smile
[3:01:30] armaann: what's TGA?
[3:01:37] Art1ficer_: @bbbbbbbb yeah but I don't know how's attractive

[3:01:41] Art1ficer_: who's*
[3:01:45] Jiml0rd: dude icon is attractive
[3:01:50] bloatyy: iboy growing
[3:01:51] bbbbbbbb: ^^^
[3:01:52] shenbot111: Icon is pretty cute
[3:01:52] Jiml0rd: from OMG
[3:02:00] bbbbbbbb: icon a qt
[3:02:06] shenbot111: Zzitai is my favorite though
[3:02:08] Dagobert2424: LPL have so many new super good Rookies
[3:02:11] shenbot111: He’s really cute... to me
[3:02:11] camelwink: i like xiyang better than icon personal pref tho
[3:02:20] goblinguy01: That's like saying X actor is good looking. That has nothing to do with being homosexual or not
[3:02:22] Jiml0rd: if I would go gay for any guy it would be Icon or flame
[3:02:22] ninjaturtle12: HAWT
[3:02:25] djjohnnymelster: I heard there are rumors about xiyang
[3:02:27] NomadicHand: @KhadaJhinOnly I don't think he should be the shotclatter though. He seems too passive in his playstyle
[3:02:38] Art1ficer_: yeah but I'm a terrible judge of how guys look
[3:02:42] FridayNightFightNight: packed, there's what, 100 seats?
[3:02:45] FlinchFlinch: i dont think non gay people use cute to describe other guys tho
[3:02:47] Art1ficer_: look w/e carry on your conversation
[3:02:54] GummiGrim: @Clunk_Smash Beauty is in the eye of the beholder Kappa
[3:02:57] Jiml0rd: i mean i like tattoos and piercings on girls
[3:03:06] Jiml0rd: so i feel guys would be the same thing
[3:03:09] NomadicHand: @FlinchFlinch I do and I'm like only 5% gay
[3:03:11] malik_610: Time for LCK it was nice talking to you all BibleThump
[3:03:20] Makio_x3: RAY ♥
[3:03:24] FlinchFlinch: not having two monitors LUL
[3:03:25] shenbot111: Go away lmao
[3:03:25] Art1ficer_: I'd call Peanut cute
[3:03:28] goblinguy01: I mean if people look good in tattoos and Piercing, that's it.
[3:03:28] Machrus: @KhadaJhinOnly youre making a mistake not watchin this one
[3:03:32] shenbot111: Go watch lck
[3:03:32] GummiGrim: @KhadaJhinOnly Nice having you here, I guess Kappa
[3:03:32] Art1ficer_: 0% gay btw not at all insecure
[3:03:35] camelwink: @Dagobert2424 the dive bit on the lpl is so good to describe why they have so many rookies
[3:03:48] GangMember_Tourelle: Watching ROX vs BBQ over iG vs EDG LUL
[3:04:18] FridayNightFightNight: glad our casters can talk about League of Legends like it's a football game and make it boring as hell
[3:04:23] NomadicHand: The discussions, good or bad, are way better here than LCK :'(
[3:04:27] goblinguy01: Did Ray speak Mandarin in the video?
[3:04:31] shenbot111: Chat do you agree: western viewer will call LPL games a fiesta no matter how it goes because of the Chinese aggression narrative
[3:04:36] camelwink: @goblibguy01 nope he spoke korean
[3:04:49] goblinguy01: RiP. He needs to learn it!
[3:04:58] Jiml0rd: yea
[3:05:02] Art1ficer_: the whole 'Korean style' and 'Chinese style' narratives are BS
[3:05:11] shenbot111: ^ facts
[3:05:11] Jiml0rd: i don't think any international games like worlds are really fiestas
[3:05:14] bloatyy: China 2 semis in 1 worlds, PogChamp, NA 0 semis in 6 years LUL
[3:05:21] shenbot111: Top teams in LPL plays way better macro now
[3:05:28] Art1ficer_: the top Korean teams play at the highest level...so they are macro foccused. that's how you're supposed to play
[3:05:30] bbbbbbbb: 34% dmg share holy
[3:05:35] camelwink: @goblibguy01 i think he knows a lot already but isnt confident in it yet, culture shock ep1 shows his english hehe
[3:05:38] G_ginin_der: 17
[3:05:43] Jiml0rd: shit 2001
[3:05:47] Machrus: THEYRE SO SMALL
[3:05:50] MdwdMw: 21 Century PogChamp
[3:06:00] Dagobert2424: 2001 feelsoldman
[3:06:00] Art1ficer_: a select few top LPL teams were team fight oriented, hence creating the 'Chinese style' narrative to western fans that don't watch LPL. the top LPL teams are macro foccused now because they are good at the game
[3:06:06] Art1ficer_: not cos they copied Korea or w/e
[3:06:14] camelwink: THATS A LIE IBOY IS 2000
[3:06:14] shenbot111: Yep
[3:06:31] shenbot111: Too bad anything that happens is just dumb Chinese aggression btw haHAA
[3:06:35] Jiml0rd: i see fiestas in lck
[3:06:40] Jiml0rd: mvp vs kdm
[3:06:40] Dullitwin: are you even allowed to compete at worlds with 17? 🤔
[3:06:41] Art1ficer_: yep
[3:06:47] Art1ficer_: I see fiestas in every region lol
[3:06:51] camelwink: @Dullitwin iboy did
[3:06:59] Jiml0rd: but tbh all of na are fiestas
[3:07:02] FridayNightFightNight: camille sucks tho p;
[3:07:05] Jiml0rd: best na team is c9
[3:07:06] Art1ficer_: just bottom tier teams are always gonna be bad
[3:07:06] goblinguy01: Yes. Lol back into old LPL. S2 World Elite and IG week major focus. S4 EDG were macro focus
[3:07:13] Art1ficer_: and all NA teams are gonna be bad :^)
[3:07:14] Machrus: china is a fiesta with no macro-- my region plays best of 1s btw haHAA
[3:07:19] goblinguy01: Only OMG were "deathball" style
[3:07:19] Jiml0rd: i fucking love old lpl
[3:07:20] Dagobert2424: fiestas in LCK are boring 60min games fiestas in LPL are atleast exciting to watch
[3:07:21] WhitePantsBrownStain: NA LuL
[3:07:30] Jiml0rd: yorick s3 jungle prio in summer
[3:07:36] goblinguy01: S2 World Elite was Korean Style before it was called Korean
[3:07:40] Jiml0rd: started shyv jungle competitvely
[3:07:46] goblinguy01: So World Elite is s2 lol
[3:07:46] FlinchFlinch: thats because LPL teams make braindead decisions and throw a lot more than in LCK
[3:07:51] Dullitwin: 1.1k viewers LUL people don't even realize what they are missing out on
[3:08:08] Art1ficer_: Korean style is playing the game properly
[3:08:23] goblinguy01: That's how WE won IpL5
[3:08:36] Art1ficer_: yes, the real worlds of 2012
[3:08:42] nickthierry: :)
[3:08:43] goblinguy01: They farmed, fought for wards, freeze and take 1 fight
[3:08:54] Art1ficer_: tho Moscow 5 and *** are still candidates (mostly the former) for top team of 2012
[3:08:58] Dagobert2424: idk if stalling to 60mins and give everything up without a fight even your nexus is the right way to play
[3:08:59] goblinguy01: TPA mastered split push with Nidalee and Shen
[3:09:01] Art1ficer_: still salty *** didn't win the first OGN
[3:09:03] FlinchFlinch: WE won ipl5 because weixiao was better than every other ADC
[3:09:05] shenbot111: Oh man remember Moscow 5
[3:09:12] shenbot111: FeelsBadMan
[3:09:15] Art1ficer_: and that Moscow 5 fkd up in IPL5 (in semis or something?)
[3:09:19] halloderbaer: start the game FeelsBadMan
[3:09:34] goblinguy01: No. Fzzf ever missed a Sona ult lol
[3:09:35] Jiml0rd: misaya too
[3:09:43] Art1ficer_: WeiXiao was the best player ever at the time
[3:09:52] goblinguy01: CaoMei was a tank player
[3:09:59] TomatoEMT: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:10:00] Dagobert2424: s2 WE was just overall the best team by far
[3:10:00] shenbot111: I miss weixiao bruh, he just plays pubg now
[3:10:06] goblinguy01: Never*
[3:10:11] Jiml0rd: remember namei
[3:10:31] goblinguy01: NaMei was suppose to be WX :(
[3:10:33] FlinchFlinch: namei is the anti UZI
[3:10:35] TomatoEMT: 8.2 LUL
[3:10:37] Jiml0rd: him and fzzf were scary
[3:10:47] shenbot111: These arenas are so fucking nice
[3:10:49] Art1ficer_: in LPL you basically just have a team, not much swapping. so if top players have a slump, or a top team finds some crazy good new player, you can get sent into early retirement
[3:10:59] Jiml0rd: Chinese have always produced good ADCs
[3:11:01] Art1ficer_: such as WeiXiao and Namei, two of the best ADCs of all time
[3:11:03] goblinguy01: Fzzf was the best Chinese support before Meiko started
[3:11:09] Art1ficer_: it's why Uzi changing teams was such a huge deal
[3:11:13] spicyvt: start the game its been 40 minutes
[3:11:21] spicyvt: jesus christ
[3:11:25] FlinchFlinch: OMG all chinese super team LUL
[3:11:27] shenbot111: Patience my child
[3:11:38] Art1ficer_: @goblibguy01 for sure
[3:11:42] bloatyy: IG PogChamp
[3:11:43] camelwink: Rookie is the only one not serious xD
[3:11:48] bbbbbbbb: uzi the goat adc
[3:11:57] Jiml0rd: baolan really improved
[3:12:00] goblinguy01: IG is going to MSI?
[3:12:01] nickthierry: CN MACRO LUL
[3:12:05] Jiml0rd: he has impressed me he is meiko tier
[3:12:05] Art1ficer_: was just rewatching some 2013 LPL with all these players actually...god damn they were good times
[3:12:10] bloatyy: Rookie specificallyis so fucking good
[3:12:12] camelwink: Which team beat them in team jg% xD
[3:12:12] Art1ficer_: and 2014 LPL
[3:12:19] TomatoEMT: When is the next Major for League of Legends?
[3:12:21] Jiml0rd: whoever wins this series is going to MSI for lpl tbh
[3:12:33] Art1ficer_: Uzi is barely even top 5 adc of all time m8
[3:12:37] bloatyy: @MakiCSgod MSI is in May if that's wht you're asking about
[3:12:38] maihu: Which team may have more chance win
[3:12:40] Jiml0rd: unless RNG comes back IG and EDG are top 2 teams
[3:12:44] FridayNightFightNight: league of casters, when's actually gameplay happen?
[3:12:46] TomatoEMT: yeah that one
[3:12:54] Art1ficer_: he's really good but god damn are there some good adcs that have come and gone (or not gone yet)
[3:13:00] goblinguy01: WE is looking bad. What happened?
[3:13:05] Dagobert2424: I feel like RNG will recover untill playoffs
[3:13:05] camelwink: @Bludrigg420 that depends on the actual chinese dudes not them
[3:13:14] FlinchFlinch: idk how you can think anyone but Pray is the best ADC ever at this point
[3:13:15] goblinguy01: They won't make worlds at this rate
[3:13:20] yousefbruh: homme leaved we
[3:13:24] Jiml0rd: yuppppp
[3:13:24] nickthierry: WutFace
[3:13:33] Jiml0rd: pray best adc ever
[3:13:34] camelwink: @Dagobert2424 well RNG are on an upward swing so looks good so far
[3:13:35] FridayNightFightNight: woot more casters
[3:13:39] goblinguy01: Did Homme leave to Korea?
[3:13:50] michaelsund: SMOrc
[3:13:50] shenbot111: I think it’s safe to say that west is better than pray
[3:13:53] thegirlismine: jl SwiftRage
[3:14:05] camelwink: Hey Rusty's back
[3:14:07] TomatoEMT: iG PogChamp
[3:14:10] Art1ficer_: Pray best adc ever
[3:14:12] yousefbruh: homme is teamless now
[3:14:23] Jiml0rd: i haven't seen frosk in awhile
[3:14:23] goblinguy01: RiP
[3:14:26] Art1ficer_: I also agree
[3:14:34] nickthierry: 11TH LUL
[3:14:36] camelwink: @Jiml0rd she casted yesterday
[3:14:36] goblinguy01: World Elite seem lost without him
[3:14:37] shenbot111: Is Keith better than pray? Perhaps
[3:14:52] Dagobert2424: +10 cs average Kreygasm
[3:14:53] Jiml0rd: yea i didn't watch yesterday lol
[3:14:53] camelwink: @Jiml0rd I think she casted VG vs LGD
[3:14:58] Art1ficer_: well aside from imaqtpie, but he's a god so we don't include him in discussions
[3:14:59] michaelsund: Scout MingLee
[3:15:03] TomatoEMT: what is DPM?
[3:15:09] Art1ficer_: it's just not fair
[3:15:13] FlinchFlinch: damage per minute
[3:15:13] shenbot111: Of course click show some respect
[3:15:14] NottinghamSX: Rookie is most overrated mid ever
[3:15:17] goblinguy01: Scout is better than Pawn Kappa
[3:15:23] Art1ficer_: no other adc in the history of dota has stolen krugs
[3:15:24] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod Damage Per Minute
[3:15:27] Art1ficer_: what a play
[3:15:28] Jiml0rd: rookie is not overrated omg don't get me started

[3:15:42] TomatoEMT: oh i see ty
[3:15:42] shenbot111: Guess we will see
[3:15:43] NottinghamSX: yes he is
[3:15:44] Jiml0rd: most underrated mid he is still what 19 or 20 years old
[3:15:53] goblinguy01: Remember Rookie choice to stay in China
[3:15:53] Jiml0rd: won OGN at 17? 18?
[3:15:58] FlinchFlinch: I have to agree rookie is a bit overrated but mainly because mid in China isn't as strong as in other regions
[3:16:00] winwin311: 20
[3:16:00] camelwink: iboy's seriousness tho xD
[3:16:02] Dagobert2424: watch 2014 OGN finals if you think Rookie is overrated LUL
[3:16:05] Art1ficer_: @MakiCSgod are you new to LoL, or just to LoL esports
[3:16:06] goblinguy01: He didn't want to go back to Korea
[3:16:06] NottinghamSX: reddit overrating him so much
[3:16:14] yousefbruh: rookie overrated ? LUL
[3:16:14] FlinchFlinch: he's still like, top 5 in the world probably at his position,
[3:16:20] Jiml0rd: i don't go on reddit
[3:16:20] TomatoEMT: i am new to League
[3:16:25] Art1ficer_: @FlinchFlinch mid in LPL is actually really strong this season
[3:16:28] LegendMaker96: Who won 1st series?
[3:16:31] TomatoEMT: Esports and the Game itself
[3:16:33] Art1ficer_: and in LCK they have 3 good mids, rest are kinda trash

[3:17:20] shenbot111: Didn’t lck start go away flinch
[3:17:24] eat_a__snickers: Rookie ran away from Faker EleGiggle knew he couldnt beat faker on a new team
[3:17:25] goblinguy01: Pawn, Lava, Tempt all worse than Icon and Rookie
[3:17:30] maihu: Remind me of baolan’s champ
[3:17:31] yousefbruh: crown also a good mid
[3:17:37] Surean: knight alone will demolish most of the top mids in other regions
[3:17:37] TomatoEMT: ok after this game i will watch korean league also
[3:17:40] FlinchFlinch: @goblibguy01 thats just wrong lol
[3:17:41] Jiml0rd: even when pawn was in lpl
[3:17:47] Jiml0rd: rookie still solo killed him in lane
[3:17:48] camelwink: JARVAN FOR HARO PLS
[3:17:48] Art1ficer_: LCK has 3 good mids, Faker > Bdd > Kuro
[3:17:50] Itakura_StuGIII: @eat_a__snickers implying Rookie didnt win LCK right before that LUL
[3:17:51] goblinguy01: I forgot the Kappa
[3:17:55] Art1ficer_: rest aren't so good, some are even rather awful
[3:18:00] Dagobert2424: GuoGuo, Scout, Rookie, Icon, Doinb, Xiaohu, Xiye, ...
[3:18:07] yousefbruh: crown is good
[3:18:08] eat_a__snickers: rookie carried by Kakao EleGiggle
[3:18:09] TomatoEMT: is LPL good?
[3:18:10] leavesinwind: theshy GP83%winrate（5/6） gnar100%（4/4）
[3:18:11] NottinghamSX: for me xiye is better than rookie
[3:18:14] FlinchFlinch: guoguo, scout, icon, doinb and xiye are not LCK level mids
[3:18:16] goblinguy01: MVP and BBQ can't even beat VG LUL
[3:18:20] shenbot111: Guoguo is so good though
[3:18:22] camelwink: Ahhhhhh
[3:18:33] michaelsund: doinb? the karma otp lmao
[3:18:33] Art1ficer_: @MakiCSgod yeah, China is the 2nd strongest region, and LPL probably gets the most viewers worldwide cos of Chinese viewership
[3:18:37] Jiml0rd: xiye is lck level mid
[3:18:40] maihu: Xiye is overrated
[3:18:42] Dagobert2424: Guoguo is really good considering it is his first split
[3:18:42] djjohnnymelster: @yousefbruh have you even been watching lck? crown has been this season
[3:18:45] Surean: Xiye is currently possibly the best mid in the league
[3:18:46] DaeKreX: crown hasn't been up to par in a while imo but has shown very good levels in the past
[3:18:47] Art1ficer_: Korea is the strongest region of them all though, and has some of the best games to watch in my opinion
[3:18:50] djjohnnymelster: trash
[3:18:55] Art1ficer_: I watch both LCK and LPL :)
[3:18:55] Jiml0rd: he has actually done really well this season
[3:19:00] TomatoEMT: what about EU and NA?
[3:19:02] Jiml0rd: last season he wasnt
[3:19:03] FlinchFlinch: crown doesn't look as good because LCK got a bunch of good mids now
[3:19:06] shenbot111: I watch all regions lmao
[3:19:07] Art1ficer_: just wait for international events though, they're really good fun
[3:19:12] shenbot111: I just like watching league
[3:19:12] Jiml0rd: this season he is lck level mid him and xiaohu
[3:19:12] vismortis: is that the soloq legends theshy?
[3:19:19] Art1ficer_: EU is the 3rd strongest region, NA is the 4th
[3:19:19] 水原千鶴的老公: Cho ResidentSleeper
[3:19:21] winwin311: Yes
[3:19:23] eat_a__snickers: Crown is just washed up
[3:19:25] NottinghamSX: yep Xiye is the best LPL mid
[3:19:26] michaelsund: MingLee
[3:19:29] yousefbruh: @djjohnnymelster at least he can play good when it matters
[3:19:31] shenbot111: Chogath ResidentSleeper
[3:19:32] nickthierry: LPL just don't have enough good toplaners
[3:19:36] Art1ficer_: south east asia used to be better than NA, but NA is 4th best now
[3:19:42] instapyro33: BRONZIL!!
[3:19:45] FlinchFlinch: I'd say LPL has more good top laners than mid laners
[3:19:47] shenbot111: What do you mean nick
[3:19:47] Jiml0rd: lpl teamplay is just....... off
[3:19:49] TomatoEMT: is there other regions in League that are in pro games?
[3:19:51] michaelsund: @chazzy29 ?
[3:19:51] nickthierry: Riven open PogChamp
[3:19:53] Astragomme: Clunk_Smash to hard to rate NA and EU before international major events.
[3:19:54] velocegravity: Xiaohu gna beat xiye when it matters
[3:19:57] Jiml0rd: they have the individual talent to beat koreans
[3:19:58] shenbot111: They have the best top laner in the whole world mouse
[3:20:01] djjohnnymelster: ksv may not even make playoffs this season lol
[3:20:04] Jiml0rd: but the teamplay they cant or most teams
[3:20:05] shenbot111: Who could compete
[3:20:12] Dagobert2424: LPL have strong adcs
[3:20:13] eat_a__snickers: Crown would Bring out Yasuo and just style on ppl in 2015
[3:20:13] goblinguy01: Samsung is looking bad
[3:20:24] n8dawg707: cho vs ornn ResidentSleeper
[3:20:29] Jiml0rd: i think iG could compete and RNG
[3:20:30] FlinchFlinch: they also have flandere and theshy who are legitimately good top laners, and relatively better than any mid laner in the league
[3:20:31] Art1ficer_: @MakiCSgod the 5 regions I mentioned are the 5 major regions. there are also many minor regions, such as Oceania, Turkey, Brazil, Japan
[3:20:33] GummiGrim: @MakiCSgod Well the way Worlds is arranged, smaller regions compete with themselves to get a spot instead of each of them getting an individual one
[3:20:34] goblinguy01: Pretty sure World Elite and KSV want make it playloffs
[3:20:34] 水原千鶴的老公: IG teamfight picks Kreygasm
[3:20:34] PastMasters: @BraveHeart_TV vn just got their independence from gpl LuL
[3:20:35] 午睡的貓: rdg rw pick LUL

[3:21:03] michaelsund: Sion open 4Head
[3:21:06] NottinghamSX: yeah but I think EDG will win today
[3:21:09] Art1ficer_: @MakiCSgod at international events major regions get automatic entry, minor regions have to play in a seperate playoff first
[3:21:10] yousefbruh: ksv can win playoffs
[3:21:10] shenbot111: Because some of my friends will lose their shit
[3:21:12] Jiml0rd: snake is still ehh they do solo q shit
[3:21:16] velocegravity: @eat_a__snickers crown would bring viktor and ori afk farm playstyle because thats what hes known for and nothing else
[3:21:22] Art1ficer_: @MakiCSgod are you Japanese?
[3:21:41] Jiml0rd: like SOFM plays every game like its solo q
[3:21:43] TomatoEMT: no
[3:21:45] FlinchFlinch: crown gained notoriety from solo killing faker lol
[3:21:51] Dilgi_: will be ez for rookie
[3:21:54] Art1ficer_: why do you play on Japanese server then
[3:21:55] vismortis: iboy is the next weixao VoteAye VoteNay

[3:22:14] Jiml0rd: KZ lol
[3:22:16] FlinchFlinch: KZ has better solo laners
[3:22:18] TomatoEMT: i live in Japan i am from singapore
[3:22:25] djjohnnymelster: I wonder if light will ever play for snake
[3:22:25] FlinchFlinch: so rip iG
[3:22:32] elc4b0ng: WutFace
[3:22:33] shiny_chocobo: VoHiYo

[3:22:52] dtieubinh: WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:22:54] velocegravity: thats wrong he is known for being just a very good player
[3:22:55] FlinchFlinch: :thinking:
[3:22:56] yousefbruh: yes he is
[3:23:10] FlinchFlinch: BBD is also better than rookie imo
[3:23:10] RazkalzMonster: ChaiYo VoHiYo
[3:23:13] Jiml0rd: he is but KHAN's nerves i don't like
[3:23:13] Dilgi_: mechanicly they are even
[3:23:15] NottinghamSX: even Rascal is better than TheShy
[3:23:18] Art1ficer_: not this time I think
[3:23:23] Jiml0rd: he choked at worlds last year
[3:23:32] kocham_disa321: !patch
[3:23:32] Jiml0rd: and had to sit out a game because of a panic attack
[3:23:32] yousefbruh: rascal cant beat theshy
[3:23:44] RobbixFili: 8.3 or 8.4?:s
[3:23:44] Jiml0rd: worlds final of worlds KHAN will choke trust me
[3:23:45] GummiGrim: @kocham_disa321 LPL is playing on 8.2
[3:23:45] kocham_disa321: Which patch is this?
[3:23:46] camelwink: @kocham_disa321 8.2
[3:23:47] Art1ficer_: yeah Khan has been playing since October 2013...people act like he's an up and comer
[3:23:56] kocham_disa321: LOL
[3:24:01] Art1ficer_: he's just finally come into form, but doesn't have much more room to grow. and nerves are really worring at this point...
[3:24:02] Jiml0rd: KHAN played on world elite wtf
[3:24:05] FlinchFlinch: just like khan choked in LCK finals
[3:24:08] GummiGrim: if you're wondering why they're on 8.2 , they had a long break because of Lunar New Year
[3:24:08] Jiml0rd: with spirit when he carried IEM
[3:24:10] 水原千鶴的老公: 62% PogChamp
[3:24:29] Dagobert2424: I dont think LCK players are individually better they just have better Teamplay
[3:24:32] Jiml0rd: no one remembers that
[3:24:43] Jiml0rd: khan was on world elite 2015 when they were awful
[3:24:44] MdwdMw: EDG ADN IG monkaS
[3:24:45] kocham_disa321: Which patch does chinese live server have now?
[3:24:48] Jiml0rd: spirit 1v5 every game
[3:24:55] sorrythaturfat: LUL
[3:24:57] Art1ficer_: yeah Khan's history is not pretty lol
[3:25:01] NottinghamSX: 8.4
[3:25:02] FlinchFlinch: everyone remember that he played in China
[3:25:02] GummiGrim: @kocham_disa321 Pretty sure they're on 8.4
[3:25:12] GummiGrim: @kocham_disa321 I saw a post on Reddit that said they're planning on skipping 8.3 to catch up
[3:25:13] FlinchFlinch: its just he's a god right now and probably the best player in the world atm
[3:25:14] Itakura_StuGIII: CN servers are 8.4, LPL is 8.2
[3:25:17] yousefbruh: hanlabong
[3:25:20] camelwink: Best of two xD
[3:25:24] goblinguy01: Khan was trash in Lspl
[3:25:26] Art1ficer_: it's why people were so down on Khan after worlds, thought he had one flukey split. this split proves he really is that good though
[3:25:28] kocham_disa321: @GummiGrim thanks
[3:25:32] Art1ficer_: weird that he took so long to come into form.
[3:25:32] GummiGrim: The week ends on Monday, so I think that's when the patch will change
[3:25:39] NottinghamSX: i think its 8.4
[3:25:49] Jiml0rd: faker will always be the best player until he retires i am sorry
[3:25:53] FlinchFlinch: smeb was really bad for a while too, players get better
[3:25:58] Art1ficer_: this game is 8.2 cos chinese new year + garena always being behind on patches
[3:25:59] Jiml0rd: we will never a better league player than him
[3:26:03] FlinchFlinch: faker isn't even the best mid in the league right now
[3:26:06] Jiml0rd: smeb was never bad tbh
[3:26:07] vismortis: 34% PogChamp
[3:26:08] Art1ficer_: Faker is the ultimate outlier
[3:26:12] Jiml0rd: he just had bad teams
[3:26:18] Art1ficer_: no one will overtake his status you are correct
[3:26:22] Vasmin1: golden glue is the best mid in the worlds rn
[3:26:25] Art1ficer_: as GOAT
[3:26:26] Jiml0rd: smeb always shined on incredible miracle
[3:26:37] yousefbruh: bdd and kuro is good currently
[3:26:38] FlinchFlinch: smeb fed his ass off on IM
[3:26:42] Jiml0rd: smeb<khan
[3:26:45] Itakura_StuGIII: IM LUL
[3:26:49] FlinchFlinch: he and reignover were considered the two worst players in the league
[3:26:51] Art1ficer_: @BraveHeart_TV yeah people were too hyped on Khan going into worlds, and too down on him coming out. but that's just reddit for ya
[3:26:53] Vasmin1: golden glue is the best mid in the worlds rn
[3:26:54] DaeKreX: yeah smeb was legit shit on im lmao
[3:26:56] shenbot111: IM OMEGALUL
[3:26:56] lilaobayihun88: Why is LPL so small
[3:27:02] Maria0zawa: Bjerg is 2nd best mid in the world Kappa
[3:27:05] DaeKreX: thats why his story was so cool
[3:27:05] Vasmin1: gameover is feeding in NA now LUL
[3:27:06] Art1ficer_: Khan is genuinely good right now though, just remember his team plays around him, and Smebs team don't at all
[3:27:08] yousefbruh: cuvee >khan >smeb
[3:27:19] Art1ficer_: cuvee at worlds maybe.
[3:27:19] FlinchFlinch: cuuvee LUL
[3:27:21] nickthierry: SCOUT FailFish
[3:27:25] Art1ficer_: not anymore really
[3:27:40] FlinchFlinch: cuvee got lucky KZ and SKT imploded at worlds tbh
[3:27:40] GummiGrim: @lilaobayihun88 This is the English stream, and most English viewers are more interested/know Korea
[3:27:41] NottinghamSX: Kiin > all
[3:27:44] lilaobayihun88: ig ig SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[3:27:47] yousefbruh: cuvee is good when his team good
[3:27:57] yousefbruh: but ksv plays poor novadays
[3:28:02] Dagobert2424: Gimgoon is by far the best toplaner
[3:28:14] Art1ficer_: LPL gets the most viewers worldwide @lilaobayihun88
[3:28:15] Vasmin1: khan's ass still hurts from how cuvee kept digging on it at worlds
[3:28:16] goblinguy01: Didn't Bang and Blank throw 4 games at worlds.
[3:28:22] GummiGrim: @lilaobayihun88 LPL actually has the highest viewership, but the Chinese viewers are on other sites
[3:28:25] Art1ficer_: dont let twitch numbers deceive you
[3:28:32] goblinguy01: Bang lost SKT the series against Samsung
[3:28:41] camelwink: @Dagobert2424 no marin hype? xD
[3:28:44] lilaobayihun88: @gummigrim I know there are many people watching because Koreans are champions every time
[3:28:48] apresunday: Most Chinese don't use twitch
[3:28:58] Art1ficer_: Bang was god awful at worlds, Blank was awful at worlds and during this split
[3:29:14] Itakura_StuGIII: @apresunday i'm pretty sure none of them watch LPL on twitch. the "chinese" here are usually taiwanese
[3:29:17] Dagobert2424: @Camelwink ahh yeah forbot about him and his Rfc gnar LUL
[3:29:19] goblinguy01: It wasn't Bang's, E Flash into the wall at Drake? Kappa
[3:29:30] Art1ficer_: saddest part is that SKT pay big salaries to Untara and Blank, because yaknow they are still winners of various events
[3:29:38] Art1ficer_: hence why they couldn't pick up any new good players
[3:29:40] kingkarus: don't use twitch? i though chinese can't use twitch because of firewall?
[3:29:45] 락스피넛짱: LUL
[3:29:45] Itakura_StuGIII: that reset LUL
[3:29:46] Art1ficer_: but they're both so garbage
[3:29:47] apresunday: @Itakura_StuGIII Wrong, I am Chinese. LOL
[3:29:52] naive1207: Yeah, millions of viewers are watching LPL via Chinese platforms
[3:29:59] Dagobert2424: I dont think SKT pays big salarys
[3:30:00] Itakura_StuGIII: @apresunday !
[3:30:03] GummiGrim: @kingkarus I mean that sounds reasonable
[3:30:05] johnnydeft: !patch
[3:30:08] shenbot111: I would watch it on panda but it’s kind of laggy
[3:30:09] Art1ficer_: they can VPN to watch twitch, but why would they?
[3:30:14] Art1ficer_: might as well watch Chinese stream
[3:30:18] Vasmin1: wat pach is this?
[3:30:22] GummiGrim: @Joaopnquintino 8.2
[3:30:22] goblinguy01: "Big Korean Salary" =/= Chinese Salary
[3:30:31] apresunday: GFW doesn't block twitch, but few Chinese know twitch
[3:30:40] Vasmin1: still in 8.2 OMEGALUL
[3:30:43] Art1ficer_: big salary for LCK I meant.
[3:30:52] naive1207: Chinese can access twitch without VPN, only have to suffer low speed and mosaic pics from time to time
[3:30:54] HayabusaTaichou21: @Clunk_Smash for twitch chat, duh Kappa
[3:30:57] Art1ficer_: they don't have crazy billionaire investors throwing away money like in LPL
