No they don't matter since it's the same shit, but when I'm asking for casting in a competetive game and I'm wondering which level the casters are on, do you think I mean if they are diamond which is as far from competetive as you can be?

[2:46:05] Dekharen: @rustythecaster @papasmithy what do you think could be done so that Lee Sin can wardhop again
[2:46:07] TheHybris: @RUSTYTheCASTER the roam potential was actually insane, pretty fun. Or you just stacked 3 Phantom dancer and Lifesteal on him, pressed ult and you'd never die
[2:46:11] kawhiy: Marin 100 death participation 4Head

[2:46:31] GummiGrim: So are their two separate casting teams or do you just do them when it comes up?
[2:46:38] 187juggernaut: @TheHybris PD's and BT's on sion, gg
[2:46:43] RustyTheCaster: We are only 1 casting team so we have to choose!
[2:46:44] Dekharen: or full AP and just press Q LUL
[2:46:48] blikablikaotf: wtf
[2:46:51] TheHybris: @RUSTYTheCASTER good old times, I was young back then, life was easy. AD Sion was good. I miss those times :D
[2:47:03] TheHybris: 187juggernaut yea ^^
[2:47:05] camelwink: @RUSTYTheCASTER are fish and clement casting edg vs rng?
[2:47:15] yam276: I'm not sure if I should have a meal first or keep watching this game
[2:47:25] RustyTheCaster: Ok here's what I would do with Lee Sin - make him have a specific trinket or item like Viktor that provides ward hop slots and is an upgradeable item
[2:47:32] RustyTheCaster: the wards don't give vision, but can be hopped to
[2:47:43] DeadlyGhost96: @rustythecaster remember full AD Sion on top? You had to pick Darius or Tryndamere to match his pressure
[2:47:55] SojuzSoju: @RUSTYTheCASTER but will rito do it? Kappa
[2:47:57] CertainlySomeoneHere: @RUSTYTheCASTER so basically allowing lee to hop to obstacles like illaois' tentacle?
[2:48:01] kawhiy: @rustythecaster that would be too op
[2:48:06] flaava: 5 towers down and other team had no baron wtf? is azir not super good lane clearer
[2:48:13] TheHybris: uh, sounds spicy. I'd be up for that. But they need to be destroyable, with only 1 Autoattack Life. @RUSTYTheCASTER
[2:48:14] whiteb09: wait, does shen get mana coins from his item?
[2:48:23] Dekharen: Yeah I thought about that. But it'd need to be slot efficient and idk how that'd come to be efficient with a bruiser
[2:48:23] GummiGrim: @Dace70 I remember facing off against top Alistar when that was OP, that was a pretty hard match up LUL
[2:48:25] RustyTheCaster: ya for sure, make it trinket hp and give no vision
[2:48:32] Linko98: @RUSTYTheCASTER have you played on the super server?
[2:48:34] RustyTheCaster: charges could also increase over time or over upgrades from 1 to 3
[2:48:37] whatizsupp: tp-able to?
