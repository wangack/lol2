[2:45:09] DeuSaNctuS: comparing SKT with TSM in 2k18 LUL its like comparing champions with losers still LUL
[2:45:12] 琴強尼: Be honest. LMS is too weak

[2:48:34] neonapollo99: @tenac1tas it's sarcasm and yes
[2:48:38] djjohnnymelster: clg has to win both games
[2:48:45] mujarshad: bs, tsm will lose to half the lpl and 8/10 of the lck teams, they have no significant improvement over previous years
[2:48:47] Nagare765: no counterplay for bo1 LUL
[2:48:55] scottoflorida2014: @tenac1tas No, I meant you are right. No sarcasm at all
[2:48:56] FlinchFlinch: it'll be funny if EF makes MSI and gets demolished by everyone, because bo1 is a joke

[2:54:06] 伊車組長: TriHard 4Head
[2:54:07] tr4dy: The main issue with EU right now is Bo1, I think this is a bad format to improve
[2:54:07] scottoflorida2014: @tr4dy In their own region, wait till they face competition. That's the problem. EU is weak this year
[2:54:08] Boris0w0: haha, you don't want korean to win so why not Oceania?
[2:54:14] Dalek_Zoey: KZ will fail, given a bad Patch/meta

[2:55:41] OpaqueHeart: KT are way too beatable. What are you on about. I believe they'll go to worlds but they won't be dominant.
[2:55:47] 琴強尼: 現在到底是KT比較強還是KZ

[2:55:59] mujarshad: KZ > AFS > KT
[2:56:02] 德麗耶耶: KZ目前還是比較強
[2:56:03] FlinchFlinch: but KT can lose to KSV, KZ and Afreeca
[2:56:06] 臺南余文樂: KT很不穩
[2:56:07] Warwizard23: Kreygasm
[2:56:19] scottoflorida2014: @tr4dy I think G2 is the best in EU, they just hit a bad streak
[2:56:19] 不怕鞭炮的年: kz比kt強的不是一點半點我覺得
[2:56:23] 德麗耶耶: 但KZ上次世界賽烙賽了 還是不能講死
