[5:25:41] otrozurdo: BBQ TRADE 1 kill on smeb for a bot lane tower, just EXPOSEEED poor macro play
[5:26:22] otrozurdo: im done with KT vs BBQ, just no point on the sauce
[5:26:40] otrozurdo: thats not the secrect sauce of grandma
[5:28:45] light666speed: BLG的先手打成这样！
[5:28:46] Scen0fU: lol yagao
[5:29:32] iyedol72: EDG
[5:30:16] Scen0fU: EDG won
[5:30:27] iyedol72: bearly
[5:30:32] otrozurdo: yagao got exposed
[5:30:52] otrozurdo: Once again YDB xD
[5:31:25] Arcturus075: Libertese same also I don't know why ignar likes to pick leona, its never looked good and when behind it does nothing...and he always falls behind on it
[5:32:55] otrozurdo: yah, @Arcturus075 but leona is a strong pick, just maybe not in hands on ignar, but you had to give him some respect to keep trying xD never surrender xD
[5:33:27] Baldier3: I'm so out of touch, didn't clid play for WE
[5:33:28] Scen0fU: maybe just he uesd leona to be famoues in S7
[5:33:51] otrozurdo: Leona is pretty badass earlygame,
[5:34:10] Dagobert2424: Clid played for QG
[5:34:25] Scen0fU: but its so hard to do good in teamfight
[5:34:30] otrozurdo: if you get a snowball, you can win every single objective with her , is like a more safe alistar i feel like
[5:34:52] Scen0fU: especially enemies have flash
[5:34:58] Baldier3: Clid/condi, i confused the 2
[5:35:11] one_more_plz: why is leona more safe than alistar
[5:35:17] Arcturus075: In this season and his time in the LCK its left so much to be desired and I think it should generally in pro play used against rakan where it seems strongest....speak of the devil this match and bbq vs kt have the same kill score 1-6 and similar gold leads
[5:35:27] Scen0fU: JDG is QG
[5:36:13] mujarshad: whenever baron is on the map, jdg has a mental boom
[5:36:16] otrozurdo: yes , i give you that, is hard to execute, but you are in the "best region" so hard to execute isnt really priority sometimes,
[5:36:30] light666speed: condi plays for WE, but recently his dad died, condi haven't plaied for several games
[5:36:55] Scen0fU: but pro player will not teamfoght if they dont have flash
[5:37:11] Scen0fU: so leona useless in lategame
[5:37:17] otrozurdo: Leona snowball isnt that hard to execute, but on late game gets harder
[5:37:18] Arcturus075: I just think it should be used as a counter pick like mf support into zyra, i mean thresh, tahm, and ali just easily counter everything she does and those three everyone in pro play is good with
[5:38:12] otrozurdo: @Arcturus075 agree, leona as counterpick is more viable that just straigth to her,
[5:38:36] Scen0fU: but ignar pick her for no reason
[5:39:06] Scen0fU: just because she made he be famous
[5:39:18] otrozurdo: yah, agree, he want to be the star, so hes watching the stars arround his head like a cartoon xD
[5:39:40] Arcturus075: yeah he just believes in the pick and will blind pick into anything, and that WOMBO COMBO by JDG
[5:40:13] otrozurdo: @Arcturus075 yo buddy it worked on Bronce 3 promo xD monkaS
[5:40:39] Arcturus075: I stand corrected ScaredyCat
[5:40:42] otrozurdo: EZ B3 Promo
[5:41:41] otrozurdo: i want to see Aphromoo Leona on 8.5
[5:42:15] otrozurdo: hes one of the best supports in the world, no jk
[5:42:34] Scen0fU: best sup NA
[5:42:42] otrozurdo: thats for sure
[5:43:07] otrozurdo: not anyone on NA even close to his macro and tf understanding
[5:43:19] otrozurdo: on support role of course
[5:43:32] Arcturus075: I think Bio and smoothie are comparable though
[5:43:37] one_more_plz: smoothie is really good though
[5:43:47] mujarshad: just do the baron???? there's no jg....
[5:43:49] light666speed: I think Ming is best sup in lpl
