[6:00:24] Surean: TSM will probably rank below the top 3 from the LPL and around KSV in the LCK
[6:00:30] freeko: I dont think TSM beats CG in playoffs tbh
[6:00:32] andyge777: Sneaky isnt enough to carry C9. Licorice gets caught out and jensen hasnt been pulling his weight

[6:01:31] yoshiharudavid: Marin was there tho that's why I support TOP
[6:01:40] FRZCheetah: Honestly in NA I think you can say who is strong right now.
[6:01:42] freeko: franchising is a REALLY BAD idea, and you will see it in a few years where there are a few competitive teams and then the rest of the league is glorified academy teams

[6:17:21] FRZCheetah: NA technically has three leagues now
[6:17:21] DuckStorm: so this is over.
[6:17:22] Acidrain18769: @Dagobert2424 that is not why franchising exists.. it exists solely to protect millions of dollars of investments
[6:17:26] freeko: if they dont have the players, they shouldnt need to worry about relegation then because the teams that would challenge for their spot just dont have the skill that the teams already installed do
