[1:06:05] scottoflorida2014: @ChaadOri His nerves were probably so hyped, let him get used to being on stage
[1:06:31] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: a bunch of stunnas
[1:06:45] RustyTheCaster: @lipefuark huh?
[1:06:46] Stormquake: TL will win and complete the prophecy of being the 4th team to win NALCS gggW
[1:06:58] liftedLiquid: @scottofl2014 maybe he need more time.. he will be fine this summer split

[1:07:01] scottoflorida2014: 100T wins ;)
[1:07:10] HUUUUURZ: I'm not a fan of TSM. But i do like myself some clean, crisp and spicy gameplay. And I have to say that the team closest to this critera is indeed TSM.
[1:07:11] PapaSmithy: Guys every time I read The Shy's name it looks like theshy

[1:07:27] Mishimatic: @PapaSmithy Glad it's not just me
[1:07:30] Stormquake: Unsure where I rank NA right now... I think it's KR > CN = NA > EU
[1:07:35] RustyTheCaster: When he was first announce it was written as Theshy
[1:07:37] NEGAOdoTHOMAS: hi guys

[1:08:07] PapaSmithy: Snake
[1:08:07] erogical: Snake
[1:08:09] Stormquake: but I think CN is best at raw teamfighting
[1:08:11] Divinebagel: SASS
[1:08:14] Stormquake: and then KR is... KR
[1:08:20] camelwink: @MrStormquake i havent watched EU and KR but i reckon in terms of MSI it would be KR < CN < NA not sureabout EU
[1:08:20] NEGAOdoTHOMAS: Snake
[1:08:23] koreancrispy: is imp retired
[1:08:27] ogremoch: @RUSTYTheCASTER how do you rank the four teams left in playoffs in NA
[1:08:27] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: he doesnt look that sassy but i'll trust pulse

[1:09:20] mujarshad: theyshy BM Kreygasm
[1:09:23] lzanaa: oh rel
[1:09:24] heartbraek: I think if tsm banned thresh they would be playing in miami
[1:09:29] camelwink: @MrStormquake not with how dominant IG is xD
[1:09:35] FatalSajko: theshy and flandre have ASS tobiasOK

[1:10:08] ogremoch: IG has a big chance
[1:10:11] soakedintorment: @MrStormquake yes, but thru bot lane only
[1:10:13] GodzThirdLeg: @MrStormquake Well until the next international tournament we can only speculate, who is better.
[1:10:17] camelwink: @MrStormquake i think they can take a game but probably not a series just from what ive heard from analysts
[1:10:36] koreancrispy: jeez ig is smurfing
[1:10:37] Stormquake: I wish I could have caught more LPL this split
[1:10:37] soakedintorment: @Camelwink so no offense then but you don't think, you repeat
[1:10:43] ogremoch: if Khan wins lane, he can hard carry

[1:11:31] soakedintorment: @MrStormquake ahh i was so bummed about that
[1:11:38] 臺南余文樂: So Theshy is Korean?
[1:11:40] soakedintorment: @MrStormquake made late games in the midwest even later
[1:11:44] Stormquake: Khan is strong, but I think you can tilt him
[1:11:46] RustyTheCaster: The match should be starting in approximately 4 minutes, on Monday the Chinese broadcast goes through all major regions standings
[1:11:48] ACMastrpiece: hakuYes
[1:12:01] RustyTheCaster: So they take an extra couple of minutes
[1:12:04] Stormquake: Didn't Khan have a panic attack after the first game he lost in LCK?
[1:12:06] PoliticalMuffin: Are they still doing the weighted bo5 for playoffs?
[1:12:11] ominousiA: Mouse?
[1:12:11] mujarshad: did they announce that tsm lost?

[1:12:18] heartbraek: thanks rusty
[1:12:20] ogremoch: @MrStormquake that's a normal thing with players with carry personalities
[1:12:20] Stormquake: That won't be good if it happens when they no longer have a top sub
[1:12:21] UnrankedSoloQ: HeyGuys
[1:12:31] ACMastrpiece: hakuNo
[1:12:36] canismajoris80: TSM EleGiggle
[1:12:38] Stormquake: if KZ still had a top sub, it would be somewhat ok, but alas
[1:12:39] RustyTheCaster: @UnrankedSoloQ glad you enjoy, we're viewers just like yall!
[1:12:51] ogremoch: @MrStormquake it'll be up to both his teammates and coaching staff to rein in his tilt

[1:13:30] Vatler: @rustythecaster is it true the ladies call you the 10 inch terror?

[1:16:21] ominousiA: IG vs KZ
[1:16:23] lzanaa: Can RW make msi???
[1:16:23] HUUUUURZ: I'm not a fan of TSM. But i do like myself some clean, crisp and spicy gameplay. And I have to say that the team closest to this critera is indeed TSM.

[1:17:59] RustyTheCaster: I'd probably be choosing between IG and RW for coach of the split
[1:18:06] soakedintorment: @Danielchoder also teddy would crush on a better team. guy is a monster who always manages to build an advantage for himself no matter what

[1:29:17] RustyTheCaster: I mean Kai'Sa just does so much damage so if she's ever ahead it does crazy work

[1:31:46] 安齋らら: 光之陣亡
[1:32:03] RustyTheCaster: I think he's a top 3 pick, perhaps not the strongest
[1:32:09] Stormquake: Swain is a cool champ, even if he's pretty op right now
[1:32:19] Stormquake: I love how his Vision ability works
[1:32:33] soakedintorment: @RUSTYTheCASTER the strongest being who in your opinion?

[1:32:35] koreancrispy: is rookier better than doinb?
[1:32:37] Stormquake: I believe Swain is getting his Q cd nerfed
[1:32:45] Stormquake: which is fine, I think
[1:32:50] Stormquake: would rather have CD nerfs as opposed to damage
[1:33:22] RustyTheCaster: Swains strongest because of his Flex

[1:33:51] ray10330221: 光之開殺
[1:33:53] FK_P: doinb makes the players around him play better
[1:34:05] RustyTheCaster: It's unlikely we'll see Quinn still but I'm excited to test her out when China patches to 8.6
[1:34:05] soakedintorment: @RUSTYTheCASTER i guess azir is just perma banned so its hard as a viewer to grasp the strength of that pick

[2:25:32] DukeFlukem: for a moment I thought it was a replay
[2:25:36] cvkarrosh: That's because LPL isn't usually as interesting. Watch a LCK game and then watch an LPL game. It's like wathcing Silver vs Challenger.
[2:25:38] FK_P: pause the game and kill the opponent when he's not paying attention, good strategy
