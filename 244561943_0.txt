[0:39:48] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: @VisLaud_RlyTho didn't know that. if that's true outside of playoffs, why have multiple conferences?
[0:40:39] CaptainHero1: Some of the teams have their own arenas I believe
[0:40:50] CaptainHero1: and they also play the same conference twice and the other once
[0:41:01] RustyTheCaster: Yup!
[0:41:07] jzeeeee123: so many games
[0:41:10] RustyTheCaster: Cross conference occurs once in the middle of the split
[0:41:23] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: interesting. Isn't lpl the only one with conferences though? seems sorta odd.
[0:41:23] RustyTheCaster: But don't worry, "So many games"? We're adding more teams!
[0:41:33] Pillsbury_Doughboy: o.O so there's still another whole lpl split after this one?
[0:41:38] RustyTheCaster: We're franchised with stadiums and conferences based off their geo location
[0:41:56] RustyTheCaster: it makes sense really, we have a literal geographic east and west
[0:42:08] neeV3: where are EDG and IG stadiums at?
[0:42:18] RustyTheCaster: Currently they're both still in Shanghai
[0:42:21] RustyTheCaster: this is a foreplanning thing
[0:42:44] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: seems a bit odd to do given it's a digital game. Having physical large stadiums seems sorta expensive.
[0:42:49] RustyTheCaster: We have stadiums in Chongqing (Snake) Hangzhou (LGD) Chengdu (OMG) and Shanghai
[0:42:50] hoboxpanda: sounds amazing
[0:42:54] neeV3: but do we know where their locations will be?

[4:21:06] EnderForHegemon: OmegaLuL
[4:21:11] loatheyy: They waited until the finish of the previous game to begin casting this one. When they're at different venues there's a set time for the game to start - they don't wait for another game somewhere else to finish since that would suck for the fans.
[4:21:44] Gunerdrag: BLG wins ResidentSleeper
[4:22:07] EnderForHegemon: There are two games in the same league at the same time?
[4:22:33] ThorbenTK: @EnderForHegemon would make sense because theres West and East Division
[4:22:42] happyface132: This is weird
[4:22:42] loatheyy: I think when it goes to 3 games there's a chance they overlap, yeah. Happens when they're playing in different stadiums.

[4:22:58] happyface132: Is this game 2 or game 1
[4:23:06] FlipperMeTimbers: @enderforhegemon nah they werent scheduled at the same time. They schedule it for the first game to go 2-0 then second game starts

[4:23:13] happyface132: Where is game 2
