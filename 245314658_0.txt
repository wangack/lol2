[0:15:54] goblinguy01: IG, LongZhu, and TL are going to MSI
[0:16:17] goblinguy01: SKT can't beat LongZhu, and Huni choked in NA 4Head

[0:17:22] goblinguy01: Yep. Too bad Rookie is going to smash BBD
[0:17:26] Ziggurist: Huni did fine, he just didn't have the right team comp around him
[0:17:31] goblinguy01: But Khan is too OP
[0:17:38] goblinguy01: Nah. NA teams are bas
[0:17:38] Ziggurist: He had a couple of bad ins, but mostly got left out by Fox
[0:17:47] goblinguy01: bad. Junior needs to go back to Korea
[0:18:02] Ziggurist: I think TL has a chance to compete against other regions
[0:18:08] Ziggurist: Seems as if they're a strong team
[0:18:14] goblinguy01: Khan vs Rookie is the real match up xD
[0:18:15] vhcent: lol
[0:18:20] goblinguy01: Let's game lane swaps!
[0:18:41] goblinguy01: @rngsigler The Shy is good :D
[0:18:55] goblinguy01: I can't be biased to the LPL as a fan
[0:19:16] goblinguy01: JackeyLove needs to troll on Draven again
[0:19:46] goblinguy01: A troll game where their first place seed is locked in
[0:20:08] goblinguy01: JackeyLove pulls out Draven assist 5th/6th place team
[0:20:17] goblinguy01: against*
[0:20:44] Ziggurist: Y'all think SKT is going to push through the next 2 games to make it to the championship game? Kappa
[0:20:49] goblinguy01: I think Fnatic and Liquid will try
[0:21:00] goblinguy01: I can't say NA or EU won't win a single game
[0:21:16] Ziggurist: I think TL is stronger than Fnatic imo
[0:21:23] goblinguy01: @rngsigler I see your name baby KappaPride
[0:21:51] devildluffy: hi
[0:21:58] Ziggurist: They needed to work on their early game, and their game showed today that they have been, TL is the strongest team in na/eu right now
[0:22:08] goblinguy01: I'm a Chinese fanboy since IPL5. Fzzf and WeiXaio Kreygasm
[0:22:15] devildluffy: TSM cant win without DL
[0:22:28] devildluffy: DL is the problem
[0:22:30] Ziggurist: Nope
[0:22:37] Ziggurist: Especially in the meta of the bot lane
[0:22:55] goblinguy01: TL can beat any team if they get a lead and the other team tilts. I'm not discounting NA too early
[0:23:02] Ziggurist: Better bot lane wins, a top laner can't carry unlike 8.1-8.2
[0:23:43] goblinguy01: @rngsigler Yeaj. I <3 PDD, Fzzf, WeiXaio, Uzi, NaMei, GoGoing and Loveling
[0:23:46] devildluffy: u cant always get lead
[0:23:54] Ziggurist: So, each region has their LCS finals then they go to MSI right?
[0:23:55] goblinguy01: Real LPL fan since end of S2 lol
[0:23:56] devildluffy: U need to know how to play from behind
[0:24:06] AnimeKingNZ: why such long countdown timers?? soooo dumb
[0:24:08] devildluffy: thats why Korean team is good at
[0:24:13] goblinguy01: @rngsigler Rekkles tilts hard
[0:24:39] devildluffy: Rekkles is one of the best western adc for sure
[0:24:41] goblinguy01: I don't see IG titling that hard, Rookie won't allow it
[0:24:44] Ziggurist: Tbh, if SKT makes it to the lck championship game, I'll be impressed
[0:24:50] goblinguy01: Rookie is the adopted son of China for a reason
[0:25:11] devildluffy: I dont think its possible
[0:25:22] goblinguy01: I can see TL losing to China #2 Taiwan, Vietnam or Türkiye
[0:25:29] devildluffy: Hes good for sure
[0:25:34] goblinguy01: Same for EU, but not China
[0:25:38] AnimeKingNZ: st have lost all mojo
[0:25:44] AnimeKingNZ: *skt
[0:25:55] Ziggurist: Their recent games have been okay
[0:26:01] goblinguy01: Intara and Blank are bad together
[0:26:08] Ziggurist: Almost threw it last night though
[0:26:10] goblinguy01: Blossom plays way too aggro
[0:26:20] devildluffy: u mean consistency of their team play?
[0:26:21] Ziggurist: They need to put wolf back in and let blank play his zac game
[0:26:30] Cindella: how come there was alot of talk about dl, did something happen
[0:26:33] rudeoff: same faker is pretty washed up at this point
[0:26:35] devildluffy: TL maybe can win the final
[0:26:48] devildluffy: the team have a chance to win a final
[0:26:49] Ziggurist: I believe TL is the strongest NA team right now
[0:26:53] axendol: hope Snake loses today also! @LPL1
[0:27:01] Ziggurist: TSM was the only other team that could have contested them
[0:27:03] devildluffy: maybe
[0:27:16] goblinguy01: @rngsigler My favorite team, S4 EDG - NaMei, Fzzf, Koro1, Clear LUL and U. U and Fzzf were my favorite players before the Koreans joined EDG
[0:27:17] AnimeKingNZ: i think faker just losty his will after losing at worlds
[0:27:17] devildluffy: I felt TSM will come back next season
[0:27:25] Cindella: i mean, i guess i hope snake loses as well, cause then edg have solid foothold
[0:27:27] devildluffy: Faker is tilted
[0:27:31] Ziggurist: TSM will be fine
[0:27:38] Ziggurist: Faker is mad that he doesn't have a team around him
[0:27:42] devildluffy: bang's world performance tilted Faker hard
[0:27:44] Ziggurist: However his tilt is showing
[0:28:00] goblinguy01: Blossom and Effort go too deep and feed
[0:28:04] devildluffy: yup SKT should rebuild around Faker
[0:28:10] AnimeKingNZ: yeah its really showing :(...
[0:28:17] AnimeKingNZ: i agre @cloudayss
[0:28:22] AnimeKingNZ: *agree
[0:28:24] Ziggurist: They just need a set in stone support player
[0:28:30] goblinguy01: If Intara, Blossom and Effort feed. How can SKt win?
[0:28:43] Cindella: is faker still the god hes been before though, and if not will he even be if he untilts?
[0:28:45] goblinguy01: Dude, SKT lost to BBQ, Jin Air, MVP
[0:28:45] devildluffy: hard to say
[0:28:49] Ziggurist: I'm not an agree Kappa
[0:28:53] AnimeKingNZ: wolf was a good supp for them tho??
[0:29:01] Ziggurist: They also just beat Rox
[0:29:07] Ziggurist: Now they have to beat KT
[0:29:13] goblinguy01: Rookie and Faker are close xD
[0:29:30] Ziggurist: I think faker has the game sense, rookie has the reactions
[0:29:31] goblinguy01: Let's see if Rookie can drag Effort and Thal/Intara to MSI
[0:29:39] devildluffy: Rookie is good
[0:29:39] goblinguy01: Faker* LUL
[0:29:47] devildluffy: but Rookie needs a chance to prove himself
[0:29:52] Efrain1731: GO SKT
[0:29:57] Cindella: gob, u mean in skill lvl right?
[0:29:57] goblinguy01: Rookie has beaten faker in the past

[0:31:45] devildluffy: Easyhoon is washup
[0:31:52] goblinguy01: Well, KT can tilt hard
[0:32:15] goblinguy01: KT lost to AHQ aka EDG #3 at Rift rivals LUL
[0:32:24] goblinguy01: Deft tilts so hard
[0:32:48] goblinguy01: Deft and Pawn are former EDG players - they can tilt 4Head
[0:33:15] goblinguy01: The EDG curse mate
[0:33:15] Cindella: reading this chat makes me sad, due to short term memory loss i cant remember anything specific about the teams so i cant think about any of these specific stuff

[0:33:50] devildluffy: i mean
[0:33:51] goblinguy01: When Deft and Pawn left EDG, and tilted in KT
[0:33:57] goblinguy01: What's new?
[0:33:59] Cindella: gob, i cry every time i see edg make it so far then just crash an burn
[0:34:23] goblinguy01: I miss Pre-Korean EDG TableHere
[0:34:42] devildluffy: they suck
[0:34:48] devildluffy: best finish
[0:34:50] goblinguy01: Deft had a game where he was 0/0/0 and they lost in KT. He did the same for EDG
[0:35:03] goblinguy01: It's the players not the Team
[0:35:16] goblinguy01: Scout inted really hard xD
[0:35:20] devildluffy: mental problems are holding them back

[0:52:41] weebonduty: PogChamp
[0:52:54] goblinguy01: It makes me wonder why no Korean teams picked up DoinB, the shy or rookie?
[0:53:08] goblinguy01: I'm sure KT was looking for a replacement to Fly 4Head
[0:53:12] diegorubinakes: hahahaha

[0:53:56] goblinguy01: They arrive making money but, how would The Shy or DoinB deny a spot in SKT?
[0:54:13] goblinguy01: How many players would say to being a bench warmer and winning a world title LUL
[0:54:15] Sov25: @goblibguy01 you say that like they could get spot for top tier teams
[0:54:37] Shrekkles: scout lefr skt sub for china
[0:55:00] goblinguy01: Scout was taught by the LPL, much like DoinB, the Shy and others

[0:56:36] goblinguy01: @sov25 Scout play does not resemble Korea. It's all I'm saying
[0:56:47] leon99671: it's in Taiwanese Kappa
[0:56:59] goblinguy01: It's fair to say, "Scout, DoinB, and the Shy were trained by the LPL"
[0:57:03] Sov25: @goblibguy01 are you dumb?

[0:59:48] Fatu_Family: yet Na cant beat china nor korea so idk about terrible macro play so dont fight over something like that
[1:00:01] Ziggurist: I think TL stands a chance
[1:00:13] Sov25: @C9Yoshi no one is talking about NA
[1:00:15] Ziggurist: But that's the only NA team I see doing anything
[1:00:19] Sov25: CN does have terrible macro play
[1:00:26] SinCross: i feel like LPL casters get too much flak. i really enjoy watching them
[1:00:32] goblinguy01: TL can upset Korea or China like 20%
[1:00:41] Fatu_Family: @sov25 u seem to be getting fussy over me sayin stuff bud
[1:00:52] Ziggurist: They just need to play like they did today and they'll be fine
[1:00:57] goblinguy01: If Khan ints and feeds. Pray needs a bad game for KZ to lose at MSI

[1:36:42] thresh4dayz: why would shen bother ulting that?
[1:36:43] Sov25: who said he's the best in the world again?
[1:36:52] keepootl: I did
[1:37:05] Laphx: that isn't the champions fault
[1:37:07] Sov25: oh yea i forgot april fools, good one keepootl
[1:37:09] EmilyNami: Everybody is banning xayah or rakan
[1:37:10] ACMastrpiece: natalie imbruglia nice bigfatLEL
[1:37:10] skomie: danO
[1:37:14] LlamaCheese: LOL
[1:37:14] Laphx: that is moles brains fault
[1:37:22] etiennelebeau: Is that Natalie Imbruglia references? lolz
[1:37:35] Voota: veravoCreep
[1:37:37] Blacksun42: happy april fools day
[1:37:39] kafkaesquedjg: Natalie Imbruglia reference!
[1:37:44] Blacksun42: Kappa
[1:38:02] twilek321: i think mole thinks that r will get him away and he doesnt understand that he comes back to the same spot
[1:38:34] LilShortstuf: Anyone know who the casters are for this set?
[1:38:36] Hardlessdaimio: who said Jiizuke is best Taliyah LUL
[1:38:41] Laphx: fish and rusty
[1:38:50] LilShortstuf: Thanks
[1:39:00] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: EU/NA fans are so delusional LUL
[1:39:01] 83749394793: jankos is best
[1:39:08] Blacksun42: I think jiizuke is a solid mid player
[1:39:10] EmilyNami: Poor Jiizuke :(
[1:39:19] Blacksun42: his team tho Kappa
[1:39:20] kiwiininja123: Jizuke best rookie
[1:39:25] thresh4dayz: i certainly hope no one said jizuke was best at anything (in the world)
[1:39:29] Hardlessdaimio: Vitality was overrated
[1:39:46] kiwiininja123: Jizuke just carried their team
[1:39:53] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: Same is FNC
[1:39:58] thresh4dayz: were they really? it seems like they're gonna be right around where most analysts predicted them
[1:40:00] Laphx: western regions overrating their teams, name a more iconic duo
[1:40:02] mujarshad: @Hardlessdaimio Amazing said that Jebaited
[1:40:03] thresh4dayz: if not a bit higher
[1:40:04] Hardlessdaimio: they had luck that they came that far
[1:40:07] EmilyNami: The guy could not play today.
[1:40:20] Sov25: @iammeni CN teams being overrated at worlds LUL
[1:40:29] Laphx: @Sov25 true LUL
[1:40:29] Gunerdrag: TriHard
[1:40:37] BarnaIdo: sup noobs
[1:40:37] Blacksun42: I think this year CN teams would do well
[1:40:47] Blacksun42: because of the meta changes
[1:40:48] Laphx: i think china is going to do well every year
[1:40:51] twilek321: every region should think there teams are the best if they didnt why cheer in the first place
[1:40:53] Laphx: and every year i'm fucking wrong
[1:40:57] Hardlessdaimio: Comedy Network Kappa ?
[1:41:01] Blacksun42: they get rid of the wards Kappa
[1:41:03] kiwiininja123: Na This Eu, Korean this China That...I don't care I enjoy watching good players and plays
[1:41:04] Sov25: @Blacksun42 the meta at S7 was their best one ever and they still lost
[1:41:10] mujarshad: pretty sure fnatic wouldn't be a top 5 team in lpl Jebaited
[1:41:18] thresh4dayz: @123Kappa3 that logic doesnt make any sense, in no way is every region equal
[1:41:25] Laphx: I also enjoy watching good players and good plays, that's why I don't watch europe
[1:41:30] keepootl: im pretty sure that rogue warriors at least is gonna have very little international success
[1:41:39] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: Well tell me what EU/NA has accomplished, both are trash regions LUL
[1:41:46] twilek321: thresh4dayz then why cheer for your region if you think there going to lose
[1:41:47] EmilyNami: China is good. But it seems korea is in another level
[1:41:51] Herrsch_: Spire Minigame
[1:41:55] Sov25: As long as the meta isn't where janna is first pick we gucci
[1:42:01] kiwiininja123: Eruope isn't that bad LUL people talk in this chat like they're better, if you're better go play on LCK yourself and carry EU
[1:42:02] thresh4dayz: @123Kappa3 i dont cheer for a region, i cheer for good league of legends play
[1:42:04] Hardlessdaimio: Ive always hope that a china team will rise again like WE was 4-5 years ago
[1:42:06] kiwiininja123: LUL
[1:42:19] Herrsch_: But tank meta has shifted into carry top laners
[1:42:20] Blacksun42: @Sov25 I mean, it's possible
[1:42:30] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: At least CN is just behind KR, NA and EU are trash
[1:42:38] 菁蛙: @iammeni maybe IG could upset KR teams this year
[1:42:40] twilek321: thresh4dayz then why watch lpl they have the most confusing games if you want good league wach korea i guess
[1:42:41] FederationOnFire: complaining in chat LUL
[1:42:49] Sov25: @Blacksun42 nah they got chewed for letting ardent censor being busted at worlds. they typically dont make the same mistake again.
[1:43:14] Blacksun42: @Sov25 do u think RNG had a chance against S4 SSW? OMEGALUL
[1:43:17] Laphx: @菁蛙 lmao I'm with you, I have a lot of excitement in seeing IG internationally, and vs korean teams
[1:43:21] thresh4dayz: @123Kappa3 so if im making predictions i have some context. i wont just automatically call NA/EU trash if i havent even watched their games
[1:43:25] Blacksun42: they have improved bit by bit
[1:43:32] corbenharris01: Facepalm so bad
[1:43:36] 83749394793: gg
[1:43:39] Sov25: @Blacksun42 no way but not sure why you're asking that
[1:43:41] MdwdMw: ZOE POGGERS
[1:43:44] Hardlessdaimio: O.o that focus was no focus LUL
[1:43:47] EmilyNami: Ardent sensor meta was so boring. hyper carries tanks and.late game
[1:43:55] thesalos: scuttle saving Chelly like twice
[1:43:55] KuroNeko0203: Z LUL E
[1:44:06] Som2freak: POGGERS
[1:44:07] EmilyNami: late game*
[1:44:12] corbenharris01: That chase though
[1:44:14] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: One of the most confusing thing about lpl is that they were always patches behind, which fucked them over at worlds.
[1:44:21] twilek321: thresh4dayz im just saying region pride is a thing and saying that it makes no sense is just not true
[1:44:22] Sov25: @GlennRRB agreed. you know you screwed up when sejuani(afk farm pre 6) and janna(most reactive sup) are S tier picks lol
[1:44:22] Blacksun42: @Sov25 I mean LPL are improving as a region, and it is enhanced by the meta right now
[1:44:28] Herrsch_: "Sprinting"
[1:44:30] EMP_Vince_McMahon: 19 kills in 25 mins...must be LPL LUL
[1:44:55] Hardlessdaimio: @EMP_Vince_McMahon it can be better if more kills than play time LUL
[1:44:56] Laphx: I actually love how supportive NA fans are every year, how every year they still have hope and hype for international events
[1:45:11] thresh4dayz: @123Kappa3 sure, i just think it's useless, especially if there's nothing to be proud of.
[1:45:13] Sov25: @Blacksun42 I mean it took letting a busted item into worlds for them to get their best result lol
[1:45:18] keepootl: yea this is a classic case of playing to not lose by omg

[1:45:50] Blacksun42: @Sov25 I actually don't think ardent is a good meta for china lol
[1:45:59] MangoKangaroo: !patch
[1:46:00] Moobot: This is patch 8.5 POGGERS
[1:46:00] Laphx: ardent is a good meta for WE
[1:46:07] kingbaby: uhh its only been this split that LPL has been behind in patches, i dont remember them ever beeing this behind in the scheduling and it doesnt really affect worlds neways....
[1:46:07] Hardlessdaimio: btw happy easter everyone :D
[1:46:08] acc_rasp: voltei amores
[1:46:11] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: LPL's playstyle should be good against KR's, but their teams threw so hard and blew the game open for the KR's
[1:46:26] twilek321: thresh4dayz i mean people enjoy rooting for their teams its not hard to understand. if you just root for who ever is favored thats boring and not entertaining poeple want to see the upset
[1:46:31] Herrsch_: I'm surprised no one has played Kaisa yet
[1:46:32] MattzaBallz: happeh Zombie Jesus Day
[1:46:35] Blacksun42: @Sov25 it still is based on team fighting and LPL is good at skirmishes
[1:46:36] Laphx: LPL playstyle is bad against kr actually @helpmepleeeeese
[1:46:40] Sov25: @Blacksun42 playing deathball comp with utility mid, 2 front line. enchanter support, late game adc? LUL that's a LPL meta
[1:46:57] Herrsch_: Is NA/EU not in 8.6
[1:47:03] mujarshad: jiekou stop inting NotLikeThis
[1:47:07] Laphx: na and eu are on 8.5 i think
[1:47:09] Sov25: @Blacksun42 that was a meta where mid/jg took zero skill, jg had catch up exp, janna/lulu were top tier picks overall
[1:47:12] thresh4dayz: @123Kappa3 yeah, i understand it. I just dont subscribe to it
[1:47:16] Herrsch_: Oh, was gonna say
[1:47:21] EMP_Vince_McMahon: NA and EU are on 8.5 for the playoffs
[1:47:22] Hardlessdaimio: That shen does a great job
[1:47:22] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: @iammeni no i think its good but the teams made the stupidest mistakes
[1:47:29] CYBERBOOLI__xD: POGGERS
[1:47:29] Herrsch_: Ahh
[1:47:39] Herrsch_: No Kaisa play yet until MSI
[1:47:45] Laphx: @helpmepleeeeese yeah but that's the point, their aggressive playstyle gets punished so heavily against smarter/more macro korean teams
[1:47:45] Blacksun42: yandSad I am too tired for this shit
[1:47:51] Herrsch_: Guess we got OP Swain until then
[1:47:52] Sov25: LCK on 8.6
[1:47:57] Blacksun42: I am just gonna shut up
[1:48:00] Sov25: they can play kai sa
[1:48:09] sokoteur: that morg is sooo squishy
[1:48:11] twilek321: thresh4dayz i guess thats fine it just seems like watching who ever is best and thinking there going to win just isnt entertaining but if you like it good for you :)
[1:48:12] Herrsch_: No pick up yet right?
[1:48:14] 菁蛙: Actually Bang picked Kai'sa yesterday
[1:48:19] Herrsch_: ......
[1:48:22] mujarshad: lpl can also play kaisa on this patch
[1:48:24] Sov25: @Itsvoid_vg bang played it last night and had a huge highlight play
[1:48:24] Herrsch_: Ima be right back
[1:48:32] Herrsch_: So this game can wait
[1:48:43] Herrsch_: I'll return after watching that vod
[1:48:43] Sov25: It was game 1
[1:48:48] Sov25: against KSV
[1:48:54] Laphx: ???
[1:48:57] Herrsch_: Bless you twitch chat
[1:48:58] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: @iammeni no it's about CN throwing, not about KR finding mistakes and punishing.
[1:49:02] Hardlessdaimio: thats focus fire yes
[1:49:12] DanielSPoA: camille throwing
[1:49:13] EMP_Vince_McMahon: ICON POGGERS
[1:49:38] Laphx: @helpmepleeeeese that's a bit unfair to say, I would argue it's a bit of both
[1:49:41] Hardlessdaimio: that re engage of omg wasnt good
[1:49:42] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: yeah but the kaisa buffs arent until next patch
[1:49:45] Jakaa: China macro and mechanics besides IG
[1:49:49] Jakaa: omega fucking lul
[1:50:06] thresh4dayz: @helpmepleeeeese which CN - KR matchups are you talking about?
[1:50:09] kiwiininja123: This game knowledge is poor
[1:50:11] NahDawgDatAintMe: I like watching LPL because you can have an actual discussion in the chat
[1:50:29] rebeccamo: difference between throwing and mistake? LUL
[1:50:29] Laphx: don't worry, KT won't let SKT survive for 30 minutes in a game during their series
[1:50:32] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: @iammeni or you can say CN's mistakes are so easily punishable
[1:50:38] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: i like watching LPL because i want iBoy to love me

[1:51:58] Hardlessdaimio: did TL win yesterday?
[1:52:10] Laphx: yes
[1:52:12] mujarshad: yes
[1:52:14] Sov25: OMG so trash
[1:52:17] Chad_Libertarian: yes 3-1
[1:52:21] Sov25: Better import next time
[1:52:27] Laphx: 3-1, they beat down fox pretty easily
[1:52:32] Celoniadh: Olleh popped off on Kench
[1:52:44] Hardlessdaimio: They did an awsome job against C9 the week before so they are running
[1:52:47] Laphx: all of TL played really well tbh
[1:52:51] Sov25: Echo fox needs to drop bot and fenix
[1:52:55] Laphx: impact was great too
[1:53:00] thresh4dayz: Fenix carried TL harder than he did in season 5
[1:53:00] Sov25: then get a new import for mid or adc
[1:53:04] 83749394793: ez money
[1:53:10] EMP_Vince_McMahon: Olleh Kench and Xmithie Trundle POGGERS Adrian+Altec LUL Fenix OMEGALUL WutFace
[1:53:36] mujarshad: the number of times the shen comp in TL vs FOX was out global'd by a sion was a ridiculous...
[1:53:36] thresh4dayz: @Sov25 to be fair, fenix did play pretty well in the regular season. Though i agree, that playoff performance was atrocious
[1:53:37] Laphx: it really felt like huni and dardoch were tilted by the end lmao
[1:53:45] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: huni and dardick are great together, the rest just is not in sync
[1:53:48] Som2freak: DoritosChip
[1:53:56] happyface132: Doublelift made a promise to destroy TSM, and he did.
[1:53:59] Sov25: @thresh4dayz He got benched randomly, which would insinuate he brought internal issues to the team
[1:54:28] Hardlessdaimio: nice outfits
[1:54:37] keepootl: @Sov25 i think they need to get away from the chinese style coach does whole draft to a more hands off approach with player input
[1:54:40] PoliticalMuffin: @Sov25 They should capitalize on NA's vast pool of talent by picking up Keith and GoldenGlue
[1:54:49] NahDawgDatAintMe: Doublelift destroyed TSM by joining TL.
[1:54:52] Laphx: echo fox could even pick up keane if they really wanted to, i don't think it's really a down grade, and it opens up an import slot
[1:54:53] thresh4dayz: @PoliticalMuffin OMEGALUL
[1:55:05] Sov25: @PoliticalMuffin or get damonte and pick an adc import? doesn't sound hard
[1:55:10] EMP_Vince_McMahon: Huni and Dardoch going to give Fenix the 3D through a table POGGERS
[1:55:14] Hardlessdaimio: i miss dodo sin song :(
[1:55:16] mujarshad: LUL
[1:55:17] repetition: LUL
[1:55:19] thresh4dayz: @Sov25 that's pretty speculatory though, and they did bench him when they played papachao as well
[1:55:21] Celoniadh: to be fair to Huni, Shen was being out-globaled because TL was playing around him
[1:55:22] BarnaIdo: B L G
[1:55:23] NahDawgDatAintMe: No way Fly gives up Keane when they probably need him
[1:55:27] MdwdMw: Clement LUL

[1:55:53] aisasnidalee: LUL
[1:55:53] Laphx: @nahdawgdataintme yeah i agree but from efs side, it'd be a really nice move i think
[1:55:58] happyface132: Zven
[1:56:14] Sov25: @thresh4dayz Well they def didn't bench fenix because he played bad in reg season. he got benched for some reason and looking at his play now, well they were def on to something
[1:56:16] thresh4dayz: Im gonna be honest guys, was anyone really shocked by the NA playoff matches so far (Except TSM CG)
[1:56:23] Laphx: imagine if tsm kept DL/bio and picked up jankos instead
[1:56:28] Hardlessdaimio: @somadr3am 2K with knowledge are more worth LUL
[1:56:31] mujarshad: LUL
[1:56:34] EMP_Vince_McMahon: @happyface132 OUR GOAL IS WORLDS cannot even get out 1st round playoffs LUL
[1:56:48] MisakiKureha: @somadr3am you do know twitch is not the only platform where lpl is broadcasted *dimwit*
[1:56:50] Sov25: C9 couldve been more competitive with TL but not the worst upset
[1:56:52] superhumancini: @thresh4dayz no, c9 looked like shit leading up to playoffs
[1:56:56] Celoniadh: @thresh4dayz I'm a TL fan, so I was hardly shocked
[1:57:02] edgelordweeb: I assumed they benched Fenix because they felt they were locked for a bye and wanted to give Damonte time on stage
[1:57:17] 见钟情: Huni on tanks LUL
[1:57:18] Laphx: @edgelordweeb i'm inclined to agree with this
[1:57:31] thresh4dayz: @iammeni i dont think that would have worked out as well though. DL can take a lot of farm with POB in the mid lane (guy is known to be very strong with low eco)
[1:57:36] edgelordweeb: Not to mention the fact that Damonte is actually good
[1:57:59] happyface132: Damon Re is a beast
[1:57:59] Louieqd: @somadr3am also figure, twitch isnt the mamin esports platform in china
[1:58:15] EMP_Vince_McMahon: will damonte start for fox or will they just ship him off to GGS
[1:58:30] Laphx: @thresh4dayz that's really true, I remember when DL spoke about that earlier this split
[1:58:31] Sov25: Echo fox needs to look for a new coach and new adc/mid
[1:58:33] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: he's memeing guys relax
[1:58:38] Celoniadh: I'm really happy that Olleh and Doublift have figured out their synergy

[2:00:05] 櫻ゆき: give me forsen memes
[2:00:05] Sov25: @thegrompkiller what do you think of dardoch? guy was invading without pressure like a moron and baiting his team

[2:01:21] Celoniadh: yeah, I also think dardoch got tilted in game 4

[2:03:04] Laphx: @Sov25 @ga2006187329 Cody Sun even spoke about it in an interview, he was supposed to be on TL, TL was compromised of the old IMT team

[2:14:12] Chappey91: @Sov25 It took you 5 minutes too reply about EDG, when we are talking about IG. You need help kid.
[2:14:15] Hardlessdaimio: i bet TL just they are on the run
[2:14:15] RyRyRobe: TL won’t perform well at msi vs CN and KR
[2:14:25] thresh4dayz: @aqnguyen96 what do you define as 'doing well'? getting to semis or higher? or just playing good matches
[2:14:27] hardenfull: Let’s just hope we don’t get another TSM performance LUL

[2:26:42] Sov25: @thresh4dayz LCK system scrutinizes the importance of winning 2-0 so each game has huge consequences of losing

[2:26:57] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: tbh I think all lck teams are underperforming

[2:32:51] armaann: i doubt 100T plans to try and get Levi to work unless Ryu retires, more likely Levi gets on a new team when his english gets good enough

[2:37:14] Laphx: @thresh4dayz h2k and c9 were the only teams that got out of groups in 2016, both lost 0-3 to ssg, and if you want to argue that h2k made it to semis by beating anx... just lol
[2:37:14] iamxcellent: CN minions like NA players, they love to kill over objective
[2:37:15] mujarshad: LUL

[2:37:40] armaann: @RafeZ LUL
[2:37:41] RyRyRobe: TL at 18-9 in NA is not above a 33-7 in KR kingzone
[2:37:41] Laphx: @thresh4dayz G2 and TSM both under performed in both worlds the last 2 years, 2016 TSM had a hard group, 2017 G2 had a hard group, both failed both years
[2:37:46] Grimzzz: @pluristpurist because KR masterrace
[2:37:47] Sov25: @Chappey91 I watched all stars 2016(last time rookie was playing for international) and faker dumpster him. POB > Rookie and it's not even close

[2:38:28] Chappey91: @sov25 Ya in 2016 I predicted the top teams too. So just listen, thanks.
[2:38:28] Laphx: @RafeZ yeah but even then that's my point, NA and EU BOTH lost to anx and failed to get out of groups
[2:38:29] rafakiyoura: @armaann LUL ye like we losing to OCE trash also thinking NA is good enough to have 3 teams at worlds EleGiggle
[2:38:33] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: TSM > ALL LUL

[2:38:49] pluristpurist: @Grimzzz Agreed, all hail the KR overlords
[2:38:50] Taag69: @rafez nobody thought CLG was going to be good 2016, they basically took IMT's spot
[2:38:57] kapo51: TSM lost to a lower ranked team lol
[2:39:04] iamxcellent: @Chappey91 How do you have time to watch all regions?
[2:39:04] novanation2: cmonBruh
[2:39:08] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: Im looking forward to this year's RIFT RIVALS, imagine if EU lost again LUL
[2:39:10] hardenfull: LUL tsm best in the West
[2:39:11] RavenAuditore: when you put NA No.2 and its TL not 100T LUL
[2:39:14] rafakiyoura: @Taag69 still they made finals at MSI if that wasn't a strong NA team idk what would be
[2:39:31] Laphx: @thresh4dayz the only out standing difference is that in 2017 worlds MSF had a really nice performance against skt, but even then C9 played really well vs WE (i know it's not the same competition but it was still a good performance)
[2:39:31] blue0929: cmonBruh
[2:39:32] Grimzzz: @pluristpurist koreans have always been better at playing the map but chinese have very good tf

[2:39:51] iamxcellent: TSM is EU team with 3 european players and 2 NA players
[2:39:53] Elonado: @VisLaud_RlyTho worlds is the only tourney with real big money, alltough MSI got upgraded this year, but keep on thinking that allstar tourneys or rift rivals show anything
[2:39:54] thresh4dayz: @helpmepleeeeese honestly, i dont put much stock in either rift rivals
[2:39:55] Chappey91: I watch all regions and its iG > TL > KZ > AF > 100T > Fnatic > G-Rex
[2:40:03] superhumancini: these Ornn ults have been pretty bad all game
[2:40:13] hardenfull: Lol typically it’s like this all asians > Everyone else
[2:40:15] Laphx: @thresh4dayz splyce wasn't competitive at worlds, i don't know what you mean, and I'm talking about in the last 2 years, OG and FNC semis was 3 worlds ago
[2:40:26] iamxcellent: TL and 100T?
[2:40:28] Taag69: @rafez they looked a lot worse 5 months later
[2:40:31] iamxcellent: 2 NA team?
[2:40:51] hardenfull: TL all asians... NA btw
[2:40:52] Chappey91: NA has improved greatly with the addition of the koreans
[2:40:55] pluristpurist: @Grimzzz yea this is my 1st time watching the lpl this year, this is hysterical lol
[2:40:57] thresh4dayz: @iammeni that's actually a fair point about C9. they did do quite well.
[2:41:04] biohacker__: this teamfight was really fkin entertaining
[2:41:08] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: aqnguyen96 yeah we have all races in NA
[2:41:15] rafakiyoura: EleGiggle NA ONLY RELEVANT CAUSE THEY HAVE EU AND KR PLAYERS EleGiggle STAY MAD AND BAD NA EleGiggle
[2:41:17] Laphx: @thresh4dayz if you want to include MSI, we can even include that CLG made it to finals in 2016 and G2 in 2017, while both opposites (G2 2016, and TSM 2017) failed miserably
[2:41:24] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: @iammeni TBH WE was the only team that took one game off SSG, which LZ AND SKT didn't
[2:41:47] Laphx: @thresh4dayz I would give a slight edge to EU overall performance wise, but I don't think that puts them in completely different conversations
[2:41:51] armaann: being white is so outdated bro keep up on the new fashion
[2:41:54] hardenfull: Rip ssg 2018
[2:41:56] rafakiyoura: @helpmepleeeeese still they lost to TSM and almost lost to C9 in quarters

[2:43:48] Chappey91: I watch all regions and its iG > TL > KZ > AF > 100T > Fnatic > G-Rex. I'm an 8 year veteran. Trust me.
[2:43:53] LIQUID_LOST_TO_EVS: @RafeZ yeah so you can say C9 was decent last year
[2:43:54] Jakaa: 16 kills 1 turret LUL Legit 0 clue on how to play the game
[2:44:00] Laphx: @thresh4dayz mm it's been a while, but CLG out performed G2 in their group, TSM out performed splyce in their group, C9 and H2K both got out, and had the same results vs SSG, although h2k performed better imo, jankos was great in that series

[3:29:12] Endaldren_: why is there such delay between matches?
[3:29:56] PreacherCasts: @BLakeSaaR The matches are in different cities (look below the vs) and as such, the physical audience buy tickets. You can't start a match before the ticketted time or else the audience won't have arrived :)
[3:29:59] edgelordweeb: @blakesaar between these probably because it’s scheduled and they’re at different venues

[7:20:02] xStorm111: @frox3 in my opinion the only lane better in late game is cait. zoe falls down really hard in late game, the champion kinda sucks if she doesn't poke correctly before the teamfight and they have enough shields to deny the poke
