[0:39:55] AnotherKyle: whats wrong with dl
[0:39:58] ignisami: @plasticbeg if he's the type to grieve by throwing himself into work, yes. otherwise, doubtful

[0:42:18] ignisami: then there's the service, which needs catering and invitations for friends/extended family
[0:42:25] AnotherKyle: yeah but he needs to practice for sunday, so that'll effect him. not lookin good. but its his job if u think of it, so.. he might take time off this week from practice, but he doesnt really need it. so hopefully he can play and he'll be ok to. if not, hes gotta do what he has to do.
[0:42:29] ignisami: can easily take a week. Took two when I had to do it
[0:43:06] ignisami: @therealADDICT some people grieve by taking time off. Others do so by throwing themselves in work. If he's the latter he'll play. If he's the former he won't. simple as that

[0:44:21] deadlydaddio: I made affiliate today, congratulate me!
[0:44:23] AnotherKyle: @ignisami true, taking time off makes complete sense. but 2nd place and 1st place get a significant prize for winning. and being champs. so, if he wants to take a break after, makes sense. but not before the finals. imo.

[1:24:00] SacrificedToRNGesus: @scottofl2014 would make more sense to start him, since Score will likely be the guy they want vs KZ, and the less KZ knows, the better
[1:24:05] CertainlySomeoneHere: And that not only in top picks, I think he's one of the better champions in normal play too
[1:24:07] smolpotatofren: jiggly puff is best gril
[1:24:11] JavierEstrada99: Dude, I honestly want to see a iG vs KZ at the MSI. Holy Match it could be BlessRNG
