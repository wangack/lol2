[5:32:03] 187juggernaut: DL will either win worlds, or never recover from this, he'd moved apart from his parents, grown up and forged his own life, h was only just getting back to talking to his parents, i dont think it will hurt him as much as people think, it sucks, but he'd already gorwn up without them
