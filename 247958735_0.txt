[1:27:56] sweboy123: @RBQuark oter guy said it is china, ?? :/
[1:27:58] QuarkStorm: Because Master Yi gets denied so easily in pro play
[1:28:05] Cindella: it might have been 8 pointed

[3:49:59] skot_lol: @certainlysomeonehere how am i shitting on me. i am just saying that condi is far better player than him and that WE is completely differnet without Condi's early game. in addition, Magic has a questionalbr champ pool and obvious weaker pressure. If you saw RNg without uzi its the same situation. if we is losing to teams like omg then something is not right.

[4:42:03] KaaOz1987: its wired that top teams not rank 1 ? that is good IMO ! XD
[4:42:05] NAEqualizer: There will be no SKT, GAM, TSM and maybe even G2 at MSI
[4:42:08] refereetodd: @rustythecaster well the items they keep bringing in and then removing others. The rework of champs. I just feel like every patch has huge changes.
[4:42:18] ChocoboLord: let's hope to see Origen next year in eulcs
[4:42:30] shikarie02: will they have a chance with franchising in place?
[4:42:37] refereetodd: @rustythecaster I guess weird isn't the right word
[4:42:50] KaaOz1987: who wanna she the same time again and again every times at worlds doing the same thing, and see skt t1 win every year that sounds boring XD
[4:42:55] KaaOz1987: *team
[4:42:58] ChocoboLord: @shikarie02 they play in eu masters and they have froggen/expect/insec... i guess that will bring many fans
[4:42:58] LaoWai42: @leaguephony i believe you mean hype
[4:43:29] RustyTheCaster: It's been a big year for change, only the most adaptable teams should be able to succeed right
[4:43:33] shikarie02: @ChocoboLord yeah but the money needed to enter the main league and other nonsense. i hope they make it too but it will be hard
[4:43:34] ChocoboLord: @shikarie02 they bring a ton of fans with them that's why i think they will be in

[4:45:32] no1malzahar: bang
[4:45:47] NAEqualizer: Too many roster changes this year too, i just hope SKT can make a decent roster with a better jungler for the Summer, Blank hurts on the eye, better playing with no jungler than one who can't clear his own Krugs, im a huge fan early 2014 and it feels really bad to see them like that
[4:45:52] mujarshad: that trist play was so silly 4Head
[4:45:57] RustyTheCaster: SKT will be good in Summer
[4:46:05] shikarie02: ...SKT makes me sad, let's not talk about them
[4:46:06] reyn7777: i think KZDX will win MSI
[4:46:12] ChocoboLord: @RUSTYTheCASTER Echo Fox would be in finals if all those changes weren't to happen and that's cool
[4:46:32] RustyTheCaster: yeah instead Liquid booty blasted them
[4:46:38] refereetodd: @rustythecaster yeah kz/ig has been insane to watch the dominance of both. I just wish the LPL streamed on twitch for all games

[5:35:08] NAEqualizer: EU didnt look like trash last MSI because WE wasnt that good, they didnt show anything like IG is showing right now
[5:35:11] mujarshad: so they are using duke
[5:35:15] doctor9h: TL are more near the same lvl to KZ and IG than KZ and IG are to the level of FNC. FNC are the best team in the World atm and BY FAR. They are as strong as Samsung white S4 or SKT S5. You will see
[5:35:15] Laphx: oh that's sad
[5:35:19] RustyTheCaster: He's taking time off for an 'injury'
[5:35:20] Laphx: duke... yikes
[5:35:22] mujarshad: but i don't think the injury is that serious
[5:35:26] RustyTheCaster: I'm sure he'll be here for playoffs just like uzi for rng
[5:35:36] Laphx: thanks
[5:35:42] shikarie02: LUL i like FNC but props to the guy hyping them up so much in this chat
