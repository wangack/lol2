[0:36:24] Casen_Point: Didn't he punch his ex?

[0:36:26] raikonduo: 10 fps omg
[0:36:43] Art1ficer_: it's assault
[0:36:45] DolphinPriest: on stream
[0:36:47] ZennShade: He didn't beat her that we know of. He just knocked some stuff over.
[0:36:51] weebonduty: Clearlove BibleThump
[0:36:53] WhoKnowsUA: @ZennShade it wasn't just his personal life, he performed that abuse during his stream. Maybe if it was offstream Riot won't care at all idk
[0:36:54] ZennShade: Don't be dramatic.
[0:37:07] DolphinPriest: free vasili BibleThump
[0:37:13] Art1ficer_: did you follow the story? there was strong evidence he beat her
[0:37:26] Art1ficer_: and there was more than that. he'd already gotten in trouble for chasing around officials
[0:37:31] Casen_Point: I mean, it could be worse
[0:37:33] Art1ficer_: and throwing monitors and stuff
[0:37:48] Casen_Point: Could have been NFL level of bull adn letting the worst kind of people keep playing
[0:37:48] mujarshad: @Clunk_Smash i mean, the gf denied it
[0:37:55] ZennShade: Sounds like he went apeshit. Didn't know it was that bad. But only banning him until 2019 seems weird in that case.
[0:37:59] WhoKnowsUA: ther wasn't evidience, and she said he didn't beat her
[0:38:11] Art1ficer_: a domestic abuse victim denying it? wow never heard of that before
[0:38:20] NoSopaForYou: Vasilii was good boy. He would never hurt a fly. He'll only hurt a keyboard and table DansGaem
[0:38:26] ZennShade: I mean, Jensen got banned and that shit was indefinite
[0:38:47] weebonduty: stop killing loli BibleThump
[0:39:01] Art1ficer_: look, domestic abuse is a complicated subject. and there are many reasons why the victim may deny it despite their best interests
[0:39:03] mujarshad: LUL
[0:39:06] ZennShade: And all he did was be toxic af and drop hack opponents.
[0:39:08] WhoKnowsUA: @ZennShade wow what evidience u've seen lol? some stuff dropping away from camera, that evidience? bcs u can't clearly see him beating his GF on video.
[0:39:10] Casen_Point: rekt
[0:39:14] NoSopaForYou: for what jensen did, he got lucky they unbanned him
[0:39:20] Art1ficer_: if you are going to argue that since the chinese government didn't charge him, then riot shouldn't, i could kinda see wht you mean
[0:39:24] WhoKnowsUA: @ZennShade sorry wrong pm xD
[0:39:31] teumessianfoxes: HAHAHA
[0:39:32] AI_Logic: what did jensen do?
[0:39:34] Art1ficer_: but its one instance i support riot in their banning

[0:39:44] Art1ficer_: rather than Jensen/IWD/Forg1ven lol
[0:39:44] WhoKnowsUA: @Clunk_Smash wow what evidience u've seen lol? some stuff dropping away from camera, that evidience? bcs u can't clearly see him beating his GF on video.
[0:39:52] Sov25: @Clunk_Smash LUL insinuating that chinese govt would give justice
[0:39:55] ZennShade: I think beating your gf even allegedly or whatever is wrong.
[0:40:04] goblinguy01: Vasilli just misclicked Kappa
[0:40:08] pokerigo: DoritosChip DoritosChip
[0:40:10] ZennShade: But I feel like that's a government issues and should have no bearing on league.
[0:40:15] Art1ficer_: nvm no one in chat understands it's a complex issue i cbf arguing
[0:40:28] ZennShade: Of course it's complex, bud.
[0:40:38] Art1ficer_: i'm just glad it's not like NFL where the players get away with assault and keep playing
[0:40:40] goblinguy01: Did the Chinese official arrest him?
[0:40:46] AI_Logic: noone arguing, just having conversation LUL
[0:40:50] Art1ficer_: he was arrested but not charged
[0:40:53] saltran: IG PogChamp
[0:40:56] mujarshad: @Clunk_Smash and? if the authorities are not willing to press charges due to no corroboration by the gf and lack of evidence why should riot ban players?
[0:40:57] tityboiflora: lmao
[0:40:57] twilek321: why people talking about this ...
[0:40:58] NateInPerson: I'm gonna guess that it's less that Jensen got lucky and more that he exhibited signs of personal growth since he was a kid at the time.
[0:41:00] goblinguy01: Did China tell Tencent? How did they find out in the US?
[0:41:15] tityboiflora: PogChamp
[0:41:18] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: being threatening and intimidating to your girlfriend on stream is pretty fucked up even if you didnt beat her, Riot is 100% in the right to ban him

[0:41:25] WhoKnowsUA: @Clunk_Smash u said about evidience, when in reality there is no proof of that. You have only sound and GF denying that he beat her. I'm not saying he didn't deserved his ban tho
[0:41:30] weebonduty: angel voice BibleThump
[0:41:30] Art1ficer_: @mujarshad I said that's a fair argument to make. but imo there was very strong evidence he did it.
[0:41:31] ZennShade: And I also find it funny that Jensen gets banned indefinitely for being toxic.
[0:41:37] saltran: <3
[0:41:49] AI_Logic: who is shotcaller for ig?
[0:41:52] ZennShade: But Vasilli evidently beat his gf and it's a measly year ban? lol
[0:41:52] Art1ficer_: but if the gf isn't willing to say that he did, then I agree it's hard for riot to act, but I still personally agree with their desicion
[0:42:06] goblinguy01: @ai_logic I believe Rookie or Ning?
[0:42:12] DolphinPriest: lets talk about cats VoHiYo
[0:42:26] Casen_Point: I have three and I love them all
[0:42:27] Art1ficer_: well riot wanted to set a precedent about toxicity, and were very stupid and naive to make it permanent
[0:42:27] Sov25: @ZennShade riot for western side actually have little tolerance. LPL just flaunt cash and have connections you gucci
[0:42:29] WhoKnowsUA: @ZennShade he wasn't just toxic, he ddosed ppl and Riot had proof of that, DDOSing is crime in alot of countires and you can go in jail bcs of that tho

[0:53:55] goblinguy01: If you want to beat Korea
[0:54:03] Art1ficer_: Namei not Uzi*
[0:54:07] ZennShade: SKT probably won't even go to Worlds this year, so it's moot lol

[0:54:36] antster32: DoritosChip
[0:54:39] goblinguy01: Maybe Condi
[0:54:44] camelwink: @J2easoN probably loken

[0:54:58] J2easoN: ok hope so too :) @Camelwink
[0:55:12] Art1ficer_: SKT came 4th in regular split and playoffs
[0:55:14] goblinguy01: I said LPL team not full Chinese ^^
[0:55:18] camelwink: @J2easoN :)
[0:55:29] 噢噢三: why will they get 1 win before the game starts?
[0:55:36] Art1ficer_: Griffin are coming up from relegations tho, and KT are still way better atm tho
[0:55:40] Sangomah: seeding
[0:55:46] tatsu824: because of their regular season's seed
[0:55:51] goblinguy01: Royal Club has the best chance at worlds, World Elite did so badly this year
[0:55:58] 噢噢三: i see
[0:56:05] BarnaIdo: 🤔
[0:56:07] Art1ficer_: IG has the best chance...

[0:56:25] Art1ficer_: the 1 match headstart is to prevent sandbagging
[0:56:28] goblinguy01: IG can tilt. RNG beat Samsung easy 2-0
[0:56:29] 歐歐八迪: #WEWIN
[0:56:36] Art1ficer_: yeah but KT are better than ever
[0:56:43] QuestCape: what is jingdong gamings roster? all no names?

[0:56:53] tatsu824: iG as a team is still very young and inexperience but i'll be stay positive towards them

[0:57:04] LaoWai42: @QuestCape yes a bunch of young guns
[0:57:06] 面长宽碗大圆: Where is DODOSIN
[0:57:07] Art1ficer_: in S4 they had the hardest oppositon and Faker was still the best performing player in the world
[0:57:08] goblinguy01: IG should win LPL
[0:57:12] Vladutz19: Ding Dong Gaming, by Gunther.
[0:57:12] 歐歐八迪: AmazingJJ noob

[0:57:47] Art1ficer_: well Dade was beast mode Spring actually, then Mata and Dandy at worlds but Faker wasn't there so who knows
[0:57:55] NateInPerson: Like how Afreeca has ascended from SKT kryptonite to finals contender.
[0:57:56] goblinguy01: SKT lost to Jin Air, BBQ, MVP...talk about tilt
[0:57:59] Celestialbeeing: starts in 30mins right? Kappa
[0:58:03] leapinc66: lpl sure has a lot of room to grow. There are so many talented people in China. But somehow the system wont let these talented people live to the fullest
[0:58:13] Casen_Point: I do wonder if there's gonna be Korean Shuffle coming Summer
[0:58:15] scottoflorida2014: Best player in LCK or LPL has to be that NA import RUSH! ;)
[0:58:24] tatsu824: im not gonna deny their talent but in terms of global competition I think they still need more experience
[0:58:28] Art1ficer_: it's almost like Marin is overrated 🤔 and requires his entire team to play around him 🤔 and AF are doing better with Kiin 🤔
[0:58:35] goblinguy01: LongZhu 3-0
[0:58:35] fizz_on_me_jayce: @leapinc66 these 2 teams have pretty good new talent

[0:59:35] esbomgaroto: 👊🏻
[0:59:35] Art1ficer_: @leapinc66 well LPL screwed themselves for several years thinking they could win by just buying Koreans, despite having amazing homegrown talent at their disposal
[0:59:37] Tristano7: TheThing
[0:59:39] Casen_Point: AmazingJ POGGERS

[1:00:54] Art1ficer_: @meeegz it's only for round 1, not round 2 or 3
[1:01:01] shikarie02: why lol, it’s their reward for placing high during a very long split
[1:01:03] Art1ficer_: to prevent sandbagging to avoid certain teams
[1:01:05] 0k_BRAH: i want a tournament without lck teams
[1:01:15] chhopsky: i cant believe JDG made it to playoffs
[1:01:17] shikarie02: lck just sends you straight to the finals for finishing first
[1:01:17] Casen_Point: That's not how that works

[1:01:27] chou701: HotPokket
[1:01:28] NahDawgDatAintMe: 8 teams make playoffs right?
[1:01:31] leapinc66: @Clunk_Smash china still has a lot internal issue that hinders the people. If the system is properly functioned, you will witness so many players even better than faker.

[1:08:21] PandanPaisen: LOL
[1:08:26] Art1ficer_: but as someone that's watched every major esport ever, Faker is maybe the greatest anomoly ever. not the greatest esport plaeyr (that's Flash), but just the level he is above others in his game...
[1:08:26] shikarie02: lol
[1:08:27] 0k_BRAH: tl might be able to get to quarter finals this year i hope

[1:39:02] zetaxxxx: 上中下野都要發育結果前期狂接團 笑死
[1:39:02] im_moyo: it just means you're not the best in the world

[1:39:11] Art1ficer_: @im_moyo I watch LCK tho so that's usually how I judge you, top tier in LCK = good
[1:39:17] scottoflorida2014: Faker would be 5th best midlaner if in NA
[1:39:22] Celestialbeeing: clid pulling the trigger Kappa

[1:40:05] im_moyo: he would do fine vs the rest

[1:40:11] scottoflorida2014: Rush came from NA and had a perfect game in LCK in his second game against AFS :)
[1:40:14] NateInPerson: Impact wants you to beat him. That's how he wins.
[1:40:21] Art1ficer_: he's still a really good player, but he'd only get picked by a lower tier LCK team at this point
[1:40:27] TeRueL9: CASTERS ARE BIASED AF

[1:40:41] mujarshad: @TeRueL9 ???
[1:40:43] Losecian: tbh rush got hard carried in that afs game
[1:40:45] Rebound_Dig: nobody would "roll" impact. Maybe 10-15 cs lead sure but you cant just destroy impact
[1:40:47] scottoflorida2014: @iLLiminate45 TSM?

[1:41:04] Art1ficer_: huni is best top na easily though

[1:41:09] scottoflorida2014: @bolsterland No pro player loses on purpose, they are too competitive

[1:43:35] im_moyo: i mean SKT definitely has the money lol
[1:43:38] Art1ficer_: @HumanMarkZuckerberg ehh, it was more Blizzard that ruined Brood War actually. they forced OGN and stuff to move to SC2
[1:43:41] FK_P: peanut is overrated
[1:43:42] im_moyo: they just think they dont have to spend that much
[1:43:46] scottoflorida2014: SKT has more than enough money
[1:43:48] datboymtron: liquid had to pay a ton to get impact so safe to assume he had some other serious offers
[1:43:52] shikarie02: SKT have money, they're just not paying ridiculous amounts for people who they don't rate as much as Faker and Bang
[1:43:56] im_moyo: ^
[1:43:59] Art1ficer_: @HumanMarkZuckerberg that's the reason there was match fixing, players realising their time was up and they needed some money before the scene died

[1:44:27] Art1ficer_: there are many reasons tho with Brood War, part of it was a natural death @HumanMarkZuckerberg like what happened with Quake
[1:44:27] im_moyo: yes
[1:44:29] scottoflorida2014: Will EU be able to keep players when they get franchising or will they continue to lose players who want to make real money

[1:44:51] im_moyo: Bang was amazing this split

[1:44:59] ZennShade: Bang has never been the best ad in his own region, so.
[1:45:00] Art1ficer_: @HumanMarkZuckerberg the match fixing did speed up its death in the end, so ur partly right. but yeah, the best esport Brood War, and the second best Quake just kinda died in popularity to other things...sad really
[1:45:03] ManiaaQQ: Wow he make a triple kill so now he's god LUL

[1:53:28] dev1v9: @dudemanmcbroguy DL is garbage LUL how many times did he make it out of grozps? LUL
[1:53:30] ZennShade: Xmithie is a good strategic jungler, but mechanically speaking he's dogshit.

[1:54:20] NateInPerson: But Xmithie prevents his team from tilting while historically Dardoch becomes the force that makes his team tilt.

[1:56:17] dev1v9: This year's TL is a weaker version of last years' TSM. Basically, they're last years' TSM with a worse top and a supp who doesn't synergise with Double
