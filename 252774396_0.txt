[0:06:52] 蓮緒柊初: ＃rngwin
[0:06:56] velocegravity: theyve nothing to do with each other. Faker is a midlaner, Rookie is a midlaner. Why insulting Rookie by calling him mini faker?
[0:07:02] sushi0_0: @RUSTYTheCASTER notic me senpie
[0:07:06] leon99671: idk maybe ask frosk? LUL
[0:07:09] sakura_chain: is this the finals

[0:07:23] bluestorm1998: Do you guys really think that without TheShy their chances of advancing has decreased?
[0:07:25] camelwink: @sakura_chain semiss
[0:07:26] 사나없이사나마나: rng에 우지 있냐 ?
[0:07:29] easyhoonisbest: Rookie is as expriences as faker believe me , not really mini.

[0:08:10] no2Astro: LCK is tomorrow
[0:08:15] no2Astro: MVP vs KDM
[0:08:19] camelwink: @bitconneccccccccccct its hard to say who is "better" bc you have to ask in which parts he's better. imo uzi is a stronger laner but jackeylove has such good mechanics to really more often pull out really good clutch moments
[0:08:19] goblinguy01: Isn't Duke bad?
[0:08:20] Pawneee: tobias1 tobias2 tobiasOK
[0:08:26] easyhoonisbest: duke will suffer its unlucky for IG
[0:08:27] shikarie02: pray for Duke BlessRNG

[0:09:23] camelwink: ^^^^^
[0:09:24] alonsomafioso: Is TheShy playing ?
[0:09:32] easyhoonisbest: NING will decide the fate of IG
[0:09:36] easyhoonisbest: believe me
[0:09:39] Karoushi: Karsa played in the LMS, in League context, he's from a different region
[0:09:40] goblinguy01: How come AmazingJ, and Tabe can play on the LPL team without imports?
[0:09:59] sushi0_0: @RUSTYTheCASTER you think uzi can win a playoff
[0:10:02] shikarie02: did u guys watch Rookie’s interview with Pulse? he’s so fluent it’s scary
[0:10:03] i_am_zevron: IS IT QUATER OR SEMI ??

[0:10:50] goblinguy01: No imports for AJ
[0:10:58] goblinguy01: Or Tabe for IG
[0:11:11] RustyTheCaster: BLG have Chieftain and Road
[0:11:11] goblinguy01: AJ doesn't count as an import xD
[0:11:14] sushi0_0: is IG from china for korea?
[0:11:15] shikarie02: @vislaud_rlytho the unluckiest thing would be both TheShy and Duke injured at the same time bruh. one is still ok LUL
[0:11:19] Karoushi: If they declared the LPL as their residence, when they started their career, they are LPL players
[0:11:30] kcck0531: IG without the shy Kappa

[0:13:10] DterrorA: Duke got carried
[0:13:19] goblinguy01: Tabe and Amazing J can play in the LPL while being from a region that is connected to the LMS
[0:13:22] k4ynt: isn't LPL f*cked because of their schedule ? they go directly to MSI afterwards ?
