[6:22:29] SomberIain: who came up with this strat chat ?
[6:22:31] Sannysanny98: Why morde "support"? 1. Morde has no mana, so he has good waveclear mid and jungle. 2. Morde's W gives extra exp for him when minions die near that, so he'll be okay exp-wise. 3. Morde W heals at the end, so it gives fairly okay sustain in the jungle and mid lane. 4. Morde and graves will need to have drake controll so the morde drake can help their team to split.
