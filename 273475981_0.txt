[0:24:43] stopFlirtingWithMe: LUL taking this meta seriously
[0:25:31] camelwink: @sofa_king_sticky idk but it makes sorta sense for like a "refresh" its just that maybe they could start athena and m1anhua sometimes and then use that throughout the entire series if they really intended to use them on their team oof
[0:25:45] sofa_king_sticky: @Camelwink agreed, but I think the real problem for them in this meta is bot lane can't draw pressure away from AJ anymore, with all these roaming champs. And with no other win condition he'll just get dogpiled in the top lane, like he did in game 1 early

[2:57:05] yodahk720: no one watches LPL unless RNG is playing lmao
[2:57:15] Ryboiii: LPL legit just won msi what do you mean lmao
[2:57:29] kittenski: froskurin is a boy
[2:57:39] flaava: strongest region - lose with 10k gold lead
[2:57:45] cosmicdeliverer: is LPL playing while LCK is playing?
[2:57:57] yodahk720: LPL is 2nd strongest after LCK
[2:58:01] itsLaamps: Frosk Kreygasm
[2:58:13] yodahk720: RNG is best team right now. SKT, KZ very mediocre right now
[2:58:19] charlie1o5: @yodahk720 think you'll find lpl won msi, so technically
[2:58:21] Ryboiii: Only the bottom half of lck is really that weak
[2:58:24] WhiskeyFixx: great kennen ult
[2:58:26] TheQueenOfPatatas: actually the arguably second best LPL team CRUSHED the BY FAR best LCK team at MSI so id say LPL is currently prolly the best region
[2:58:27] cosmicdeliverer: @VisLaud_RlyTho wait for worlds
[2:58:33] Ryboiii: I think the top 4 of LCK are respectable
[2:58:58] charlie1o5: But, we all know, NA is just the God region Kappa
[2:59:01] yodahk720: @charlie1o5 just because one team in a region won doesnt make that region the best. i sitll think most teams in LCK will beat most teams in LPL
[2:59:14] itsLaamps: Pls step on me Frosk Kreygasm
[2:59:21] TheQueenOfPatatas: yodashk720 actually the arguably second best LPL team CRUSHED the BY FAR best LCK team at MSI so id say LPL is currently prolly the best region
[2:59:36] cosmicdeliverer: LPL will stomp LCK? thats why 45k viewer difference is on the streams xD
[3:00:11] yodahk720: but they still won and they won MSI
[3:00:16] MisakiKureha: @CosmicDeliverer Lpl usually had 600-1000 veiwers still beat lck so see no sense in that statement
[3:00:18] TheQueenOfPatatas: yea idk how you can currently make an argument for the LPL not beeing the best region
[3:00:22] OMNlSCI3NCE: @cosmicdeliverer I think more Koreans watch than Chinese that's why the viewer difference is so great
[3:00:31] Pillsbury_Doughboy: hIIInder
[3:00:31] trisssmerigold: if youre talking about region, LPL won rift rivals
[3:00:35] charlie1o5: That is like saying just because samsung gal won worlds...doesn't make them the world champs i.e, the best in the world
[3:00:46] TheQueenOfPatatas: guys those are just the WESTERN viewers NotLikeThis the actual chinese stream has way more viewers than even NALCS
[3:00:49] matlish: Yeah china won MSI that doesnt nullify the fact that korea have won the past FIVE worlds
[3:00:55] sevenyam: chinese don't use twitch and most koreans use tv
[3:00:58] sqradi: to be fair RNG had Able/Y4 subbed in for half those games, and Able was just a rookie.
[3:00:59] yodahk720: who's the best team in the LPL right now?
[3:01:20] matlish: yeah no LPL is just such a shit timezone for western viewers
[3:01:23] TheQueenOfPatatas: matlish yes it kinda does it means that the LPL is better now. winning in the past doesnt make you good now
[3:01:26] Pillsbury_Doughboy: @yodahk720 I am
[3:02:23] TheQueenOfPatatas: THIS stream is only for WESTERN viewers one TWITCH. teh actual CHINESE fans wantch the LPL on different platforms and there are way more viewers than EULCS and NALCS have combined
[3:02:26] matlish: MSI is not worlds (where there are more teams and more games).
[3:02:28] OMNlSCI3NCE: I feel that the current meta is terrible for LCK and is the opposite of their normal play style where it benefits the LPL and how they play the game
[3:02:53] ps22447936: team afro is best team in the world
[3:03:04] matlish: im not saying LPL is worse than LCK, but worlds will be the real proving grounds
[3:03:16] matlish: sound WutFace
[3:03:17] TahlaM: wat song is this
[3:03:32] matlish: its a pentakill one cant remember which one
[3:03:32] Pillsbury_Doughboy: sounds like amouranth
[3:03:37] sqradi: Yes, Worlds looking the most interesting this year with no 1 team looking like the dominating team FeelsGoodMan
[3:04:06] Pillsbury_Doughboy: Amaranthe*
[3:04:07] matlish: @Siraxta_ its tear of the goddess
[3:04:14] TahlaM: thx buddy
[3:04:19] TheQueenOfPatatas: matlish ofc u can never say what region is the best but you can make way more of an argument for the LPL atm. even if the LCK ends up winning worlds it wouldnt mean that the LPL wasnt better right now you feel me?
[3:04:48] 예쁜민채: h
[3:04:55] mooonqc: LPL as a region has really matured. Really hoping they contest worlds this year
[3:05:24] TheQueenOfPatatas: LPL is the by far biggest region with th emost money only a matter of time until they are the undisputed top dog imo
[3:05:35] matlish: For sure you can make an argument for LPL, honestly im with you in thinking they are stronger. But honestly one tournament with one team per region cant define region strength
[3:05:40] flaava: t h r o w
[3:05:44] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: longshot, but I was impressed by the Vietnam region at msi.
[3:06:01] matlish: gota disagree vietnam were pretty bad
[3:06:08] OMNlSCI3NCE: Also certain teams can beat other teams for example in the past Flash Wolves was the the SKT killer so say SKT faced them first and lost, they could still be the best team in worlds because they could have beaten everyone else but Flash Wolves
[3:06:18] matlish: ronOP was hilariously bad
[3:06:27] sqradi: Vietnam would probably thrive in this current bloodbath fiesta meta LUL
[3:06:28] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: their early game bloodbath style is meta atm.
[3:06:46] matlish: in the games they win they snowball super hard because of how they play
[3:06:58] MariaIsabel_: If Worlds happen in This meta, lpl teams would definetily win. They are used to troll picks
[3:07:01] TheQueenOfPatatas: matlish i mean if u look at that tournament in particular i think it does say alot if you consider that the first place LCK team was head and shoulders ahead of every other korean team and the LPL team wasnt even considered the best team in the region by many but still LCK got smashed pretty hard
[3:07:06] matlish: but other regions are better strategically, even in an early game meta
[3:07:51] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: lck is in Flux right now. lpl is stable. curious if other regions step up.
[3:08:20] matlish: Fair point we do have to think about relative strength. I can accept that at least at mid season LPL are looking stronger, but worlds will still be the decider for me.
[3:08:50] o0AC0o: HeyGuys
[3:08:52] sqradi: LPL teams born & raised in these early game bloodbath fiestas but they've also recently gotten better in macro management, things are looking good for LPL
[3:09:13] TheQueenOfPatatas: matlish yea i agree i think the LPL is stronger for now but by no means does that mean that they will win worlds in a few months
[3:09:15] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: lpl might be the only region where the same teams from spring are still on top.
[3:09:35] matlish: actual mature discussion in twitch chat POGGERS
[3:09:36] iyedol72: Not true
[3:09:37] AraGakk1Yui: 1.3k BibleThump
[3:09:46] iyedol72: LMS
[3:09:53] ArmadsTheDoomBringer: the question is whether other regions adapt or not.
[3:10:00] 居踢歐: 🤔
[3:10:16] TheQueenOfPatatas: random question does anyone know the name of that handy site that shows you how often champs got picked/banend in competitive?
[3:10:22] OMNlSCI3NCE: I feel that worlds at the moment has no clear winner, I feel that any region can win now there is a way higher chance of the LCK and LPL winning but I feel in terms this year it's the most up in the air
[3:10:30] Dzrocker: We have even seen the other regions..
[3:10:40] Dzrocker: havent

[6:37:10] nek0gaming: ADC LUL

[6:38:08] TwitchyJoe: @mujarshad ADCs havent been OP since season 2. The mobility creep combined with %maxhp dmg from every new champ slowly killed them out. You would need almost perfect mechanics to do well as adc, and hard carrying as AD was almost impossible for a long time, (With exception of Kaisa, Ezreal)
[6:38:22] Un1eashedChaos: banned 4Head
[6:38:25] vanKaaskop: Problem with supports is that theydo to much with little gold
[6:38:26] danny_mg: @TwitchyJoe adcs were op in season 3

[6:39:35] Gus1207: 0:13 am ResidentSleeper
[6:39:40] vanKaaskop: before support would have 50% of the adcs gold gain and now they are closer to 80% while doing next to nothing
