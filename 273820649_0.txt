[0:27:45] mujarshad: that draft by fnc was so disrespectful if msf 4Head
[0:27:58] mujarshad: of msf*
[0:29:04] JrLovegroup: @Bugattiz644 i remember them winning in 2017 spring split and summer split vs SN gaming if i remember
[0:29:18] JrLovegroup: but i guess i could be wrong
[0:29:22] mini_high: SKT 0-2 thats a damn shame
[0:31:06] ZCanuck: @AfroKaptain they need to bring Rapidstar and cCarter back, guess they were the genius behing skt and not Kkoma
[0:31:10] JrLovegroup: yeah not sure what happen with SKT but dosen't look like the SKT of old times
[0:31:41] ZCanuck: i mean looking at champ win rates on 8.11 Ez 43%, GP 36%, Shen 21% Kennen 0 for 8...these all champs SKT have selected for some reason
[0:31:57] ZCanuck: they blue side ban taliyah, thats terrible
[0:32:08] JrLovegroup: i think they're just testing some comps i guess
[0:32:11] Killerjayss: is kayle good right now?
[0:32:22] Killerjayss: why is she now all of a sudden viable in the ad carry role
[0:32:37] me1n3: what are u talking about LUL its not about the champs have u even seen them play their macro ? that was sickening to watch
[0:32:38] JrLovegroup: Kayle always been a beast!
[0:32:51] Bugattiz644: igv disqualified BibleThump
[0:33:10] Killerjayss: don't get me wrong, I love that champs like kayle, and mundo, and aatrox are viable now
[0:33:27] JrLovegroup: even Singed
[0:33:36] ZCanuck: Mundo is great, SKT has shown its not an autowin
[0:33:39] Killerjayss: singed was good at worlds last season too
[0:33:56] mujarshad: what do you mean what happened with skt
[0:34:01] sqradi: SKT making every strat & champions they played look balanced LUL
[0:34:05] Bugattiz644: so ez for sng?
[0:34:12] mujarshad: their top/jg/sup are inting....
[0:34:47] JrLovegroup: SNG pretty strong but can't say how strong LGD is since they played vs IG
[0:34:48] ZCanuck: Blossom wasn't the problem
[0:35:01] Killerjayss: skt is 0-2
[0:35:05] me1n3: LUL @ZCanuck of course he was
[0:35:13] Bugattiz644: they lost 2-0 to ig
[0:35:13] Killerjayss: with 4 losses
[0:35:24] ZCanuck: he did more than Blank did, I put more blame on Kkoma selecting what he did for Faker and Bang getting stomped in lane
[0:35:29] Bugattiz644: skt been losin 2-0 every series
[0:35:32] Pagany: Lck >>> Lpl
[0:35:34] Killerjayss: 0-2 with an 0-4 match record
[0:35:59] JrLovegroup: im sure SKT will bounce back soon
[0:36:23] Killerjayss: @JrLovegroup i think they will too, but the meta will have to change to make mid lane carry again
[0:36:28] JrLovegroup: but AFS, KT rolster, Gen G and KZ are just hella strong right now
[0:36:29] me1n3: @JrLovegroup mark my words easy game for sng
[0:36:34] Killerjayss: because faker can't carry as lulu
[0:36:57] jarvitz: hi cantspeel
[0:36:59] ZCanuck: im sure part of Bang's woes was lack of a helpful support (Kennen/Shen), I dont know what they dont let Wolf back on Nami or Soraka
[0:37:11] Bugattiz644: afs vs kt roister who will win ?
[0:37:37] Killerjayss: I don't think it's the jungler's fault this time... it's just they get outclassed in all lanes
[0:37:38] o3o___________: kt
[0:37:41] me1n3: i have my money on afs but its pretty much 50/50
[0:37:57] LilShortstuf: NA LCS all 0-0 LUL
[0:38:11] Killerjayss: I'm a NA C9 fan
[0:38:18] JrLovegroup: @rame124 not saying they can't win but SNG never won a series vs LGD since 2017
[0:38:28] LilShortstuf: @killerjayss How ya feeling about the roster cahnges?
[0:38:42] Killerjayss: and 3 of our last season starters got benched.... and went 1-1 in academy
[0:38:50] me1n3: @JrLovegroup oh really ? this is my first time betting on lpl anyway but from what ive watched so far sng is better
[0:39:04] blindautisticcat: is the broadcast going to be in english?
[0:39:14] Killerjayss: that must mean that our team really sucked. so i'm glad for the changes. better players should play even though jensen and sneaky are in my top 5 favorite players
[0:39:15] LilShortstuf: Yeah this is the english channel
[0:39:19] JrLovegroup: SNG always been the better team
[0:39:46] JrLovegroup: not sure how they kept losing vs LGD but i hope they finally win
[0:39:53] me1n3: i mean all lps games are like soloq diamond games dont get me wrong its pretty bad LUL
[0:40:03] LilShortstuf: I mean I was watching EU LCS and the games are just fiestas.
[0:40:03] me1n3: *lpl
[0:40:15] 87Eli: wait what is this 144p music
[0:40:17] Killerjayss: I'm high on zeyzal.. but I don't think goldenglue and f****** keith are gonna help us @LilShortstuf
[0:40:23] ZCanuck: @rame124 but now the fiesta has gone pandemic and infected the other regions
[0:40:24] JrLovegroup: LPL>LCK atm
[0:40:27] 87Eli: is my headset broken?
[0:40:37] ZCanuck: Keith is the Blank of the ADC
[0:40:38] JrLovegroup: i think LPL will win worlds this year
[0:40:41] LilShortstuf: @JrLovegroup RNG won so that statement is true haha
[0:40:55] Killerjayss: @ZCanuck and goldenglue is the blank of mid lane
[0:41:03] blindautisticcat: I'm a hardcore lck fan but I find it really hard to be a lpl fan. I think it's mostly the casters and players that I like about the lck.
[0:41:17] me1n3: @ZCanuck of course but in the other regions u still have the structure of when to go in and waht to do in certain situations but lpl is just so freaking bad i cant call it a good league its just soloq
[0:41:22] LilShortstuf: Didnt zayzal play with sneaky before and there just wasnt good synergy there?
[0:41:23] JrLovegroup: i cant back KZ in international play
[0:41:44] Killerjayss: Am i really the only one who thinks that froskurren isn't a bad caster?? but people just post HotPokket HotPokket every time she talks
[0:41:44] ZCanuck: lpl so bad...curent holders of Rift Rivals, All Stars and MSI trophies...got to be worth something, lol
[0:41:50] JrLovegroup: So far i think Gen G will be the best in lck
[0:42:06] 87Eli: its not like that. its just because her apperance is very cool
[0:42:11] Ìè¨Ïïº: Song name?
[0:42:21] sowley25: clown fiesta waiting room ResidentSleeper
[0:42:24] LilShortstuf: @killerjayss I'll be honest I've never heard her cast. Just analyst desk. She kills in on the desk.
[0:42:25] JrLovegroup: i love Frosk when she cast
[0:42:38] Hasdealtv: live?
[0:42:44] Robinustream: 11 am cet? over three hours of waiting?
[0:43:00] Killerjayss: She is very very intelligent when she casts, she used to be a professional coach
[0:43:03] JrLovegroup: Frosk got crazy analysis
[0:43:11] Killerjayss: ^^
[0:43:33] me1n3: chat lets bet LUL lgd's toplaner inting again or not LUL i bet he plays his 2vs1 and dies 3 times in a row LUL
[0:43:49] Ludecolo: KKona Clap
[0:43:56] JrLovegroup: among all NA,EU,LCK analysis. Frosk the best analysis
[0:44:27] LilShortstuf: After last worlds Frosk's stated goal was to make the worlds finals desk this year
[0:44:33] Killerjayss: @LilShortstuf I miss EDG Ray so much in NA, he was my favorite player of all time.. he was battling depression and has gone through so much as an 18 yr old, now he is happy here so i'm happy
[0:45:06] ZCanuck: @LilShortstuf not going to happen, Papa way ahead of her IMO
[0:45:41] Killerjayss: we know that no NA casters are going to the worlds casting booth
[0:45:54] Killerjayss: they forgot what the name of lich bane was LUL
[0:46:21] ZCanuck: for me its Deficio/Quickshot/Papa I would go to for a worlds final
[0:46:34] LilShortstuf: So do you do Dash, papa, jatt, and markz for the worlds finals desk?
[0:47:10] LilShortstuf: I think that's the best casting group. Frosk said analyst desk.
[0:47:12] me1n3: markz is 2 lazy to go no LUL ?
[0:47:32] JrLovegroup: Frosk should stay in the analyst desk
[0:47:36] LilShortstuf: We need his rendition of silver scrapes though
[0:47:39] ZCanuck: noo to Markz...since worlds is in KR, i hope for some LS on the analysis desk with Dash/Jatt and Frosk
[0:47:42] odengsi: is this rerun?
