[3:19:34] emibtw: @RUSTYTheCASTER inhib means nothing at this point of the game, its just more gold. Baron has much more value
[3:19:38] mattaru: gimgoon is the only korean on this fpx team right?

[3:19:47] Mechafanboy: no way he would've got that steal though, they wanted Camille to do something desperate, Ray even flashed the wall to get Camille to do something
[3:19:54] Lev1athanGRE: B tier team
[3:20:23] emibtw: @LeviathanGRE they are timing their waves and releasing pressure from sides before grouping and pushing
[3:20:42] emibtw: but I'm sure u are much better than everyone in that team and u know better ;p
[3:21:01] Lev1athanGRE: @emibtw they could do this the same way with maximizing their vision and get higher pressure on the map

[3:21:54] emibtw: @LeviathanGRE they also had to reset for item powerspikes, its better to lose 20 seconds from baron and finish 1-2 items on carries
[3:22:11] Lev1athanGRE: @emibtw wut u said would have value if they actually TRIED to push all waves :P they didn't actually do it tho
[3:22:37] Mechafanboy: obviously they set up the waves so Gimgoon could push easier Kappa
[3:22:40] emibtw: @LeviathanGRE if they push the waves and then reset they won't have waves to push with afterwards and will wait another ~20 seconds xD
