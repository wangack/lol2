[3:50:15] Myotosis23: @TheQueenOfPatatas 10 AD for twitch ultl and 1% true damage on w isnt massive buffs

[3:51:54] Cesunana: We saw in this game that Ashe was viable, just that uzi wasn't the star of the game, and that should be perfectly fine
[3:51:56] TheQueenOfPatatas: RGNK_Pheonix20 in soloQ statistically basically every adc is viable exept maybe trist cait vayne every other adc has like 50% winrate while most non adc botlaner have a terrible winrate so idk
