[3:05:18] trisssmerigold: @hanaseru check frosk' twitter, she seemed to have them
[3:05:59] sqradi: I heard they'll only show around 20 vids or something
[3:06:00] trisssmerigold: inb4 both CHina and KOrea not qualified tho LOL
[3:06:18] tatsu824: the whole thing that the host made the qualifiers so confidential seems ridiculous to me
[3:07:07] trisssmerigold: Asian Games 2018, LPL in its classic sand bag fashion, lost to representitives from Viet, while Faker, just cant carry hard enough and a lack of coordination we see usually in LCK , lost to Australian representtives
[3:07:53] tatsu824: rumors being LMS 1st LCK 2nd LPL 3rd but no one can confirm
[3:08:03] 그렘린1201: what happen to mystic why is imp starting over him?
[3:08:12] sqradi: Those aren't rumors, LCK/LMS/LPL is qualified

[3:10:56] sqradi: good roster maybe but bad synergy/coordination
[3:10:58] 그렘린1201: cant believe people base teams off of rosters in 2018 LUL
[3:11:07] tatsu824: they technically won some games but not a single set lol
[3:11:20] trisssmerigold: the game is quite snow ball y. and its not challenger vs plat, they all master to challenger players, the difference is thin to begin with and it can be easily skewed with lack of team coordination becasue of new team mates or bad pick ban
[3:12:15] trisssmerigold: and when you lost a game cause of failure communication with jungler, youmight not want to takj with him for a while, sending your team into a losing streak
[3:12:21] 그렘린1201: @hanaseru you're prob one of those retarded reddit people who thinks if faker joined C9 they would be the best team LUL
[3:13:01] 그렘린1201: @hanaseru low IQ ape LUL
[3:13:01] trisssmerigold: and before you know it, youre disqualified, especially without a team specific coach that knows the palyers well like in LPL LCK, its a new team
[3:13:12] 그렘린1201: @hanaseru do you even play league of legends LUL

[4:11:14] Froskur1nn: I'm surprised it's not a picture of Clement wearing a headset wrong
[4:11:25] AoiiKitsune: frosk should be the most popular/famous after spawn stopped casting lpl
[4:11:30] FURIA_Chase: That's the second result
[4:11:41] Froskur1nn: I casted it WAY BEFORE SPAWN AHHHHH

[4:14:19] MisterPoppler: OMG
[4:14:19] Froskur1nn: @Linko98 Shanghai is a very international city, so it has a very unique vibe to it versus a "traditional Chinese" city that you might expect.
[4:14:48] Froskur1nn: For example, EU has more casters than us and we will cast EU's entire weekly broadcast in two days. And then have two more days of casting

[4:19:17] MisterPoppler: @Froskur1nn do you think IG will choke that hard again this split?

[4:20:14] Froskur1nn: There are 3 female casters, like five male casters, three hosts, and a handful of interviewers. I think I'm missing some of the male casters.
[4:20:18] AoiiKitsune: @Froskur1nn pls confirm my conspiracy that rookie killed theshy and the 'kitchen accident' is a cover up

[4:31:23] AustinXhensL: WRONG LEVER
[4:31:34] FURIA_Chase: that scene is the funniest scene in any movie ever
[4:31:46] Froskur1nn: It's such a great film.
[4:31:57] 그렘린1201: mystic flame watch and fly lets get it Kappa
[4:32:05] teumessianfoxes: WE just put the players in cages if they do bad.
[4:32:19] Barbarossa2018: Fros is mine ill just get her a good bottle of gin and she will switch
[4:32:23] teumessianfoxes: It's one big prison camp.

[4:32:45] FURIA_Chase: I needed to watch that scene again lol
[4:32:50] AoiiKitsune: @Froskur1nn how much would a hand tattoo hurt? no fat and so many tendons, but so many lpl players have them
[4:32:54] Barbarossa2018: ill nom that better than cookie monster does
[4:33:31] AustinXhensL: @AoiiKitsune hand tats only hurt for a minute or 2
[4:33:48] 코코키: WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[4:33:59] Barbarossa2018: heh at opl finals this year im going to yell better than that
[4:34:03] FURIA_Chase: Pain is only subjective, it's nonexistant if you are a CLG/WE fan FeelsGoodMan
[4:34:07] AoiiKitsune: ahh ok, I just heard that areas with thin skin and no muscle or fat, right on the bone hurts a lot
[4:34:25] Kipherin: @syphyt POGGERS
[4:34:29] Barbarossa2018: when i go to the footy i go home with no voice

[4:34:41] FURIA_Chase: I feel nothing FeelsGoodMan
[4:34:56] Froskur1nn: @AoiiKitsune I hear very painful. I am getting my hands done next
[4:34:57] AustinXhensL: your hand is an exception because of the whole constantly being slammed into things really hard thing
[4:34:59] cloudma27: Girls
[4:35:06] AustinXhensL: you kinda dull the nerve endings causing less pain
[4:35:07] 尼奥: WutFace girls
[4:35:09] LaoWai42: @AoiiKitsune in my experience it is the softer areas that hurt more for tattoos because the skin will vibrate more
[4:35:12] lOlUpPer: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[4:35:29] FURIA_Chase: @AoiiKitsune that's true
[4:35:30] Barbarossa2018: @Laowai42 i agree ribs didnt hurt but fat on the hip did
[4:35:31] AoiiKitsune: @Froskur1nn what are you getting?
[4:35:36] Froskur1nn: The butt crack hurts the worst in my experience
[4:35:37] AustinXhensL: ive only had 1 tat that actually hurt and that was on my chest
[4:35:41] 小步: ?
[4:35:46] cloudma27: ?
[4:35:54] Froskur1nn: @AoiiKitsune I am getting one for Sydney, Portland, and Shanghai on my hands, and foot.
[4:35:59] AoiiKitsune: butt crack right on the coccyx tho, so many nerves
[4:36:10] AoiiKitsune: so two hands one foot?
[4:36:21] Froskur1nn: So right hand will be portland rose, left will be a seagull for aus, and my foot will be a foo dog
[4:36:30] FURIA_Chase: what's your butt tattoo frosk
[4:36:38] Barbarossa2018: seagul? boxing roo tbh
[4:36:54] Froskur1nn: My entire back, from shoulders to bottom of my butt is a giant american tattoo
[4:37:08] Froskur1nn: Ship, eagle, clouds, lightening, rope, anchor, roses
[4:37:26] kinghanamaru: mystic PogChamp

[4:38:44] FURIA_Chase: I'm a Chelly fan now because he's playing Lucian VoHiYo
[4:38:47] Barbarossa2018: made up of pieces rather than a solid outline
[4:38:55] AoiiKitsune: i would get a tattoo but i don't know what to get, decision making complex
[4:39:12] Barbarossa2018: get whatever doesnt have to mean anything
[4:39:31] cloudma27: Girls

[4:40:00] robmonk: Frosk, what do you think of OMGs draft this game?
[4:40:01] definitely_Diana: This is Missing in Action
[4:40:06] Froskur1nn: @AoiiKitsune I've of the mentality that some of my tattoos I'd like to change, but even if I don't like the tattoo, I like the memory of the moment
[4:40:07] FURIA_Chase: MISSING POGGERS
[4:40:07] AustinXhensL: get a butterfly centered on the beltline
[4:40:10] Barbarossa2018: find a picture you like
[4:40:18] yarrrghmatey: WE SMOrc MAD SMOrc
[4:40:42] Barbarossa2018: dont think ill get colour anymore though
[4:40:52] Froskur1nn: @robmonk I really dislike ryze in this meta. With Xin Zhao it should be about river control, but WE are getting the faster rotation and the Xin/Ryze isn't being as impactful as it needs to be
[4:40:53] Barbarossa2018: say more by having less
[4:41:06] AustinXhensL: butterfly centered on the beltline is clearly the best tattoo
[4:41:08] alma_de_la_muerte: HeyGuys LPL LCK has finished

[4:41:43] HanseiLove: we 1set adc how?

[4:42:09] Froskur1nn: Close the hatches, team. A storm is coming
[4:42:10] AoiiKitsune: rip LPL chat
[4:42:12] Mrbrightside098: @AoiiKitsune just ended
[4:42:14] CptRexBuckingham: lck just ended
[4:42:16] FURIA_Chase: LCK ended like 30 seconds ago
[4:42:20] robmonk: @Froskur1nn I don't understand the Xin pick more than anything. Don't understand how it synchronizes with team or vs WE - the fiddle seems like a bad pick too.
[4:42:23] definitely_Diana: Did LCK end?
[4:42:25] Barbarossa2018: show bobs and vegane?
[4:42:25] unclearhate: Sub-only mode monkaS
[4:42:26] AustinXhensL: @AoiiKitsune butterfly centered right above the beltline in the middle of your back

[4:42:43] greyyy_: yé 2-0 GRF and 2-0 MVP
[4:42:52] Kipherin: skt LUL
[4:42:58] AoiiKitsune: GRF Kreygasm
[4:43:04] Froskur1nn: @robmonk Xin and Fiddles are both "matchup" picks. Xin has incredibly skirmish potential and usually gets river control - which is why it's weird that they picked into Taliyah, seeing that WE countered out that idea with mid priority.
[4:43:30] Miitniick: Faker will leave skt after this split ... quote me Kapp
[4:43:38] Froskur1nn: @robmonk So the idea is that xin should camp mid and just kill Taliyah over and over with locked CC since she should be shoving the wave. Jeikou just nonexistant.
[4:43:51] FURIA_Chase: One last question Frosk what do you think of the roster switch for Fnatic?
[4:43:56] AustinXhensL: who cares about faker, this is china
[4:44:09] FURIA_Chase: Rekkles benched for Bwipo
[4:44:13] Barbarossa2018: need to bring back Naut jungle
[4:44:22] AoiiKitsune: wait wtf
[4:44:25] Froskur1nn: @syphyt I think fans should be excited to see Fnatic trying something new and embracing the meta.
[4:44:38] Miitniick: this is lck LUL
[4:44:41] AoiiKitsune: have they played with that roster yet?
[4:44:53] AoiiKitsune: THIS IS LCK CHAT NOW Kappa
[4:44:56] mooonqc: did everyone see the results of asia game qualifiers
[4:44:57] FURIA_Chase: That's my feeling exactly Frosk, a lot of people are upset though
[4:45:07] Miitniick: @froskur1nn rekkles played janna LUL
[4:45:08] nothingishappening: BegWan
[4:45:21] Froskur1nn: I'd rather see two top laners than Rekkles on Janna again
[4:45:21] FURIA_Chase: I'm glad FNC are utilizing their great toplaners
[4:45:25] kuuarti: Fnatic must have planned something 2 tank 2 support and 1 hypercarry

[4:50:02] AustinXhensL: but were back to win lane win game again

[5:12:57] l0vemist: Faker didn't lose, SKT lost.
[5:13:02] fwrento: skt played their bench?
[5:13:02] Solzstice: you can't say "the team that won worlds" this isn't the same fucking team
