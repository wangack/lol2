[7:36:15] matuscaravey: hope rw play the 3 game better than this
[7:36:16] yam276: @matuscaravey yes
[7:36:18] CR0NA_: 1 kill for baron and 4 kills, worth
[7:36:43] ACMastrpiece: thats why he has mobis so he can just run away
[7:36:46] Mechafanboy: I mean game was pretty much over the moment Talon doesn't get ahead.
[7:37:20] 藍色髮夾: honestly talon is just a shitty pick
[7:37:23] Endaldren_: i doubt it. rogue warriors play too much off emotion and after this loss idk how they will come back. Maybe we will get a super carry DoinB Kled game
[7:37:30] Mechafanboy: the fact that he not only didn't get ahead but got killed twice (and then more times LuL ) is just icing on the cake.
[7:37:59] ACMastrpiece: i just like rw style
[7:38:00] CR0NA_: LUL

[7:40:15] decco41: just ban rakan from Yoon 4Head
[7:40:31] Mechafanboy: KZ probably needs to chill more, think they got too jittery on the day and then combined with unconventional pick from Doinb.... nothing much more to be said there imo.
[7:40:32] roll1ng1: this should have been a 2-0 for SNG again
[7:40:45] Mechafanboy: I'd still pick KZ anyday in a bo3/5

[7:45:19] sqradi: Is it still possible for JDG or SNG to go?
[7:45:22] Froskur1nn: I think Uzi is going to win worlds
[7:45:23] CR0NA_: i hope RW make worlds tbh
[7:45:29] clockwork67: he had to one up faker with the gold brannd
[7:45:34] RustyTheCaster: Absolutely, it's possible for both to go! More likely that JDG do than SNG
[7:45:39] clockwork67: #yearofuzi
[7:45:49] sqradi: I hope JDG does BlessRNG
[7:45:50] RustyTheCaster: Champ points aka gauntlet qualifiers is not SNG favoured just yet
[7:46:09] Froskur1nn: For SNG or JDG to qualify for regional qualifiers
[7:46:18] muonz: BLG are gonna make playoffs Kappa
[7:46:19] Endaldren_: I would also love to see Rogue Warriors at worlds :)
[7:46:20] Ecosta03: It’s replay or live???
[7:46:23] Froskur1nn: they'd have to make 3rd or something to get the invite
[7:46:36] cryyylovee: LUL
[7:47:01] sqradi: That seems something they might be able to do hopefully
[7:47:27] clockwork67: can some1 enlighten me... few months ago I read about one of the lpl teams having a trainee ad that was accused of scripting so they flew him in to play... w hatever happened to him?
[7:47:36] Froskur1nn: That means they'd have to beat two of RW, EDG, iG, RNG in a Bo5
[7:48:04] sqradi: RNG needs to be on their side LUL
[7:48:23] dem0niak: h2k 0-7 LUL
[7:48:28] Froskur1nn: They'd have to finish second in their conference to be on opposite brackets to RNG
[7:48:57] Froskur1nn: But that means you're still getting iG and EDG
[7:49:06] Mechafanboy: I guess the one that was "scripting" would be Able? He's still on RNG, just his competition is against Uzi so he didn't play much.
[7:49:23] sqradi: That is a bit tough 🤔
[7:49:54] sqradi: But if EDG or IG beats them then JDG isn't ready for worlds
[7:50:53] Froskur1nn: I just crushed some humus and it was delicious
