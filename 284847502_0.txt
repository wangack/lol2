[9:00:20] grandgusting: 华人的父母或祖辈是不是中国人啊？
[9:00:22] trisssmerigold: hey guys, its because LCk has better production value and casters

[9:02:02] Nilfgaaaard: @uqbar_ but there is Korean caster as well, still many viewerships in English streaming
[9:02:05] panda_mn: 这是国外的平台看lpl少正常

[9:07:21] mysweetheart: 其实俱乐部韩援也没什么但有些队伍太迷信韩援就很畸形了
[9:07:31] heledabendan: 譬如
[9:07:36] monkeydran: I'm not a fan of any region or team, I am just a fan of whoever is playing the best League of Legends in the world. And right now, that just happens to be Team Solo MId.
[9:07:38] kukaoaa: AJ LUL

[9:08:11] LeDieTeam: SuperVinlin
[9:08:15] 1717drug: 現在lck和lpl差距變得很小了 不用在依靠外援
[9:08:16] panda_mn: EDG中单不c必输
[9:08:18] dioguuh: @monkeydran CoolStoryBob
[9:08:25] 메탈맥스: 你知道么？我懂韩文，经常看LCK的观众的评论，只要是有韩国外援的队伍获胜了，他们就狠劲夸奖，自己国家的选手
[9:08:43] future20200914: 韩国人输不起
[9:08:47] holyyyd: 韩国人电竞确实牛B啊，要承认，在中国打游戏就被喷不务正业 LUL
[9:08:59] 萊克多巴蛙: 这不废话吗 不都是赢了夸 输了使劲喷 每个赛区都一样
[9:09:05] mysweetheart: 是啊如果我们也有输出过去的选手能有举足轻重的地位我也很开心
[9:09:07] panda_mn: 我们dota2比他们牛批
[9:09:18] panda_mn: 他们牛在lol
[9:09:24] heledabendan: 正常的假如中国选手出去当外援国人也会这样的
[9:09:25] 1717drug: 我們感覺越來越能包容了 對那些噴的也噴回去
[9:09:25] redpack3t: Doinb已经被韩国人说是中国人了
[9:09:31] LeDieTeam: 现在还是lck更强势点
[9:09:44] future20200914: 韩国LOL没人比的过，真是厉害了
[9:09:55] mysweetheart: 没成绩说啥都是废话这点是话粗理不粗
[9:09:56] roit9669: 也没必要出去,比LPL有钱的赛区可能只有NA了
[9:09:58] 메탈맥스: 但是，他们内心认为没有韩国外援，是赢不了LCK的
[9:10:07] heledabendan: 爱操心的众网友已经在想办法让doinb拿中国永久居住权了hhhh
[9:10:21] holyyyd: 韩国人 LUL
[9:10:22] 萊克多巴蛙: RNG没有韩援啊
[9:10:25] LeDieTeam: 我觉得实话
[9:10:31] mysweetheart: 因为韩援在对上LCK的时候总会是不是出问题
[9:10:40] LeDieTeam: 没有韩媛的lpl还是不能跟lck比
[9:10:54] xniverz: RNG WON?
[9:11:00] lixiangqing: yes
[9:11:02] 萊克多巴蛙: yes
[9:11:04] 1717drug: 那沒毛病 最開始就是韓援提升了lpl的水平
[9:11:10] xniverz: :D :D :D
[9:11:15] mysweetheart: 是的
[9:11:26] heledabendan: 主要是韩国的教练买的比较好
[9:11:31] 메탈맥스: 应该是韩援教练团队
[9:11:50] 메탈맥스: 韩援选手比重不大的
[9:11:51] AraGakk1Yui: 要我LPL赢几次RR这帮外国佬才愿意看LPL
[9:11:52] mysweetheart: 现在国内直播好做有些人也不愿做教练
[9:11:56] heledabendan: 韩媛的比赛水平和中文水平成正比的 LOL沟通很重要
[9:12:10] AraGakk1Yui: LUL LUL LUL
[9:12:11] heledabendan: doinb肉鸡中文都很好
[9:12:15] rlalabobo: 引進技術 複製 再升級
[9:12:21] holyyyd: 不是啊 一直那么多人
[9:12:23] lixiangqing: scout也不差
[9:12:28] 萊克多巴蛙: 要想老外看LPL 这几个LPL解说换成PAPA就行了
[9:12:32] heledabendan: 对
