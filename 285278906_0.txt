[0:53:57] scottoflorida2014: @freeko Agreed I don't know if its good or bad it fell thru in EU for 2019
[0:54:09] freeko: its good
[0:54:21] charle97: @scottofl2014 c9 won't make worlds

[0:54:48] dapper_tv: where is marin
[0:54:52] CouchNick: @scottofl2014 lets say you just compared the worst team in league atm with the best one
[0:54:54] freeko: you can already see how bad NA has become as a region after only a single year of franchising their region
[0:55:09] dapper_tv: @freeko stfu eu pleb u just as bad
[0:55:12] scottoflorida2014: WOW, I read that C9 was like top tier, ONe of the best
[0:55:16] Coach_Dur1el: music LUL
[0:55:28] freeko: c9 is the 5th best team in NA imho
[0:55:38] Knejt: c9th

[0:56:24] scottoflorida2014: well damn
[0:56:28] ajhockey: NA is more of a money-making region than a performance region
[0:56:29] CouchNick: bo1 increases sponsor money and viewership so i get it :^)
[0:56:30] freeko: i know why they went to the best of 1 format, and it was the wrong reason
[0:56:36] 상혁팬: Is Lck no match today?
[0:56:37] 桃園伊莉雅: its not about franchising. the region has never been good.
[0:56:42] mexican_boxbox: will MaRin play today?
[0:56:52] bgijy1: @michaeljackson110 yeah, mondays LCK has off
[0:56:52] freeko: look at the good regions (lpl, lck) that play i think 6 days a week

[0:57:31] Knejt: reddit wheelchair analysts
[0:57:33] CouchNick: @charle97 If you put all teams in a match in one weekend, you'll get alot more views than if you spread it out in the week
[0:57:42] scottoflorida2014: LPL is taking over, LCK will be a constant second and then maybe an EU/NA team will find a lucky win once in awhile
[0:57:49] eat_beast: Fortnite is killing league because young players play it over League i am sure Riot is aware of this
[0:57:51] ajhockey: TSM getting bad really hurt the high end of NALCS numbers
[0:58:15] 1kenn1: Bjerg is so washed
[0:58:18] charle97: @PainPlayer14 nalcs hasn't been played over a week
[0:58:19] eat_beast: league isnt getting more new players, bo1 franchising all doesnt matter
[0:58:20] scottoflorida2014: @eat_beast Doublelift made a good video for Riot and brought that game up
[0:58:23] ajhockey: They used to get 200k when TSM was dominant, but now that they're middling, they get far fewer and I guess a lot of TSM fans would rather just not watch at all than watch an average TSM
[0:58:32] panpan1991: H8K LUL
[0:58:35] kepzzz: any idea who's gonna win on the 1st match?
[0:58:44] ajhockey: @charle97 they played two days ago
[0:58:45] NaMeiiii: TOP without marin will win
[0:58:52] CouchNick: @charle97 wait what? im saying that nalcs is putting all their games in one weekend, that wouldnt fit with bo3
[0:58:55] freeko: tsm is just average for what NA is now and the random best of 1 makes it worse for them because you make a mistake and you lose a best of 1
[0:58:56] ajhockey: @charle97 wait, no, just yesterday actually

[1:10:13] smolpotatofren: I think if they were trying to "fix" it that we'd have already seen some hot fixes most likely. Unless they're embarrssed for making the "mistake"? not sure if that's the case tho

[1:10:53] Husky_Trades: The reason NA will never be good is because there is no motivation to win. Switching to franchising made players worse.

[1:14:40] Gunerdrag: if worlds is played today TSM wins worlds
[1:14:44] NaMeiiii: Riot gonna change the meta drastically before worlds just like 2015 FeelsBadMan
[1:14:45] yuio3456: korea is a mess lmaooo
[1:14:45] Minstro: KT time to win worlds more like PogChamp
[1:14:46] ajhockey: Personally, I thing RNG is the best team in the world, but outside of that, LCK is better than LPL
[1:14:47] GorditoBanditoTV: even if uzi is still on leave? @papasmithy

[1:15:33] Never_Golden_Kappa: LMS without FW 4Head
[1:15:34] wzrdtrx_tv: enjoy your day off @PapaSmithy
[1:15:35] PapaSmithy: I think it's impossible to rate Griffin on best of 5/international performance, especially compared to teams who have already performed
[1:15:40] Grondjuice0: Its definitely OPLs chance!
[1:15:42] smolpotatofren: I think the next meta shift will really tell us who GRF are.
[1:15:43] will_o_will: @PapaSmithy if KT cant make worlds this year, I will be so upset
[1:15:44] PapaSmithy: too many variables I can't see to make an informed judgement
