[4:16:41] SwagtrickTV: @roqtt I didnt notice the no nexus tower haha. Could they just fast forward till the end on twitch? Start game nr. 2 instead of wasting time?
[4:16:41] sqradi: The fact that FPX took THIS long to win against RNG's troll draft is more embarrassing for FPX LUL
[4:16:41] 69TV: they had nothing to reaööy kill the varus
[4:16:48] dngzeta: FPX1:0RNG

[4:20:33] will_o_will: uzi is not injured he is playing nba 2k with friends at home
[4:20:34] Sknon_: not a big fan of the casting :"(
[4:20:45] pandaloves5503: 你好我叫妹妹他我是土耳其人
[4:20:49] RustyTheCaster: Sorry you feel that way @darksouls3ftw
[4:20:53] RustyTheCaster: how could we make it better for you?
[4:21:06] BaldursDottir: Not loving this delayed game thing.. I'd rather have watched the end of this game in real time lolz
[4:21:18] pandaloves5503: 你是中国人吗
[4:21:19] H_trx: @aremca3 why
[4:21:26] lansquid: PopCorn RaccAttack
[4:21:29] RustyTheCaster: I personally agree, but a lot of our LPL viewers are VOD watchers
[4:21:45] 小步: GRILLLL
[4:21:48] RustyTheCaster: so if we just live jump in at ~40 minutes it ruins their experience
[4:22:01] Nilfgaaaard: GIRLL Kreygasm
[4:22:06] sqradi: VOD watchers 😡 if you see this, you did this. 😡
[4:22:09] シロト: so can we skip the rest time
[4:22:09] skilex_lol: 4Head
[4:22:14] RustyTheCaster: VOD watchers <3
[4:22:29] decco41: 4Head
[4:22:59] H0tdude: why u wanna jump into the middle? the early lvl fights are pretty amusing in my oppinion
[4:23:09] lansquid: ^
[4:23:09] gendsi: 4Head
[4:23:12] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: this casting ResidentSleeper
[4:23:13] JJNinjaa: Rusty. the majority of your viewers right now is sitting on LPL main youtube forced to watch it in chineese just because we want the live event.
[4:23:14] ChaoS2751: Deleted
[4:23:15] Nilfgaaaard: THE RANG Kreygasm
[4:23:20] skilex_lol: Ap cho
[4:23:21] RainbowTeddys: The cast seems a little rusty Kappa
[4:23:22] 小步: @RUSTYTheCASTER but you don't cast for Tue. Wed. :(
[4:23:25] HeNeArKrXe: keep feeding
[4:23:32] MagikLimbo: so balsnced
[4:23:36] medleyalmanac: PogChamp
[4:23:43] BaldursDottir: @H_trx I guess because if it's live and I yell at my pc,xiaohu might hear me and play better?
[4:23:45] antotakudesu: LUL
[4:23:45] MagikLimbo: one shot
[4:24:15] H_trx: @aremca3 reasonable
[4:24:26] baybaypig: AP Chogath PogChamp
[4:24:26] RustyTheCaster: I understand that
[4:24:28] sqradi: @Aremca3 xiaohu played out of his mind with all those steals tho
[4:24:55] RustyTheCaster: But I also do not conceivably know a way to do both live casting when they start at 5 and 7pm every damn day not 5 and 8 or doing a full game for consistency
[4:24:56] Wool_Tea: But Darius CAN kill Mundo if he isn't thrown behind
[4:25:01] steady87663: FPX WIN
[4:25:35] BaldursDottir: @roqtt doesn't matter.. I'm worried about next game.. I want to yell at him live!
[4:26:00] sqradi: @Aremca3 LUL understandable
[4:26:25] Namvp: what
[4:26:28] lansquid: i feel for Pulse and Frosk a bit tho, with virtually no time to prep for casting and have to jump straight into another game CorgiDerp
[4:26:36] KYSSADIN_: is this a replay from s7 ResidentSleeper
[4:26:40] ChaoS2751: I don’t see what’s wrong talking about mistakes
[4:26:42] BaldursDottir: @VisLaud_RlyTho true.
[4:26:43] sqradi: MLXD
[4:26:48] RustyTheCaster: I'd like to think we praise strengths, but we also just call out bad plays as bad
[4:26:58] RustyTheCaster: I think there's a notable inclusion of both personally, but the % can shift
[4:28:02] RustyTheCaster: Sure, we aren't perfect and I'll be the first to admit we make mistakes like that
[4:28:05] HeNeArKrXe: When does UZI come back
[4:28:19] RustyTheCaster: It changes per caster and per game so perhaps you're right :)
[4:28:26] will_o_will: end of the season no specific timeline tho
[4:28:27] gendsi: not soon
[4:28:39] alexandrsnt: i understand why some people may not like it but i love how yall dont scream everytime there's an important play
[4:29:06] alexandrsnt: the casters in my region scream everytime i just get tired :\
[4:29:18] HeNeArKrXe: UZI comes back at the end of this meta?
[4:29:26] Namvp: varus etf
[4:29:29] 小步: PLZ CAST ON TUE AND WED IN ENGLISH :(
[4:29:34] sqradi: they should though, sometimes I'm working on other stuff but I tune in when casters get hyped so I know an important play happened
[4:29:37] kaffemugen: I actually really like the LPL and the casters too! :D
[4:29:42] ChaoS2751: Too deep Kreygasm
[4:29:44] RustyTheCaster: We want to do Tuesdays and Weds!
[4:29:47] Sknon_: @RUSTYTheCASTER don't mind me a lot, maybe I'm used to NA\EU play casters, they bring a lot of hype to the games, but here I feel like the casting is so chill, for example when Cho choped Taliyah with his feast they didn't react to that at all and it felt like oh that did happen what's new
[4:30:01] ChaoS2751: This is a weird game
[4:30:18] lansquid: ^gets weirder
[4:30:19] H_trx: @roqtt if its really your passiom it should come naturally.
[4:30:19] RustyTheCaster: @darksouls3ftw I think that's totally valid! Some added context for you that perhaps flavours the opinion:
[4:30:32] RustyTheCaster: We have 340 games minimum a split compared to NA's 100~
[4:30:34] 小步: EVEN THOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND CHINESE, I STILL WANT ENGLISH CAST
[4:30:48] BaldursDottir: "charge 3 inches up river"- ouch
[4:31:07] sqradi: @H_trx even if it isn't their passion, they need to bc they are paid to do this LUL
[4:31:25] PermaSmug: AP CHOGATH IS META VisLaud
[4:31:29] will_o_will: bring back papa and altus...miss the days When papa in lpl
[4:31:32] kaffemugen: I dont think u need to hype up the LPL games, they are already actionpacked, the NA/EU cast needs to do cause they games are very slow.
[4:31:33] stringhaha: 他说这两天会直播说，还没
[4:31:37] H_trx: @roqtt ye but forced hype is fucking awful. id rather have chill
[4:31:39] 小步: RIOT HIRE MORE CASTERS PLZ SwiftRage
[4:31:45] decco41: PermaSmug
[4:31:48] GLPhoenix: some of the people who say that the casters need to show more hype are also those who saying things like "ugh, fake hype"
[4:31:56] ccjmne: The casters get pretty hyped when Uzi dodges 3 ults in ~1 second :P
[4:32:00] LOurlodaddy: is this replay?
[4:32:02] Sebkan1234: from 0/3 to 7/3 lol
[4:32:09] ccjmne: Maybe they genuinely don't really get crazy over a Cho Gath ult when it doesn't amount to much else (and didn't even require flash-ing)
[4:32:17] alexandrsnt: yeah sorry but NA casters just scream and scream and it feels very forced
[4:32:19] sqradi: @H_trx well between forced and chill i'd take chill, but it'd be nice if there's natural hype FeelsBadMan
[4:32:25] RustyTheCaster: Yeah that's the other thing I was going to add sorry I got distracted
[4:32:32] AoiiKitsune: wait did firefox leave RNG?
[4:32:36] will_o_will: LCK games are slow too
[4:32:38] RustyTheCaster: we have hype moments but on average we're so bloody and action packed we can't yell at every detail
[4:32:39] decco41: Able in game2 PogChamp
[4:32:39] bottle_hk: 152 LUL
[4:32:43] Sebkan1234: yea EU casters also scream all the time so fucking anoyuing
[4:32:44] KYSSADIN_: @LOurlodaddy ye s7 replay because im sleeping ResidentSleeper
[4:32:44] RustyTheCaster: we wouldn't have a voice and you would be annoyed
[4:32:49] 面长宽碗大圆: YES
[4:33:01] H_trx: @roqtt ye i agree, but i feel like lpl casting gets more intense in playoffs since they have so many games
[4:33:01] William10shih: @rustythecaster. Riot change the anchor in Lpl?
[4:33:08] RustyTheCaster: The anchor?
[4:33:15] William10shih: yes
[4:33:24] RustyTheCaster: What?
[4:33:30] GLPhoenix: its a boat now?
[4:33:33] lunarwolffff: who won, jdg or rw?

[4:34:03] RNGRoyal: Able is playing ADC game 2
[4:34:07] William10shih: I use f@cking google translate
[4:34:12] H_trx: @roqtt same lpl has so many good teams right now
[4:34:13] xxxtrafalgarx: Frosk is displeased with how RNG plays
[4:34:18] will_o_will: @rustythecaster Does the 3rd seed of LPL still need to play playin stage for worlds this year
[4:34:19] Sebkan1234: NA and EU are hyping stuff up that aint hype, like every TF they have to scream, and if u look ot Korea lck, they are watching and points stuff out. insted of screaming
[4:34:27] alexandrsnt: ^
[4:34:27] AoiiKitsune: zzitai mlxg xiaohu able ming for game 2
[4:34:29] RustyTheCaster: I do not know for certain sorry will
[4:34:34] kaffemugen: @RUSTYTheCASTER just wanna say i really enjoy ur casting, you have become my favourite caster! :D
[4:34:37] Zeshiark: ??
[4:34:42] RustyTheCaster: Thanks @kaffemugen !
[4:34:44] greedeez: Who won JDG or RW ?
[4:34:45] halloderbaer: @William10shih the people at analyst desk change constantly between casting and analysing
[4:34:47] KYSSADIN_: wtf this bluebuff on zoe
[4:34:53] will_o_will: @rustythecaster np
[4:35:01] H_trx: jdg

[4:35:21] AoiiKitsune: uzi is on medical elave

[4:35:54] Nilfgaaaard: @rustythecaster Did you guys watch all the vods when there was no English casting?
[4:36:03] Endaldren_: Who won the first match?
[4:36:17] RustyTheCaster: We watch the Tuesday Wednesday VOD's with no English if that's what you mean
[4:36:21] Kuzy: Jdg
[4:36:27] RustyTheCaster: At least I assume the other casters do, I do
[4:36:44] AoiiKitsune: do you watch it in chinese or the clean feed?
[4:36:46] blackmanhidinginkfc: FeelsBadMan
[4:36:51] professor_wormbog_: @RUSTYTheCASTER LPL has the best overall quality in casting/hosting IMO. I love the personalities and analysis
[4:36:53] RustyTheCaster: If I'm watching live I watch in Chinese
[4:37:04] H_trx: i actually enjoy the clean feed vods from time to time
[4:37:13] lansquid: 2nd game starting, for anyone who prefers live VoHiYo (ima stay here with my tea TPFufun )
[4:37:13] dngzeta: 难道就我一个中国人吗
[4:37:14] Nilfgaaaard: @rustythecaster So did you turn on the Chinese casting when you was watching those vods?
[4:37:24] RustyTheCaster: During VOD's no
[4:37:26] RustyTheCaster: Just when live
[4:37:31] Nilfgaaaard: Oh I see
[4:37:44] RustyTheCaster: I usually dont watch any vod's with casting on, I mute them all
[4:37:44] martin4903: 中國人 安安
[4:37:57] RustyTheCaster: weird habit I know but I can't concentrate on a VOD unless there's relaxing music on behind it
