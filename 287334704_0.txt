[3:06:35] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Duke one of the best toplaners from LCK of all time. The best toplaner from SKT ever and goes to LPL and is mediocre. LPL competitive scene is on a complete different level compared to the LCK.
[3:06:38] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Half of LCK is better than Faker, Rookie being better than Faker is meaningless, Rookie would be 5th or lower in LCK
