[6:02:40] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: LPL has the best adcs in the world. The worst adc in LPL is as good as the best in LCK.. for example IMP best adc of all time from LCK goes to LPL and is kinda low tier. The real worlds is LPL. Thats why LPL doesn't care about winning worlds when they win more tournaments than LCK per year.

[8:04:20] 日狗少年史大彪: 第一场也差不多了 拿优势不做事 中野辅在红区乱晃被抓
[8:04:29] WinterStorme: thanks for enabling OMEGALUL it's the ugliest emote on bttv
[8:04:36] WinterStorme: i mean for not* FailFish
[8:04:45] 1321157243: karsa最近状态真的不想
[8:05:06] llersmile07: POGGERS
[8:05:10] 娜娜奇山豬: 會不會想嘗試新套路結果反而最後連養狗那套都玩不起來
[8:05:18] heledabendan: karsa状态没问题的 就是大龙处理有问题
[8:05:24] 歐歐八迪: RNG没UZI输了我一点都不慌
[8:05:30] 1321157243: 这局真的看不懂 很气
[8:05:42] martin4903: 怎麼輸啦 = =
[8:05:44] 萊克多巴蛙: 以前不怕被抢 现在是很怕被抢
[8:05:53] 1321157243: 输了就是菜 别说了 惩戒不存在的
[8:05:56] heledabendan: 拼惩戒这种事
[8:05:59] tood_m: 而且这两场虽然输了但是看着也不慌 状态没问题的
[8:06:00] 日狗少年史大彪: 只是缺UZI而已 以前拿优势不用那么着急做事的 可以等小狗装备
[8:06:07] heledabendan: 输了不一定是坏事
[8:06:08] blue0929: RNG现在打的怎么这么犹犹豫豫啊？
[8:06:10] tood_m: 8.13
[8:06:17] smileycoco21: KARSA INTING
[8:06:20] 娜娜奇山豬: 以前都是Karsa搶別人欸，怎麼現在變這樣
[8:06:21] 1321157243: rng没以前果敢
[8:06:28] heledabendan: 希望他们能意识到自己的问题变强吧 现在是变菜了 估计是有点膨胀了
[8:06:34] lansquid: 这次下来绝对是有大龙阴影了 希望不要太影响表现啊
[8:06:36] 萊克多巴蛙: 可能人员其上场 不知道听谁的指挥了
[8:06:38] 1321157243: 没uzi之后打的畏畏缩缩
[8:07:07] 日狗少年史大彪: 因为他们知道优势不够大 也没AD 后期打不过只能加快节奏吃大龙了
[8:07:08] redpack3t: 所有队都有状态好状态差的时候，大赛前调整过来就好了
[8:07:13] tood_m: 我是不认为这几场有什么问题 输了是输了 其实无所谓
[8:07:16] 日狗少年史大彪: 然后龙处理又很糟糕
[8:07:20] 娜娜奇山豬: 話說，RNG主call是誰阿?
[8:07:20] martin4903: 咖薩根香鍋走太近
[8:07:26] 娜娜奇山豬: KappaPride KappaPride

[8:07:32] Namigod: raz/s face
[8:07:32] 歐歐八迪: 别奶，RNG就是个保级队好吧
[8:07:53] martin4903: RNG 世界冠軍還是穩啦
[8:07:57] heledabendan: RNG多输几场吧 多认识一下自己的错误 世界赛不远了
[8:07:58] zhanhaoaida: 这都能怪小虎？？？？我擦
[8:07:59] 娜娜奇山豬: 你還不是在奶
[8:08:04] 日狗少年史大彪: 明面说的是小明 看麦克疯的话一般后期UZI小虎说的比较多
[8:08:09] martin4903: 有UZI 的話 怎麼輸
[8:08:17] 1321157243: karsa小虎各种睿智操作就很气
[8:08:35] peterpans01: who won?
[8:08:38] lansquid: 就怕rng季后赛又要爬梯然后其中任何一个环节失足出问题 希望能调整过来 嗯
[8:08:38] 娜娜奇山豬: cmonBruh cmonBruh
[8:08:41] blue0929: 感觉小虎只是锦上添花的那种选手 carry局不多
[8:08:42] 萊克多巴蛙: RW
[8:08:42] twitchdigimon: 為什麼不讓faker上
[8:08:43] 1321157243: uzi现在养伤 上不了场
[8:08:45] 娜娜奇山豬: RW win
[8:08:45] heledabendan: RW

[8:08:58] 日狗少年史大彪: 这几场明显问题很大 点爆破果实双飞都能失误的 膨胀
[8:08:59] peterpans01: RNG Without Uzi, LuL
[8:09:04] FK_P: RW 2-0
[8:09:05] 歐歐八迪: RW本来就不弱 输了也不见得是坏事啊兄弟
[8:09:12] smileycoco21: NO UZI NO WIN LUL
[8:09:22] 萊克多巴蛙: 那输FPX怎么说？
[8:09:22] blinkumoitodois: melon13 you trash ! do not hype melon13 !
[8:09:25] 娜娜奇山豬: 我大牛排果然行
[8:09:29] martin4903: 讓UZI 休息一下
[8:09:29] blue0929: 连输两场了会不会影响季后赛啊
[8:09:37] tood_m: 比赛内容是可以的
[8:09:48] FK_P: melao13 LUL
[8:09:52] Gamabunta33tv: isnät uzi playing for RNG anymore? or what?
[8:09:55] 娜娜奇山豬: 戰績不佳不會，就怕氣勢和心情會影響
[8:09:55] tood_m: 7-3 和rw一样的
[8:10:04] lansquid: 主要是上次浪的有点大 连比fpx都能玩输
[8:10:08] Gamabunta33tv: isn't *
[8:10:11] 萊克多巴蛙: 估计卡莎要自闭了
[8:10:14] swineflu111: UZI plays for TSM now
