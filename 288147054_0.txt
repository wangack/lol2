[2:18:02] FK_P: tfw you will never get to see loken, key, athena and ares together in lck
[2:18:04] PreacherCasts: Yeah, but EDG have traditionally had louder chants so......
[2:18:07] Bunnything: @RUSTYTheCASTER do you prefer the way NA does their LCS with Bo1's or the LCK style?
[2:18:13] grandgusting: 韩国rank第一名是中国人
[2:18:15] vghost_zzz: 3 MEN BOT
[2:18:26] 国人晓迪: 不是 LUL
[2:18:27] 菸草兒: WTF?
[2:18:30] 萊克多巴蛙: 红老嗨 那是远古时期了 LUL

[2:18:36] gouv23: ?
[2:18:37] LaoWai42: @Bunnything i believe you meant to say the LPL style
[2:18:39] RustyTheCaster: I personally prefer Bo1 as a viewer, but Bo3 as everything else
[2:18:49] xuejingbosb: 第一那又怎么样 还不是比不上韩国人
[2:18:51] 菸草兒: 5555555555
[2:18:54] xuejingbosb: 你是弱智吗
[2:18:57] FURIA_Chase: slapped

[2:19:14] grandgusting: 是吗？比不上韩国人？
[2:19:16] vlikevenci: gg
[2:19:17] Kuvo1379: @RUSTYTheCASTER the way NA tried do do bo3 was the worst ever tho, since u would have 2 streams at the same time competing for views
[2:19:21] tatsu824: 又不是他不想打
[2:19:23] gouv23: NotLikeThis
[2:19:26] nero15199: na teams 2 games one week Kappa
[2:19:26] smolpotatofren: Square peg round hole, they made it happen lol
[2:19:27] rCRlMSON: Gnar?
[2:19:29] Nuddle8: @RUSTYTheCASTER let's be honest, China is very lucky to have this viewer base and population. They can sustain bo3 for both the show and regional improvement
[2:19:31] grandgusting: 精韩主义狗
[2:19:34] rCRlMSON: Gnar afk FeelsBadMan
[2:19:35] RustyTheCaster: @kuvo1379 that isn't strictly far off we are doing now
[2:19:41] TennoMouse: 山猪骑士是猪头刚来的时候的梗吧? LUL
[2:19:45] Gurrk1sh: that aint falco
[2:19:47] Bunnything: I mean.
[2:19:51] PreacherCasts: Bo3 is so much better than Bo1. What's more important: a random game or your promos?
[2:19:52] RustyTheCaster: The LPL has start times of 5 and 7pm because we have 6 stadiums across the country, so often game 3's cut into set 2
[2:19:54] Kuvo1379: @RUSTYTheCASTER u have multiple days atleast, they cramped it into 3 days
[2:19:58] janepatrick3323: Gen.G ..Worlds 2018 winner !!!

[2:20:06] xuejingbosb: 精你吗的 b
[2:20:11] Bunnything: like way worse
[2:20:14] FURIA_Chase: LPL doesn't even cast all their games in english
[2:20:15] 国人晓迪: 我真的是你🐴的佛了
[2:20:19] RustyTheCaster: The LCS is a strong independent region that don't need no copying
[2:20:24] Kuvo1379: @RUSTYTheCASTER the analyst was pretty confused most of the time, since u had 2 guys looking at both streams for tha analyst desk
[2:20:27] smolpotatofren: Good flash to avoid that kill from pyke made it happen
[2:20:30] lovenishimiya: BO1 is really not good... in BO3 you can adjust and also a good practice going into play off stages
[2:20:36] FURIA_Chase: Not hating on LPL I love you guys but it is busy in China league scene
[2:20:37] nero15199: everyone has pc in china
[2:20:38] tatsu824: with more teams settle their home court down this could be even more common
[2:20:39] RustyTheCaster: Yeah, it's hard for us to know both sets at the same time
[2:20:48] RustyTheCaster: We have the LCK schedule with 4 extra teams crammed in
[2:20:49] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: POGGERS
[2:20:54] janepatrick3323: Gen.G Ruler best ADC

[2:23:55] s0naut: @RUSTYTheCASTER yeah I understand that, i was just curious about casting side, even with many casters may not be as appealing knowing there is so many teams
[2:23:55] roll1ng1: or 60
[2:23:57] AoiiKitsune: @RUSTYTheCASTER will they all be in different cities or will some teams share? Also would the smaller teams get stadiums as well?
[2:24:01] Bunnything: @RUSTYTheCASTER ah my bad lol
[2:24:01] will_o_will: league is a game that supposed to fight
[2:24:03] RustyTheCaster: God honestly we'll need like 35 shoutcasters
[2:24:04] rCRlMSON: Every league should have b03 BibleThump
[2:24:14] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: This is how league is played. Fight over vision and everything. Always try to punish unlike LCK only want to scale until late game and dont play fast. LCK is so boring to watch compared to LPL and casters still make this league boring how is it possible BrokeBack
[2:24:18] RustyTheCaster: @AoiiKitsune We're already about to have teams sharing, JDG and RNG are both Beijing based
[2:24:18] FURIA_Chase: @RUSTYTheCASTER I nominate myself please :)

[2:24:51] FK_P: This is how league is played. Fight over vision and everything. Always try to punish unlike LCK only want to scale until late game and dont play fast. LCK is so boring to watch compared to LPL and casters still make this league boring how is it possible BrokeBack
[2:24:52] AoiiKitsune: Will JDG get their own stadium or share with RNG? @RUSTYTheCASTER
