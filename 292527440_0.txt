[1:04:54] RustyTheCaster: Usually the west has a favourite team but watches the days games, the LPL is designed like traditional sports where you only watch a team but can watch others

[2:07:18] s2kubi: better than Uzi
[2:07:20] dmzz: @RUSTYTheCASTER do most casters know how to speak chinese?
[2:07:20] s2kubi: no no =))
[2:07:26] Iscaf3: I think the reason the LPL isn’t that popular is because people aren’t familiar with the “drama” and history of the league so it’s less compelling to watch
[2:07:28] tolkienfanboi: Source? More like 480p LUL
[2:07:29] TronWeasley: 1-22
[2:07:32] RustyTheCaster: We are learning Chinese but no we don't know how yet

[2:07:45] Dbzfreak2: Chinese sounds fun to learn
[2:07:50] IM_GOING_GOBLIN_MODE: good luck learning chinese
[2:07:52] Dbzfreak2: Difficult but fun
[2:07:52] RustyTheCaster: It's really challenging to learn man

[2:08:07] dmzz: different tones mean different things
[2:08:10] RustyTheCaster: I can't understand people talking on the street at all even though I know some things
[2:08:11] ihavetofart0sis: @goblibguy01 They never crushed, when WE were at their best their did 3-2 against c9 at worlds. Now WE is doing super poorly, and I am very certain they would lose to FNC, MISFITS, G2, LIQUID might be 50/50 due to their inconsistency.
[2:08:13] goblinguy01: Fish and Clement know Mandarin :P
[2:08:21] FlyingBeluga: TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard
[2:08:24] Mad0strich: but Max is toiling away on a bottom tier team and ADCs always have a lot of hype, so maybe it's not surprising.
[2:08:27] Iscaf3: Chinese isn’t as hard as sugandese at least

[2:10:56] chosenchild2: OH SWAIM
[2:10:57] trisssmerigold: NA definitely has the best players, washed up trash Faker and SKT had to be saved by NA talents, while weak boy Uzi had to take rest every several games, for players currently playing, NA truly has the best of them across the whole world.
[2:11:06] nomoreterms: Tahm FailFish
[2:11:11] smolpotatofren: @goblibguy01 LPL just from numbers. If the question is which region is accessing their talent better? idk

[2:11:34] goblinguy01: @donkeykun It's not NA or EU
[2:11:35] Jumbalumba: Did they really change to 8.14 midweek?
[2:11:38] merthins: They only lost because LWX was pretty much afking and the LB pick making no sense in that rotation. @jainnatools If They draft better, they'll win,
[2:11:43] Clintmaia: GayPride
[2:11:51] immryr: EU by far the best region
[2:11:54] chosenchild2: OH GIMBOON ?
[2:11:57] 100t7777: Na talent is best But they play LOL for fun LUL
[2:12:01] smolpotatofren: @goblibguy01 Just from the numbers point. LPL has the shear AMOUNT of talent but getting that talent out of people is arguably more important
[2:12:02] goblinguy01: LWX has fallen :(.
[2:12:14] chosenchild2: FUN PLS
[2:12:16] goblinguy01: He should have been the next Chinese ADC

[2:49:36] FBHeron: I really love LCK and have followed it for years, but I think they're at their most equal to LPL with LPL having an ever so slight edge, there's just a lot of sloppiness and Griffin isn't necessarily experienced enough to perform at the highest level internationally
[2:49:38] Danition: How can FPX lose to freaking LGD xD

[2:52:28] RustyTheCaster: Let me frame it a different way, if you were here to watch the worst performing teams in a league
[2:52:29] ATLien26: Sad how LPL is best region but has the worst casters
[2:52:30] Mad0strich: Ori has used her ult for some pretty solid disengaged. she's played teamfights okay, she just lost lane really hard.

[2:53:32] ruC1: @RUSTYTheCASTER definitely high action EXCEPT if they fight just to fight, I don't like the fact that ryze went 1v4 under bottom inhib for instance
[2:53:32] milkTpapiAlt: kobe is so overrated
[2:53:34] FBHeron: Depends, I think 50 mins of nothing is fun if there's actually a good reason for it, if the teams are moving and counter-moving and it's inactive because they're equally matched I find that really fun, but if it's just inactive out of ZZZZZZZZZ....
