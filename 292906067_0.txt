[0:44:45] clockwork67: I would say TW is missing but its really just flash wolves xd
[0:44:48] dendruum: import allowed
[0:45:01] dendruum: aphro doublelift botlane, right?
[0:45:32] getyourcrayon0: a chill league chat? PogChamp
[0:45:38] dalittletiger02: @4fun_na_garbage_server wait so LCK still better than LPL
[0:45:40] dendruum: questionable
[0:45:43] PS110: hi
[0:45:47] stwstacer: viper VS uzi 0-11 PogChamp
[0:46:10] 100t7777: DL could understand what he say LUL
[0:46:13] hommega: still viper? ResidentSleeper
[0:46:15] dendruum: aphro has to play with cody man
[0:46:16] dendruum: too heavy
[0:46:26] PS110: yea man
[0:46:26] legoatmerchant: @dalittletiger02 i do believe korea is better but RNG is the only team better than korea
[0:46:30] getyourcrayon0: NaM ItsBoshyTime
[0:46:36] madiiiman: Best top lane in NA is Ssumday and it’s not even close tbh
[0:46:46] clockwork67: na dude KR aint better. griffin is good
[0:46:46] madiiiman: hes dumpstering literally everyone this split
[0:46:47] dendruum: korea is and will be the best region
[0:47:01] MarxVendetta: @4fun_na_garbage_server That does not make sense.. then Korea is not better LUL
[0:47:04] TechN9neBk: Ssumday isnt that good huni is better
[0:47:09] klown_with_a_k: did rng play yet
[0:47:18] legoatmerchant: alright then RNG>korea>CN
[0:47:18] dendruum: huni is the best toplaner imo
[0:47:22] legoatmerchant: hows that
[0:47:24] 100t7777: Rush time >Bio DL LUL
[0:47:25] dendruum: but he feels like he has to 1v9
[0:47:25] rocourttaken: ssumday > khan
[0:47:28] madiiiman: Yeah no ssumday is way better than huni atm
[0:47:33] rocourttaken: khan overrated
[0:47:37] brunohenq: porra é essa marreco

[0:48:03] madiiiman: i want to see Ssumday against smeb tbh. Ssumday at his peak in Korea was better than smeb was then. I want to see them head to head with both back in form
[0:48:24] dendruum: summy has 1 mvp in kr
[0:48:26] madiiiman: Impacts play style doesn’t lend to high stats. He absorbs absurd amounts of pressure
[0:48:26] legoatmerchant: Imagine NA innovating the meta before koreans and chinese LUL oh wait it never happened LUL
[0:48:27] rocourttaken: yeah impact either shows up big or is kinda irrelevant
[0:48:27] dendruum: thats big
[0:48:33] legoatmerchant: NA is just meta slave
[0:48:52] 100t7777: Impacts:NA TOP No IQ LUL
[0:48:52] TechN9neBk: @4fun_na_garbage_server quin bot lane
[0:49:02] Tylerfosho: 500 viewers monkaS
[0:49:03] klown_with_a_k: NA did bring the enchanter supports to MSI
[0:49:07] getyourcrayon0: NaM is meta slave as well
[0:49:07] dendruum: so we have doublelift, aphro, and summy, what about jungle and mid?
[0:49:10] klown_with_a_k: no one was playing them
[0:49:12] Tylerfosho: bria37 LOURLO? LUL
[0:49:16] madiiiman: Jungle dardoch
[0:49:33] rocourttaken: I’m a bit unsure about lourlo, he’s been a rock for ggs but he hasn’t really been fantastic
[0:49:38] TechN9neBk: @4fun_na_garbage_server also 99% of the builds ive seen in korea have been from b5 soloq months before being useed
[0:49:39] Tuomasi: lourlo LUL
[0:49:40] dendruum: I feel like dardoch has been "best" cuz he plays in a "winning team"
[0:49:42] Tylerfosho: Lourlo is garbo
[0:50:11] RNGRoyal: RNG Soon <3

[0:50:33] Cliqueatnightvandal: Wow cool matchups tonight

[0:52:09] legoatmerchant: Ray can finally prove himself with EDG instead of C9 LUL
[0:52:27] getyourcrayon0: love me long time SuperVinlin
[0:52:29] madiiiman: @failedhumanbeing look up 100t games from the week where Ssumday played jax and GP as his 2 picks. Most dominant week of all time for top lane in NA
[0:52:31] silenstorms: worst than pokimanes ori LUL
[0:52:32] 见钟情: ray is good
[0:52:34] 100t7777: JDG is CN KZ Zoom yagao PogChamp
[0:52:37] TechN9neBk: Ray was benched on c9 cuz impact was better at the time
[0:52:37] Moobot: He's back baby POGGERS
[0:53:14] Kxmx_Rin: @madiiiman Alright, will do^^
[0:53:14] TechN9neBk: when ray was on c9 top was tank meta ray only played carrys
[0:53:21] 100t7777: Ray Darius=Thal Darius=lose WutFace
[0:53:26] Tuomasi: pirean na time LUL pirean skt POGGERS
[0:53:48] madiiiman: I think Ssumday went either deathless or 1 death overall that week. 12/1 or 12/0 Jax and 5/0 GP
[0:53:48] legoatmerchant: its still kinda top tank meta with mundo and cho gath
[0:53:54] TechN9neBk: Pirean confirms na mid > faker though
[0:54:13] Cliqueatnightvandal: Honestly I think pirean got a bad rep in na p1 looked better with him playing imo
[0:54:16] dendruum: faker benched btw
[0:54:32] TechN9neBk: P1 held him back tbh
[0:54:35] dendruum: best midlaner in competive right now is BDD 100%
[0:54:48] madiiiman: I finally figured out the whole ViPER na talent meme. V1per in academy. Cuz viper is a rookie.
[0:54:53] madiiiman: Idk about Tarzan tho
[0:54:54] legoatmerchant: BDD LUL
[0:55:01] Tuomasi: NA is holding back players LUL
[0:55:02] 100t7777: I bet Faker will go to TOP in S9
[0:55:05] TechN9neBk: badd
[0:55:11] dendruum: chovy is 2nd
[0:55:11] legoatmerchant: griffin is the best korean team atm
[0:55:13] cr1msonaura: UCAL
[0:55:19] dendruum: but bdd is the best right now, no doubt.
[0:55:22] legoatmerchant: griffin and KT will make worlds
[0:55:23] daytraveler: chovy or xiaohu are the best
[0:55:24] madiiiman: @4fun_na_garbage_server no they arent
[0:55:24] cr1msonaura: UCAL is def one of the ebest ones
[0:55:28] Cliqueatnightvandal: Bdd is weird way of spelling doinb LUL
[0:55:31] TechN9neBk: best korean team is debatable

[6:08:38] illfightyourdad: let's go rw
[6:08:43] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Why is LCK so weak this year FeelsBadMan
[6:08:57] FK_P: lck is trash
[6:09:09] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: not a single super team this year in LCK FeelsBadMan
[6:09:27] Freshproducts: As an lpl fan, i still think lck have more depth than lpl
[6:09:28] 我艹: LCK ResidentSleeper
[6:09:33] arci59: rly? Moyu this chineese idiot plays for Marin?
[6:09:36] Freshproducts: and griffin might be stronger than rng
[6:09:50] bliblimylove: yeah agree
[6:10:04] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: WE last place in LPL could take a game from geng at last worlds. DogFace
[6:10:09] bliblimylove: but lets see what will happen in worlds
[6:10:12] bliblimylove: Xd
[6:10:49] Freshproducts: Rng the only standout macro team in lpl with good players
[6:11:00] Freshproducts: ig have good latent potential but shitty coaching staff
[6:11:00] moscow5up: @SC2Freshproducts so...why GRF not go to MSI?
[6:11:04] FK_P: what's hyperplay? what's going on in riotgames2 channel?
[6:11:09] Freshproducts: but i see potential in jdg
[6:11:18] Freshproducts: grf werent in spring split
[6:11:32] Laphx: why was that message being checked by automod
[6:11:38] Laphx: @moscow5up griffin weren't in the lck, they were promoted into lck summer
[6:11:38] Laphx: ???
[6:11:49] moscow5up: aha...so GRF<RNG
[6:11:57] zeckky1: KappaHD
[6:11:58] Laphx: rng are better yeah
[6:12:06] FK_P: I don't think IG macro is bad like people say
[6:12:08] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: RW stomped KZ the best LCK team, IG are wayy stronger than before RNG alone can beat any LCK team easily and Snake gave RNG an hard fight. This just tells you the competition of LPL.
[6:12:09] Freshproducts: I mean just from observing their games grf look strong
[6:12:11] FK_P: they just like to play really fast
[6:12:15] moscow5up: RNG are spring CHAP
[6:12:31] Laphx: griffin too inexperienced and unproven to say they're better than the team that just won msi
[6:12:35] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: IG macro is insane
[6:12:35] Leroyvan: who will win first 5 kills?
[6:12:37] moscow5up: GRF is who????
[6:12:44] Freshproducts: I said might be better
[6:12:51] Laphx: let griffin prove it internationally, but until then, rng > grf
[6:13:06] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: will grf make worlds? DogFace
[6:13:25] moscow5up: GRF=LPL SS
[6:13:40] Freshproducts: Besides rng, i dont know if theres any good lpl team that can challenge kr’s top 3
[6:13:43] FK_P: lol
[6:13:47] Freshproducts: Jdg unproven
[6:13:50] bliblimylove: i hope jdg can go worlds this season
[6:13:55] Freshproducts: and rw beat a declining kz
[6:13:56] Kakoolha: It's really even
[6:14:10] Freshproducts: Jdg have shown really good early game and macro
[6:14:12] bliblimylove: jdg ig rw rng XD
[6:14:21] Freshproducts: amd yagao actually is a good chinese mid
[6:14:32] moscow5up: @bliblimylove chinese dont want....
[6:14:42] axelzidane: who will win f5k?
[6:14:55] axelzidane: SNG?
[6:14:57] Kakoolha: There's like 3 or 4 unproven teams that could qualify from KR/CN
[6:14:59] bliblimylove: @moscow5up dont want what
[6:15:07] FK_P: I think suning will win
[6:15:13] moscow5up: chinese hope IG RNG RW go this season
[6:15:18] Laphx: @Kakoolha you mean to go to worlds?
[6:15:21] moscow5up: i think
[6:15:23] Freshproducts: The only thing that sucks is that rw or jdg are staying in CN
[6:15:28] Freshproducts: amd not going to worlds
[6:15:36] Freshproducts: unless iG combust in playoffs agn
[6:15:39] moscow5up: also i hope DansGame
[6:15:50] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: mods check my message DansGame
[6:15:54] Kakoolha: @iammeni Having a decent chance
[6:15:59] FK_P: IG and RNG need to go together
[6:16:11] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: RW destroyed KZ easily and RW are wayyyy better now. IG are so strong atm. EDG beat LCK teams. RNG easily beats any LCK team. LCK still didn't win a single tournament this year.
[6:16:25] 国人晓迪: DansGame
[6:16:30] bliblimylove: ah kinda @moscow5up as jdg dont have much experience maybe
[6:16:40] bliblimylove: doesnt*
[6:16:45] Freshproducts: IG are strong in China, but their style gets countered by KR
[6:16:56] Freshproducts: Edg have weak macro compared to lck
[6:17:07] redmiss69: Самая страшная девушка твича подрубила, залетаем ко мне
[6:17:13] Laphx: ya kt, ig, rw, kz, afs, edg, grf, jdg, all unproven internationally with good chance to go to worlds
[6:17:15] Laphx: 8 teams
[6:17:17] Edi119: Is this live ?
[6:17:24] Freshproducts: like iG lane kingdom gets fked by kr teams that turtle well
[6:17:26] moscow5up: @bliblimylove JDG is upstar
[6:17:27] CallsignBA: ya
[6:17:37] CallsignBA: But i think RW is actually stronger then IG
[6:17:49] Freshproducts: Ya JDG have korean esque macro with good mechanical players
[6:18:02] SnailSama: edg lul
[6:18:06] Freshproducts: their recent match was pretty clinical when they got ahead
[6:18:09] bliblimylove: and with hommie
[6:18:10] Laphx: im tempted to agree, esp because rw always has crazy shit that will throw off other teams, and without week 2 at worlds now in groups, there will be less time to prepare and adapt
[6:18:18] bliblimylove: he is really so good
