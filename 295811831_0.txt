[2:57:52] RustyTheCaster: but if I were to foresee any roster shifts it would be iBoy or Meiko
[2:58:07] RustyTheCaster: EDG are suffering from the same problem as WE
[2:58:26] lansquid: but is meiko performance that bad??
[2:58:28] yaaz000: EDIIIIGGGGG will wrap this one

[3:00:41] RustyTheCaster: Great question
[3:00:45] badonkaboots5: SourPls
[3:00:56] RustyTheCaster: Not the slightest idea given that they change rosters so much. Maybe Xiye?
[3:00:56] lansquid: i dont think i ve ever learnt that from anywhere
[3:01:06] RustyTheCaster: He's the only consistent that isn't a top laner
[3:01:41] lansquid: i agree with that, but shot calling?... isn't that evident who thats rly from
[3:01:56] RustyTheCaster: It isn't to me because again, junglers swapping and rookie supports coming in constantly
[3:02:06] RustyTheCaster: It has to be Xiye
