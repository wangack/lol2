[4:34:07] lovenishimiya: @trus5 @lansquid always have faith in RNG, dont know why, they always have a low time and bounces back very strongly.. just like spring split and MSI
[4:34:29] trus5: @lovenishimiya they was almost undefeated with Uzi in spring
[4:34:51] lansquid: oh i have faith, but its just a bit like 'ok when will these hiccups end?' '*hic*'
[4:35:35] lovenishimiya: @trus5 actually in spring, able played most of the split, when Uzi came back they needed time to adapt with Uzi again.. and then onwards it was uphill performance
[4:36:16] lovenishimiya: @trus5 In MSI, RNG started off really badly 2-3 at one point during group stages, but then goes on a winning spree
[4:36:59] lansquid: i will say one thing tho, the patches are coming in marksman players favor, so theoretically uzi should have a smoother recovery this time
[4:37:18] lovenishimiya: @trus5 that is why, before playoffs seeing RNG struggling is actually better, it means they will have time to correct those mistake and get the momentum going
