[3:30:29] Darkheart711: idk man this meta is kinda hard to read
[3:30:44] itscoldbolt: WE can't deal with the poke which will come late game.
[3:30:47] chosenchild2: hahahaha
[3:30:49] Rioseblade: Rito should kick CLG out of LCS and allow IMT or NV to join back POGGERS

[3:31:52] Darkheart711: comet on aatrox is just overall better damage
[3:31:59] itscoldbolt: They aren't going to win in 15 mins. They don't have enough lane clear apart from bot and that depends on mid and jungler ganking bot. But FPX has GP.

[3:45:42] itscoldbolt: apprently someone has put on 2k on this bet to win 4k
[3:45:43] empiil: fpx win 2-1 EZ
[3:45:48] 西大韦神: so why you are not playing pro?
[3:45:52] ttsfinaki: @Gunerdrag 4Head
[3:45:53] IntriguingNA: As an alistar main at a respectably high elo, this game is hard to watch. Literally cringing at some of these mistakes. If you actually want to learn alistar PM me (im silver 3 24lp) I also do coaching SeriousSloth 1
[3:45:58] seeng: wtf why i bet this match gg
[3:46:02] Gunerdrag: ez $3 thx for coffee WE 4Head .
[3:46:06] itscoldbolt: it's not the comp at all which is the issue. It's how they're executing it
[3:46:07] roll1ng1: i bet on WE after draft.. Atroxx = EZ money LUL
[3:46:08] iloveiuoov: Already lose ban page FPX
[3:46:15] seeng: i thought fpx is good hays
[3:46:16] galaus: @PiusDominatus they pushed these laws after a mafia/money laundering scandal: standard move LUL

[3:47:00] mandamcgee: $4k
[3:47:09] PiusDominatus: @galaus Ah IC
[3:47:15] Gunerdrag: @RUSTYTheCASTER is Fish officially back? PogChamp
[3:47:16] Boey420: fpx dragging but not trying LUL
[3:47:18] itscoldbolt: @BarelyOtaku That's why they play to range and ward behhind but they aren't even doing that. They are making the fights outside of their win condidtions via by not poking first
[3:47:19] window7player: write an essay how u win a lane in lol
[3:47:28] RustyTheCaster: Fish left riot not the LPL ;)
[3:47:40] FlipperMeTimbers: gg
[3:47:42] BarelyOtaku: @itscoldbolt You can't ward behind or go into the jungle when all your lanes are losing
[3:47:47] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I think 2018 will be TSM's year, great roster change from overaggresive doublelift to toned, solid Zven should lead them to another easy NA LCS title and then marvellous performance at worlds, i honestly believe bjerg with grig can carry this, with little help from the best native NA top atm hauntzer, and best western support mithy, this should be a good year for TSM.
