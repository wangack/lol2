[1:39:03] Laphx: were you expecting him to
[1:39:15] Laphx: :)
[1:39:15] 1726223611: 。。
[1:40:21] wale_lol: LPL needs to improve their stream quality. It says 1080p but if you put it side-by-side with LCK u can see the resolution is worse and the colors are less vibrant
[1:40:31] Laphx: he forgot about shen LUL
[1:40:34] yutana97: LUL
[1:40:45] lazintozzz: wp
[1:40:56] Laphx: even on swain lwx finds a way
[1:41:27] darkblade83: @zoomenhanced somehow i miss tank rooCry
[1:44:35] darkblade83: @zoomenhanced ikr at least when he locked in a champ we know what to expect
[1:45:57] lazintozzz: leblanc target selection was rubbih
[1:46:29] Laphx: this one is pretty over
[1:46:34] LaoWai42: @darkblade83 i mean guoguo in the long run is a better choice though
[1:46:46] 国人晓迪: LUL
[1:46:59] LaoWai42: he just needs some time to develop he is so young
[1:47:02] SkYzZ99: How could the odds be so good on fpx? They are fucking snake
[1:47:41] wale_lol: bet on them for map 2 then if you're sure :^)
[1:48:03] darkblade83: @Laowai42 guoguos skill ceiling is low tbh
[1:48:07] SkYzZ99: Is this bo3?
[1:48:12] Laphx: yes bo3
[1:48:14] wale_lol: yes
[1:48:19] LaoWai42: ya but your just trying to get a pobelter equivalent
[1:48:28] LaoWai42: can hold his lane knows how to play passive
[1:48:29] SkYzZ99: oh so i didnt loose my bet just now? XD
[1:48:43] wale_lol: lol
[1:49:01] LaoWai42: cause they need to build around flandre, sofm, light imo
[1:49:03] lazintozzz: snake has 2 weeks to prepare and this is what happens? lol
[1:49:11] dEMONELL: Noob play
[1:49:38] LaoWai42: no i'm saying pobelter's level is something i think guoguo can get to and he has a more passive playstyle which is what snake needs
[1:50:21] SkYzZ99: gg'
[1:50:22] eltriani: welp
[1:50:22] GoldSolitude: viewbot count today?

[1:51:15] s0naut: Oh thank god, i bet on omg v snake, not fpx v snake LUL
[1:51:20] LaoWai42: @zoomenhanced I don't think he is there yet i think he needs a couple of splits, but he picked up leblanc just for the counter pick
[1:51:21] oukenXD: five five kai
[1:51:26] GoldSolitude: 8.8k
[1:51:34] GoldSolitude: thats not a link
[1:51:37] LaoWai42: he has had good games on it last split
[1:51:38] SkYzZ99: its bo3 @s0naut
[1:52:06] LaoWai42: true
[1:52:09] s0naut: @SkYzZ99 to 2-0 on omg, also just realized i need snake to win in total aswell
[1:52:28] oukenXD: have dinner
[1:52:34] s0naut: got my bets mixed up LUL
[1:53:05] LaoWai42: but guoguo definitely is not where he needs to be if snake want to compete in playoffs
[1:53:12] LaoWai42: i just think they need to have a longer term view
[1:54:20] LaoWai42: @zoomenhanced its almost impossible to say any team shouldnt take knight, but i think they would need to drop sofm
[1:54:33] LaoWai42: cause knight/sofm won't work
[1:54:52] LaoWai42: but knight flandre sounds legit
[1:55:04] wale_lol: i think esports teaams should start approaching players like sports teams. the worst choice you can make is buying good players but still not being a top team. either go all in or rebuild with young talent
[1:55:35] LaoWai42: pawn would work well for snake
[1:56:58] LaoWai42: hmm he is a franchise player for snake i would be surprised
[1:58:41] LaoWai42: i'm sure he would get other offers
[1:59:08] LaoWai42: but i don't know how many other orgs would be willing to build a team around him
[1:59:26] LaoWai42: he won't get as much freedom as he does on snake
[2:00:07] LaoWai42: no way why would you that would be a massive pay cut
[2:00:31] LaoWai42: it would be career suicide imo
[2:01:19] LaoWai42: almost immediately he would fade into obscurity unless he gets the one worlds spot and pops of
[2:01:32] LaoWai42: *off
[2:02:34] LaoWai42: if i were his agent i would plant my flag at snake and start pandoring to the ChongQing fans
[2:03:03] eltriani: fpx
[2:03:10] darkblade83: @zoomenhanced can you pm me that fb
[2:03:13] LaoWai42: they haven't been around long enough to have legacy names like omg's gogoing royal's tabe etc

[2:14:17] LaoWai42: i dunno though i think trundle is a good pick for sofm

[2:21:29] billyyyim: SS 2-1
[2:21:33] crazyjoedavola2: FPX has the better late, but SS might snowball
[2:21:49] lazintozzz: why did they make dragons rng? there is already enough rng in the game with rits..
[2:22:10] Laphx: casters aren't atrocious and the viewership is low because lck playoffs are on, plus the lpl just isn't as popular in the west
[2:22:31] darksmoke91: @Speedern u think so ? ss has vlad and ez aswell both teams have good late, but i give u that, lb isnt that much usefull then zoe
[2:22:39] crazyjoedavola2: lpl isnt as popular because the product is shit
[2:22:43] crazyjoedavola2: due to casters
[2:22:52] Laphx: fpx are gonna be really squishy im worried for their late game
[2:23:41] Laphx: this game is prob just gonna snowball really fast regardless and won't go late to matter
[2:24:56] 国人晓迪: EleGiggle 4Head
