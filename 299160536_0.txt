[0:07:59] morschabi: JackeyLove Alistar, Rakan
[0:08:45] KaizerBox: wxz PogChamp
[0:08:55] KaizerBox: one rich boi
[0:09:10] morschabi: WXZ is the new starter, West is his sub, JackeyLove is Support lol
[0:09:42] koleston: WXZ is the owner monkaS
[0:09:44] KaizerBox: wait JL support? why? baolan maina support..
[0:09:45] dajoubudota: When you're so rich you just buy a starting spot
[0:09:51] 我来了哈哈: 王校长
[0:09:57] 我来了哈哈: B)
[0:09:59] morschabi: Baolan's benched for JackeyLove.
[0:10:22] koleston: its just like reginald in s3 xd
[0:10:33] KaizerBox: VG is probably scared of winning, cause wxz will loose face..
[0:10:52] morschabi: JackeyLove will play Alistar and Rakan
[0:11:57] haosler: fucking rich boy
[0:11:59] dajoubudota: Vg is so bad that WXZ could literally run it down mid and RooKie wold still carry
[0:12:32] KaizerBox: probably not, its gonna be 6v4
[0:13:09] rlas123: WXZ
[0:13:33] morschabi: Unfortunately WXZ can play LoL
[0:13:34] KaizerBox: they have to put the spot light on him, they probably dont want to out perform him
[0:13:57] dajoubudota: @haiku_l I don't think you know how bad VG is
[0:14:03] FK_P: isn't that guy multi billionaire
[0:14:37] morschabi: His father is the second rich man in China but yeah he's rich too.
[0:14:41] miracle_sha: wtf SwiftRage
[0:14:43] turobben: Exactly.
[0:14:43] KaizerBox: @dajoubudota I still believe, like I did with WE.
[0:15:51] dajoubudota: WE has issuse but they have the players to win, Vg is so bad they might get kicked out of the league
[0:16:02] morschabi: WXZ is the owner of iG, PandaTV and Banana Culture Entertainment.
[0:16:22] FK_P: the worst part is that Vici Gaming can't be good regardless of their lineup
[0:16:27] ElimMusk: can vici one game? o_o
[0:16:29] dajoubudota: He also is sitting on the board of Wanda, his fathers comany
[0:16:36] ElimMusk: can vici take*
[0:16:57] FK_P: they have coco, easyhoon, swift
[0:17:26] KaizerBox: Ez win for VG BlessRNG
[0:17:39] morschabi: Rookie will carry
[0:18:06] dajoubudota: Also WXZ is good on ezreal and is around master's level so it' not like he is gold 5 or something, IG's topside will carry them trough
[0:18:43] morschabi: JackeyLove's Alistar and Rakan are good.
[0:18:46] KaizerBox: i thought that was only a roumor that hes master
[0:19:28] FK_P: why not Baolan NotLikeThis
[0:19:33] dajoubudota: He has an account in masters but hasn't played on it this season, most people assume he is between d5 and masters in skill
[0:19:36] xzragexz: is this his first game playing?
[0:19:48] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: Is WXZ the new guy?
[0:19:50] Schleopard: WXZ POGGERS
[0:19:52] morschabi: Because JackeyLove is ADC

[0:20:06] Zyniao: wxz is the owner of ig
[0:20:16] FK_P: so he wants jackeylove to give him tips ingame?
[0:20:18] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: This is so troll
[0:20:18] stop753: WXZ PogChamp
[0:20:22] morschabi: Baolan is too good to be WXZ's Support
[0:20:23] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: they might still win tho
[0:20:23] Zyniao: ya rich boy
[0:20:24] stop753: IG boss
[0:20:27] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: vg is that bad
[0:20:35] Schleopard: WXZ Dad is 3rd richest dude in China

[0:21:29] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: Is Vici gonna get relegated
[0:21:31] haosler: 루키야 힘내라
[0:21:33] dajoubudota: WXZ is the team owner and subbed himself in because 1. Vg is trash and will lose even in a 5v4
[0:21:34] NoTearCN: 王思聪来干嘛？？？
[0:21:35] dajoubudota: 2. IG is guaranteed first place unless they drop every single upcoming game (0% chance to happen)
[0:21:38] xzragexz: i wanna see the casters take on this
[0:21:51] Zyniao: its like trump's son wanna play lol, so they paid C9 a million.
[0:21:52] morschabi: Not subbed lol He's the new starter.

[0:24:47] yyffan666: JKL Support
[0:24:52] ReWriters: WXZ AD. the normal AD went to support
[0:25:08] SkepticID: the boss said "没有什么是钱解决不了的", meaning "there's nothing that money can't solve" LUL
[0:25:11] morschabi: WXZ is master
[0:25:12] 蓮見さん最高よ0000: Wait does his dad own IG or does he own IG
[0:25:28] morschabi: He owns IG
[0:25:30] thedrfaust: He
[0:25:34] dajoubudota: @dragonberg85 WXZ is the legendary player that solokilled Faker 3 times in lane, he just came out of retirement to make ure IG wins worlds
[0:25:34] FK_P: what's the difference
[0:25:34] ReWriters: JKL I remember was also challenger support in Korea server as well.
[0:25:34] yyffan666: WXZ AD JKL SUP baolan SUB
[0:25:52] dragonberg85: damn hope he is good
[0:26:13] morschabi: WXZ starter ADC, West Supp, JKL Supp, Baolan sub Supp
[0:26:18] dragonberg85: so who is playing bot lane for IG?
[0:26:19] ky0u4568: he is not hes actually plat, but its vg so they would still win
[0:26:27] dragonberg85: jackeylove and WXZ?
[0:26:29] morschabi: West sub*
[0:26:30] ky0u4568: wxz adc and jackeylove supp
[0:26:31] yyffan666: WXZ have Diamond2
[0:26:41] dajoubudota: @dragonberg85 He is tash, however Vg will lose to 5 bonobo's so don't worry, IG's topside will carry hard enough even if their botlae goes 0-10
[0:26:43] imCylo: Can someone explain what's going on
[0:26:53] ky0u4568: because the entire ig is kr challenger, not that hard to boost someone to d2
[0:27:01] FK_P: so rich that you can pay to get boosted to LPL LUL
[0:27:09] dragonberg85: is swift playing for VG?
[0:27:13] morschabi: WXZ owns IG and wants to play on the stage.
[0:27:14] xzragexz: money talks
[0:27:21] Schleopard: wxz owns IG and subbed himself in for adc
[0:27:28] imCylo: ?????
[0:27:28] ReWriters: WXZ real skill level is about middle diamond
[0:27:30] SkepticID: WXZ ADC. TheShy, Ning, Rookie and Baolan, al 4 playing Support for WXZ
[0:27:43] morschabi: He's the new starter, not sub lol It's his team
[0:27:44] dragonberg85: LMFAO
[0:27:47] dragonberg85: LUL
[0:27:53] imCylo: This doesn't affect standings though right
[0:27:54] SkepticID: its legit gonna be so funny
[0:27:59] dajoubudota: @imCylo Ig is guaranteedfirst place, Vg is the worst team in the LPL so their owner is playing adc for fun, Vg will lose even in a 5v4 because they are THAT bad
[0:28:02] SkepticID: @imCylo could affect
[0:28:07] ky0u4568: it doesnt they already secured 1st spot
[0:28:13] morschabi: Poor JackeyLove
[0:28:22] imCylo: Lmao
[0:28:22] SkepticID: IG isnt guranteed first actually, but most likely will be first place
[0:28:25] dajoubudota: Ig has to lose every single game to not get 1s place
[0:28:25] FK_P: can't JDG tie with them?
[0:28:26] ReWriters: repeart the lesson of rich people can do anything they wanted :)
[0:28:31] noobie9999: jackeylove play sup, not baolan

[0:28:50] ky0u4568: @SkepticID do you really understand how lpl works? RW is in west it wont matter if they are 20-0
[0:29:01] morschabi: Baolan is sub Support until WXZ gives up
[0:29:07] imCylo: I haven't seen lpl really. I tuned in after seeing raz's tweet
[0:29:10] Tarkisan: The owner from IG is going to play?

[8:40:48] AlmightAza: NA does the thing china used to do, but 10x worse, where when they get into an international event, they completely change their strategies and overthink the meta and end up not playing their own game and sucking
