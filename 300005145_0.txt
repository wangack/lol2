[2:27:04] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: @satatardy LCK doesn't look as strong as s4,s5. They were much better before. Theres a lot of weaker teams in LCK nowadays and the top tier teams aren't that dominant.

[5:01:26] fatalqwerty: @Spisepinden the difference in LoL and Dota2 is that in Dota2 you have to be in the higher echelons to make bank, while in League the bottom tier shitters are more taken cared for. Some people might disagree with how the money is distributed but at least in League the bottom teams actually get paid.
[5:02:21] SpookyFenCh: @fatalqwerty xD gotcha. I think it probably creates a more even playing field = better competitive scene when players are all getting paid properly
[5:02:26] fatalqwerty: @Spisepinden I dont know how contracts work in SEA, they posted it anyway.
[5:02:33] umami_g_n: unless you are in a wildcard region
[5:03:08] grecop: WHO won?
[5:03:28] fatalqwerty: @Spisepinden that's my only gripe with the way money is distributed in Dota, it's always gonna be the same players playing the game if there's no opporutnity for startup teams to go (since they can't afford to spend as much time compared to well-off teams).
