[2:09:56] belacqua_: Hauntzer nails it all the time. You instantly realize why he’s the best top player in NA. His plays just give me chills everytime I watch. The jungler’s movement is also impeccable, making me wonder how the coach makes a call for his move.
[2:09:57] 一生为回眸一笑: TSM is honestly on the same level as SKT right now

[2:10:35] belacqua_: Bjergsen is by far the best without a doubt. Zven is also excellent in teamfights, and I’ve been watching Grig since before he joined the team, and he has improved so much.
