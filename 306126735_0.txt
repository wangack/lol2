[0:05:52] xiao404: SwiftRage
[0:06:51] Cneezy2869: Why does it say1-0 did they play a game already
[0:06:53] Lushington1: pre show half hr before
[0:06:54] RustyTheCaster: All of the games are in Beijing so games are starting earlier
[0:07:04] RustyTheCaster: it's a weighted best of 5 due to standings finish
[0:07:05] DataDoctress: The countdown quality looks better than anything else
[0:07:17] Cneezy2869: ah ok gotcha
[0:07:28] andrealuvs: lol
[0:07:33] godshoan: lol
[0:07:52] Cneezy2869: LPL structure so confusing sometimes lol
[0:08:23] RustyTheCaster: Yeah, I mean it's not too abd once you learn it
[0:08:33] DataDoctress: wait, whats a weighted best of 5?
[0:08:34] RustyTheCaster: we this is 4th vs 3rd, and 3rd needs some kind of advantage
[0:08:40] RustyTheCaster: so 3rd starts 1-0 up
[0:08:41] J2easoN: loool lpl can buy wins in playoffs? pay to win XDDD
[0:08:46] DataDoctress: oh
[0:09:02] J2easoN: how much did top pay to get win?
[0:09:13] J2easoN: they could just pay suning to soft int no?
[0:09:16] RustyTheCaster: I mean they bought MaRin
[0:09:19] Seenarius: Is it bo3 or bo5 guys?
[0:09:20] CrowCity: @RUSTYTheCASTER when do you think they will do BO7's?
[0:09:27] RustyTheCaster: I don't think they will do bo7's
[0:09:31] xxxxdbxxxx: BO5 for sure
[0:09:32] RustyTheCaster: that's too much gaming in a row
[0:09:37] CrowCity: rofl

[0:09:49] CrowCity: How are you my dude
[0:09:54] RustyTheCaster: if the current format of the LPL continues into next year when we had 2 more teams
[0:09:54] DataDoctress: 1st vs 4th they need bo7 cause 1st will start 3:0 that way
[0:09:59] RustyTheCaster: every single day will be a 3 set bo3
[0:10:05] RustyTheCaster: the last thing we need is more games
[0:10:15] tigersareyellow: why does it say 1-0? does the higher seed get an automatic game?
[0:10:22] Cneezy2869: how could u not want more games of awesome

[0:15:23] twitch1118: wow
[0:15:36] Cneezy2869: @rustythecaster why u guys stay behind on patches so long compared to everyone else
[0:15:36] twitch1118: POGGERS
[0:15:52] RustyTheCaster: The LPL when it comes to patching is behind because the live server in China patches 2 weeks late
[0:16:14] RustyTheCaster: AFAIK the government has to check each patch for approval or something like that
[0:16:15] CrowCity: that i did not know about that
[0:16:25] CrowCity: a history lesson form Rusty
[0:16:29] CrowCity: good to know
[0:16:41] RustyTheCaster: So when you all patch I just sit there and watch streams for like.. an entire week to learn what's strong
[0:17:16] trapaholics: Never forget how free we are in NA KKona
[0:17:26] CrowCity: @RUSTYTheCASTER do you know what I want to happen in 8.19?

[0:17:54] Cneezy2869: doesn't it make it hard to practice for international when the patch u will play on is ahead of what urmusi g regionaly

[0:18:55] Gunerdrag: i agree. i kind of miss the old metas
[0:18:59] CrowCity: Actually, i take that back, how about an ADC Role Buff? That needs a fix
[0:19:02] RustyTheCaster: @Cneezy2869 absolutely it does, but the LPL pro's had Korea to practice on, dunno if they still do
[0:19:03] Cneezy2869: I want the game to get to a point where every champ is meta, so many games of same picks, gets old
[0:19:28] RustyTheCaster: ADC's are running rampant thanks to 8.16
[0:19:41] RustyTheCaster: you know what I want back? The actually good adc items

[0:23:29] swampy_sloth: Ya that’s the worst part FeelsBadMan
[0:23:40] rubenrayez: higher seed should just get side selection or more bans. 1 game is too big advantage
[0:23:44] swampy_sloth: They def do
[0:23:54] CrowCity: @dm_tophat the only team that has a high chance of winning is Invictus Gaming
[0:24:08] swampy_sloth: More bans seems more broken than an extra win iko
[0:24:11] swampy_sloth: Imo*
[0:24:16] Gunerdrag: don't forget rng lol

[1:19:42] FK_P: Because it's a gauntlet format there is a clear difference between number 1 and number 2. But with the first match being number 3 vs number 4, there would be no difference between placing 3rd or 4th in the regular season without the weightened bo5.

But as the first match needs to be 3rd vs 4th, giving the higher seed a game advantage is a way to differentiate them.
