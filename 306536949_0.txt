[0:25:16] deags_ce: Faker doesn't have much longer until he has to do his mandatory service
[0:25:25] call_me_peewee: Guy is the G.O.A.T.
[0:25:27] deags_ce: so he can't stay pro for more than 3 more years iirc
[0:25:33] Casen_Point: Also, a Korean exsodius is extremely unlikely considering that China has been improving drasticly recently
[0:25:35] defilerz: OMG cool FeelsBadMan
[0:25:56] goblinguy01: OMG Gogoing Kreygasm

[0:26:43] goblinguy01: Deft, Mata and Pawn still play like it's the LPL
[0:27:08] deags_ce: A a lot of Kpop guys had to retire recently to do their mandatory service when they all turned 26
[0:27:08] goblinguy01: Deft roams and dies randomly just like in EDG
[0:27:33] Casen_Point: That's the KT special
[0:27:47] Casen_Point: It's like CLG but it works a lot more often apparently FeelsBadMan

[0:28:29] deags_ce: Hey man at least League doesn't kill their players like American Football does, as much as I love that, too
[0:28:34] goblinguy01: Even Peanut, Faker and Samsung bot lane wanted to take another title away from Score
[0:28:45] goblinguy01: Score - Forever second
[0:29:04] deags_ce: Griffin can't adapt to outside Korea metas
[0:29:05] goblinguy01: Score loses a game, and peanut feeds in two
[0:29:12] deags_ce: at least i'm pretty sure they won't be able to
[0:29:26] goblinguy01: Griffin will make it out of groups
[0:29:30] Casen_Point: They went from mages to ADC rather seemlessly
[0:29:37] goblinguy01: Too ez
[0:29:58] goblinguy01: This show is hilarious
[0:30:12] deags_ce: I love that China has adopted so many of the Japanese variety style television shows
[0:30:27] deags_ce: with all the ACME sound effects to go with it
[0:30:35] Casen_Point: Now if JPN was good at lol
[0:30:43] deags_ce: IF ONLY MAN
[0:31:02] deags_ce: They were f***ed for so long because of Japanese gambling laws were so broad players couldn't be payed directly for competing.
[0:31:14] goblinguy01: Pig = Sej Mandarin?
[0:31:16] deags_ce: It was considered a form of gambling
[0:31:25] Casen_Point: Isn't it still?
[0:31:45] call_me_peewee: Were gonna have english commentators right?

[2:47:46] FK_P: Griffin is not good
[2:47:47] belacqua_: I thought casters prefer to stand up because its helps their speech
[2:47:51] PapaSmithy: helps you project better, especially beneficial for newer casters
[2:47:56] belacqua_: and bodylanguage
[2:47:59] RustyTheCaster: I defintiely stand whenever I'm casting the game
[2:48:04] belacqua_: ayy Papa laying ti down

[2:56:11] RuneBattleaxeXD: TBH, I'm quite sure 100T would be able to beat Invictus Gaming, with how well Ssumday and Rikara are playing. There's no doubt in my mind. No doubt when you also consider AnDa and his macro-prowess

[2:58:15] ÍµøÏï†ÌîÑÌÑ∞Îàà: KT vs GRF odds : 1.6 vs 2.2
[2:58:15] RuneBattleaxeXD: look, be REALISTIC. Uzi is good, yes, but Rikara is playing against the BEST in the West. Uzi on his BEST day cannot compete with Rikara. Rikara has been moulded by Aphromoo, one of the greatest bot-lane minds in League history
[2:58:23] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: C9 would beat griffin actually but only in a Bo5. I think griffin players champ pool is not good enough for Bo5 and thats their weakness and C9 loves to play 1-3-1 comps and are really good at that. Their macro is pretty good for a western team.
[2:58:27] janepatrick3323: can chinese people access Twitch ?
