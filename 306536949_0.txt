[0:25:25] call_me_peewee: Guy is the G.O.A.T.
[0:25:27] deags_ce: so he can't stay pro for more than 3 more years iirc
[0:25:33] Casen_Point: Also, a Korean exsodius is extremely unlikely considering that China has been improving drasticly recently
[0:25:35] defilerz: OMG cool FeelsBadMan

[0:27:08] deags_ce: A a lot of Kpop guys had to retire recently to do their mandatory service when they all turned 26

[0:28:29] deags_ce: Hey man at least League doesn't kill their players like American Football does, as much as I love that, too
[0:28:34] goblinguy01: Even Peanut, Faker and Samsung bot lane wanted to take another title away from Score
[0:28:45] goblinguy01: Score - Forever second
[0:29:04] deags_ce: Griffin can't adapt to outside Korea metas
[0:29:05] goblinguy01: Score loses a game, and peanut feeds in two
[0:29:12] deags_ce: at least i'm pretty sure they won't be able to
[0:29:26] goblinguy01: Griffin will make it out of groups
[0:29:30] Casen_Point: They went from mages to ADC rather seemlessly
[0:29:37] goblinguy01: Too ez

[0:30:35] Casen_Point: Now if JPN was good at lol
[0:30:43] deags_ce: IF ONLY MAN
[0:31:02] deags_ce: They were f***ed for so long because of Japanese gambling laws were so broad players couldn't be payed directly for competing.
[0:31:14] goblinguy01: Pig = Sej Mandarin?
[0:31:16] deags_ce: It was considered a form of gambling
[0:31:25] Casen_Point: Isn't it still?

[2:55:56] FK_P: Griffin is the most OVERRATED team of all times
[2:56:09] imCylo: Griffin isn't underrated anymore is it
[2:56:11] RuneBattleaxeXD: TBH, I'm quite sure 100T would be able to beat Invictus Gaming, with how well Ssumday and Rikara are playing. There's no doubt in my mind. No doubt when you also consider AnDa and his macro-prowess
[2:56:17] KnifeWife1: KappaPride COOL
[2:56:19] janepatrick3323: i love Ambition and Corejj

[2:56:41] silverpanther19: who gonna win dis game?
[2:56:43] PkProd07: Woox soloed ToB PogChamp
[2:56:51] FK_P: Invictus Gaming would destroy Griffin
[2:56:54] ompalompa1997: JDG
[2:56:56] ompalompa1997: will win this one
[2:57:03] xcreatiiik: i dont like anda on 100thieves
[2:57:04] Riki_lol: BUT RNG WILL BEAT IG LUL
[2:57:07] janepatrick3323: which team is doing well in NA??? TL still???
[2:57:07] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Invictus Gaming would destroy Griffin
[2:57:10] ompalompa1997: i have 600 dollars on jdg
[2:57:12] RuneBattleaxeXD: TBH, I'm quite sure 100T would be able to beat Invictus Gaming, with how well Ssumday and Rikara are playing. There's no doubt in my mind. No doubt when you also consider Aphromoo and his macro-prowess

[2:58:00] ezreal6218: PogChamp
[2:58:02] KnifeWife1: @fatalqwerty probably not, but i'd say around 75% of Uzi's
[2:58:15] 굿애프터눈: KT vs GRF odds : 1.6 vs 2.2
[2:58:15] RuneBattleaxeXD: look, be REALISTIC. Uzi is good, yes, but Rikara is playing against the BEST in the West. Uzi on his BEST day cannot compete with Rikara. Rikara has been moulded by Aphromoo, one of the greatest bot-lane minds in League history
[2:58:23] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: C9 would beat griffin actually but only in a Bo5. I think griffin players champ pool is not good enough for Bo5 and thats their weakness and C9 loves to play 1-3-1 comps and are really good at that. Their macro is pretty good for a western team.
[2:58:27] janepatrick3323: can chinese people access Twitch ?
[2:58:38] KnifeWife1: yea
[2:58:41] PkProd07: ye but why

[2:58:58] Riki_lol: SO 2018 GRF WILL WIN TOO
[2:59:03] leskunk1: urgot in s5 finaals
[2:59:03] RuneBattleaxeXD: look, be REALISTIC. Uzi is good, yes, but Rikara is playing against the BEST in the West. Uzi on his BEST day cannot compete with Rikara. Rikara has been moulded by Aphromoo, one of the greatest bot-lane minds in League history
[2:59:09] AJLegacy: KAI$$A GG WP 2-2
[2:59:12] longhiep98: @fatalqwerty There were a lot of viewbots though
[2:59:18] FK_P: c9 and griffin are playing at similar levels IMO
[2:59:20] janepatrick3323: i thought they couldnt access twitch like google, youtube
[2:59:30] shikarie02: not necessary for twitch i think

[3:00:46] RuneBattleaxeXD: there's 5 chinese streaming platforms
[3:00:50] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Hauntzer destroyed Cuvee at worlds and this tells me that licorice is contender for being the best toplaner in the world in his first year. What a fantastic career.
[3:00:56] RuneBattleaxeXD: doyu, lplqq, panda, weqq
