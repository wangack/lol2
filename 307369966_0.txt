[4:40:34] ShuangHan: I'm eating Doritos LUL
[4:40:40] rngayemmm: RNG IG RW或者JDG去S 最好了
[4:40:44] wjy950312: nah licorice is better
[4:40:47] kabokao: jd中期一直很迷 真的不看好赢ig 其实ig也不是那么强
[4:40:50] pal2002: aha edg out and kt lose
[4:40:50] wjy950312: pls no Ray on c9
[4:40:52] vghost_zzz: iboy BibleThump
[4:40:52] nickthierry: 这俩队冒泡赛还要打一场
[4:40:59] 我先放个夹子马克一下: IG是真的强
[4:41:02] window7player: I'm drinking carlsberg beer with peanuts
[4:41:03] 国人晓迪: EDG LUL
[4:41:03] yousefbruh: KT still in worlds
[4:41:04] 我先放个夹子马克一下: 不信你继续看
[4:41:05] sunset375: IBOY
[4:41:10] noobie9999: ig 有实力翻盘的
[4:41:13] glgjss1: ig可能也要打冒泡赛
[4:41:19] pal2002: kt in worlds bu tlose lck LUL
[4:41:19] Butterburr: IG还不强 ...那什么队伍在你眼里算强
[4:41:19] kabokao: ig怕运营
[4:41:30] scribundis: EDG out of gauntlet?
[4:41:33] Demzdateetz: thank god there's no white cis males on this casters table
[4:41:36] sixzerotwotwonine: The Shy只要手沒受傷 1打9沒問題 LUL
[4:41:44] scribundis: @demzdateetz LUL
[4:41:47] croniq4l: @scribundis no
[4:41:49] sixzerotwotwonine: 怕就怕他的手又出問題 LUL
[4:41:49] Butterburr: RNG最会运营...你看IG怎么干RNG的么
[4:41:56] silenlg: GRF3：1KT JDG3:1EDG LUL
[4:41:57] Lparty: KT也要GG
[4:42:05] rngayemmm: IG不会打劣势 因为他们一直是优势局 劣势就完了、
[4:42:08] scribundis: @croniqlynx no they aint out or no they are not in it?
[4:42:25] croniq4l: @scribundis they are not out
[4:42:37] BellyRanks: EDG LUL
[4:42:39] scribundis: thx man
[4:42:40] rngayemmm: RNG这个分组真的舒服
[4:42:50] kgh357: edg = kt
[4:43:08] Wweixiao: 感觉lck也3-1了啊
[4:43:14] zcdcdcd: RNG基本已经进S塞了
[4:43:17] zcdcdcd: 积分太高
[4:43:26] Su1T_T1e: EDG LOSE SO RNG CAN GO S8 right?
[4:43:33] Wweixiao: 下个bo5输赢不影响？
[4:43:37] rngayemmm: RNG我就怕季后赛翻车还好分组很不错
[4:43:51] zcdcdcd: 没太大关系， 输了应该积分也是第二
[4:43:56] kabokao: ig还是多练练英雄池吧 又被套到死
[4:44:10] hamburgchoi: ？积分怎么可能第二
[4:44:18] hamburgchoi: 他要在资格赛第一个打了
[4:44:32] zcdcdcd: 什么资格赛
[4:44:44] Butterburr: IG一个常规赛第一名 被你们说的好像要降级了一样
[4:44:46] OMNlSCI3NCE: Who won
[4:44:47] rngayemmm: RNG赢了RW 积分就是第一了 现在还不好说
[4:44:48] Butterburr: 什么鬼
[4:44:57] OMNlSCI3NCE: What team won
[4:44:58] Su1T_T1e: Jdg won
[4:44:58] zcdcdcd: 现在季后赛第一名是夏季赛冠军 保送
[4:44:59] HimuraKyoya: Have another seriew
[4:45:00] HimuraKyoya: ?
[4:45:05] 我艹: ig积分第四
[4:45:07] zcdcdcd: 第二名是看积分算的
[4:45:32] hamburgchoi: 冠军保送，第二种子需要积分第一，edg必不会第二种子出现
[4:45:37] rngayemmm: RNG 春季赛冠军积分80 决赛输了也有160
[4:45:42] Su1T_T1e: 夏季赛冠军是一号种子,然后看积分
[4:45:44] zcdcdcd: 对啊 现在RNG积分很高
[4:45:45] 网络沉迷者: EDG LUL
[4:45:49] zcdcdcd: 所以基本第二了
[4:45:50] chx130423: RNG-RW tomorrow?
[4:45:51] hamburgchoi: 已经确定15号打资格赛争第三种子了
[4:45:51] rngayemmm: 这样的嘛。。
[4:45:51] QuestCape: does JD have any chance of taking IG down or nah?
[4:46:03] 网络沉迷者: 怎么可能
[4:46:03] Butterburr: Yes RNG RW tomorrow
[4:46:04] hamburgchoi: 中文解说都说了
[4:46:09] kabokao: ig在lpl的确是强 打世界赛绝对会掉链子
[4:46:12] zcdcdcd: 本来局势啊
[4:46:14] zcdcdcd: 就是啊
[4:46:16] hamburgchoi: 你还在这里第二出线
[4:46:18] sixzerotwotwonine: 不怕 國電明年有LMS的升降賽垃圾車來救援 一定可以重返農藥 LUL
[4:46:25] QuestCape: does JD have any chance of taking IG down or nah?
[4:46:35] FK_P: @QuestCape JDG is very good, but IG is insane
[4:46:35] hamburgchoi: 他要抢第三种子
[4:46:40] Butterburr: IG从来没打过世界赛...就成了绝对会掉链子了
[4:46:41] 网络沉迷者: RNG 现在保底130分
[4:46:42] chx130423: JDG OR IG
[4:46:54] FK_P: JDG had pretty much the same performance as RNG on regular season
[4:46:56] zcdcdcd: RNG要抢3号种子？？
[4:47:02] hamburgchoi: edg
[4:47:02] sixzerotwotwonine: IG有打過世界賽啊
[4:47:03] FK_P: and IG far above them
[4:47:10] Butterburr: 洲际赛打的不错啊
[4:47:10] zcdcdcd: 我们说RNG呢
[4:47:11] QuestCape: yep
[4:47:14] zcdcdcd: 你扯EDG
[4:47:17] QuestCape: Rookie is insane
[4:47:19] hamburgchoi: 哇你说rng
[4:47:22] 网络沉迷者: 如果明天输了 拿第三可能2号种子
[4:47:22] QuestCape: best mid in the world for sure
[4:47:25] Su1T_T1e: Rng好像下局赢了就进了吧,积分第二
[4:47:32] hamburgchoi: edg为什么要说rng
[4:47:35] rngayemmm: RNG抢个屁3号种子
[4:47:37] makruperunat: 2-2?
[4:47:45] rngayemmm: RNG明天赢了 就进S了
[4:48:00] rngayemmm: 至少2号种子
[4:48:04] Su1T_T1e: 拿第三积分也是第二吧
[4:48:04] hamburgchoi: 居然有人担心rng
[4:48:04] QuestCape: before Ucal came to KT I always had hoped that Rookie comes back to KT over PawN
[4:48:12] sixzerotwotwonine: 如果明天沒贏呢
[4:48:25] zcdcdcd: 我们在讨论哪个队基本已经进S赛了、
[4:48:33] zcdcdcd: 所以菜说RNG
[4:48:38] zcdcdcd: EDG基本凉了
[4:48:42] rngayemmm: 没赢 好像也进了吧 积分够的 其他队的积分都不高
[4:48:46] 网络沉迷者: RW也很强好不
[4:48:47] hamburgchoi: 理论上还没有，那没必要说啊
[4:48:55] FK_P: I think they were already waiting for JackeyLove to age @QuestCape
[4:49:06] 我艹: rw容易暴毙
[4:49:16] hamburgchoi: 感谢jdg
[4:49:17] FK_P: RW RNG IG JDG PogChamp
[4:49:19] Butterburr: 明天没赢 如果RW夺冠 就不够分
[4:49:22] hamburgchoi: 为国除害
[4:49:30] 我艹: 洲际赛前没人说rw强
[4:49:36] 网络沉迷者: SMLZ对UZI完全不吃亏
[4:49:40] QuestCape: @FK_P hopefully I will see the strengths of JackeyLove in JDG vs IG so far from what ive seen he seems pretty lackluster
[4:49:50] hamburgchoi: 不是不强，是不够稳
[4:49:52] Butterburr: 不过RNG三号种子去世界赛...真的吓死人
[4:49:53] QuestCape: just gets carried by Duke/TheShy and Rookie every game
[4:50:01] Su1T_T1e: 但是uzi加上ming大于smlz
[4:50:03] zcdcdcd: 只要RW不拿冠军，RNG保底都是第二
[4:50:06] hamburgchoi: rw练阵练得人头晕
[4:50:08] rngayemmm: 所以RW要打赢RNG IG或者JDG ，RNG才会去打冒泡赛
[4:50:23] FK_P: 2017 spring IG had the same roster except for Jackeylove
[4:50:24] x050a: BANG!
[4:50:31] 网络沉迷者: 够 IG春季才第四
[4:50:42] FK_P: and they were on the same lvl as WE
[4:50:55] FK_P: with Jackeylove they dominated even RNG on scrims
[4:50:56] Butterburr: 夏季赛同样名词分数比春季赛多
[4:51:02] hamburgchoi: 说5选3，其实就是4选3
[4:51:13] QuestCape: imo, despite WE being 3rd seed at worlds last year, they were the best team in CN at the time
[4:51:15] FK_P: jackeylove makes a big difference on the team
[4:51:17] rngayemmm: EDG就是捞比。。
[4:51:20] sixzerotwotwonine: 所以rng要去打冒泡的唯一可能就是rw奪冠吧
[4:51:22] Su1T_T1e: 理想队伍rng ig rw
[4:51:23] hamburgchoi: rng ig rw jd 这就够了
[4:51:28] 网络沉迷者: 第三名70分呢 90+70 160
[4:51:36] QuestCape: shame to see how far WE has fallen :(
[4:51:46] ZyH6HyZ: ...
[4:51:50] Butterburr: 是的...基本不现实 RNG挺稳的
[4:51:53] hamburgchoi: edg才有可能160
[4:51:56] SkepticID: whats the score
[4:52:05] QuestCape: its done @SkepticID 3-1 JDG
[4:52:06] FK_P: JDG 3-1
[4:52:13] hamburgchoi: 输了他就没了
[4:52:15] rngayemmm: RNG和RW交手 RNG应该没输过吧 RNG最近状态还可以 问题不大
[4:52:25] hamburgchoi: 现在edg100分
[4:52:26] 网络沉迷者: EDG只有第三和第四了 他才70分
[4:52:28] SkepticID: thanks
[4:52:30] QuestCape: how do you guys think rest of playoffs will turn out
[4:52:35] hamburgchoi: rng最少130
[4:52:40] zcdcdcd: EDG有个卵子160
[4:52:43] Su1T_T1e: Rng确实状态不错,明天比赛好看了
[4:52:48] zcdcdcd: RNG现在都130 最高
[4:52:49] ZyH6HyZ: JDG 能赢EDG 也能给RNG那么大压力 我觉得 还是 IG RNG JDG 这3个去好
[4:52:55] QuestCape: RNG > RW, IG > JDG, IG > RNG and JDG > RW for me
[4:52:56] Butterburr: RW靠打架...RNG打架不怂的...基本是个IG RNG决赛
[4:53:01] zcdcdcd: EDG打猫猫赛了
[4:53:01] hamburgchoi: 他要赢才有160
[4:53:03] hamburgchoi: 不是吗
[4:53:08] 我艹: EDG凉了
[4:53:17] hamburgchoi: 感谢京东
[4:53:21] FK_P: same, but RW beating JDG
[4:53:22] QuestCape: @RUSTYTheCASTER @Razleplasm is that the birds nest from worlds grand final last year? POGGERS
[4:53:23] zcdcdcd: EDG只能打冒泡了 哪来160？
[4:53:25] FK_P: it's a coinflip
[4:53:30] tasuyaz: DansGame DansGame
[4:53:31] 网络沉迷者: EDG只能打冒泡赛了
[4:53:35] hamburgchoi: 我不是说他没了吗
[4:53:43] sixzerotwotwonine: 不會的 國電不會亡 我相信EDG還是能拿第三種子出國 要不然國電面子掛不住 LUL
[4:53:45] zcdcdcd: 冒泡又不算积分
[4:53:46] hamburgchoi: 钢精
[4:53:47] rngayemmm: EDG冒泡赛也打不过其他队啊
[4:53:47] Su1T_T1e: Supercarry vs true god POGGERS
[4:53:50] Lparty: 飞行员又暴毙了
[4:53:54] zcdcdcd: 现在RNG保底130
[4:54:08] haichiman: RNG好像进S8了
[4:54:13] zcdcdcd: 有威胁的就是RW，RW不拿冠军 ，RNG保底第二
[4:54:27] QuestCape: I think RNG vs RW will be 3-2 either way hope xiaohu steps up
[4:54:34] rngayemmm: RW一串2 还是2个强队 很难的
[4:54:48] Su1T_T1e: 确实难
[4:54:48] zcdcdcd: IG不拿冠军，积分不够
