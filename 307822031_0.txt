[0:16:58] viores8: they'll give their fans a break from international disappointment
[0:17:05] haringpb: Tsm biggest mistake was to kick doublelift for zven not because doublelift is better but they denied themself importslots

[0:20:03] Suited777: Is uzi starting tonight?
[0:20:03] haringpb: Yeah but the improvement is not big enough over doublelift which is kind of obvious. Also the option of having double + aphrom might have been possible and you have to think that would have been 100% better
[0:20:04] klubbo: i think it has to do with franchising btw
[0:20:20] cowfan798: riot being dumb
[0:20:22] Tibberous: @viores8 tsm just needs to remake the whole roster.
[0:20:25] danielprokie: this is chinese stream LUL bacause we are saying english
