But one should not feel entitled to have more value than any other person who does not necessarily express through art. Being an artist doesn't make you awesome: you are just yourself like anyone else.

[4:31:32] AstralLight911: The slit-eye videos that you see all over the web are fake. The Illuminati put these out intentionally to mislead everyone into thinking that one can tell who is a “reptilian” (Vril lizard and a host of Vril aka drone) by checking to see, if their eyes turn to slits. This doesn’t occur and they cannot do this.
