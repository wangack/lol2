[2:48:01] badmancris1557: @rebeccamo dude has passion for casting, and the game. These guys just say wow so meh :( I just don’t enjoy their casting.
[2:48:07] 2swag4u: 48 hours
[2:48:15] heyyoo1234: yeah
[2:48:24] HystericsCasts: Frosk was the face, and now the LPL needs someone which is fair, but we also have raz!
[2:48:30] heyyoo1234: PAPA keeps it enertaining
[2:48:31] il_irredento: i don't think any casters can really hype up these trash teams

[2:49:11] greyyy_: 4/5 out of the 6/7 lol casters leaving is really the thing. Yet we need to give some time to the 2 new casters before judging anything
[2:49:15] Envoy_of_the_End: Frosk PepeHands

[2:49:33] lovenishimiya: no now will ever take Frosk place
[2:49:33] badmancris1557: @hystericscasts I watch all regions as much as I can but casting really helps feel the big plays. Idk they just need some hype cast. Like there “there it goes” sound so boring!!!!!

[2:51:21] OviHyperion: @HystericsCasts u are awesome dude for me
[2:51:32] badmancris1557: @hystericscasts yea this bald headed guy seems new but they need passion. Gets the views. But China has good fast plays. And wide range of games to watch. Sadly their low teams kinda play bad (team oriented) individually they are better than me
[2:51:50] HystericsCasts: still developing though @lhyperioni !

[2:59:59] flamazide: granted you can also get subbed out if you play really poorly but often you just get subbed out. Duke plays over TheShy a lot despite TheShy being the best toplaner in the world
[3:00:01] ewcing: The team training in North America was really strong, I don’t know why I can’t play it.
