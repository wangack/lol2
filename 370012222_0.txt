[1:27:04] pilotflame: kramer is good player
[1:27:06] 21044275: its decided by how popular the players are
[1:27:34] dashdash421: DWG, GRF, G2, and IG top 4 teams right now?
[1:27:34] 21044275: it has nothing to do with skills, it just use the ranking system of league, it rank up with votes from fans
[1:28:01] kthuang: dwg？
[1:28:24] 21044275: top 3 teams in the world are IG, SNG and FPX
[1:28:55] dashdash421: GRF looks scary good
[1:29:16] 21044275: ig is world champs with no change, sng is as super team as it gets, fpx with top tier shot caller and talents

[1:39:25] chrisrox22: RNG int every spilt then uzi returns and they smurf into playoffs and final
[1:39:26] Cneezy2869: @chrisrox22 yea but that's easy with a bunch of trash teams, LOL has to have more teams th a any other league so they can have a bunch of trash teams for teams like IG and RNG to stomp
[1:39:38] Cneezy2869: LPL*
[1:39:42] 21044275: not just uzi, they allowed for letme's selfishness too

[2:51:37] EsportsTj: I only watch this stream so I can paint screenshots Nibiria
[2:51:37] HeilsaintTV: @fancti it depends
[2:51:48] Quakkulol: lgd
[2:51:56] HeilsaintTV: LPL has more agressivity
[2:51:57] icant_kekw: @fancti if slower gameplay with emphasis on macro play is more exciting, LCK
[2:52:03] Quakkulol: then 2:0 for top
[2:52:09] EsportsTj: You might not like it, but Nibiria is the ideal male form.
[2:52:16] HeilsaintTV: LCK most respect
[2:52:33] Laphx: lck hasn't even been interesting though
[2:52:45] Laphx: very game 2-0
[2:52:46] Hankmardukiss: Griffin has
[2:52:59] icant_kekw: @fancti personally, LPL as a region has adapted their own form of macro play via strong team fighting and instinctual decisions made, so I prefer LPL
[2:53:02] Laphx: i mean the storyline sure, but the gameplay it's just stomps
[2:53:05] EsportsTj: Literally no one should dislike it though. Nibiria was powerful enough that the mere sight of him made me leave Mormonism.
[2:53:21] EsportsTj: He just had that big jesus energy.
[2:53:21] icant_kekw: @fancti also they denied Korea an international title last year xD

[2:55:21] EsportsTj: Nibiria's smile cures most common colds
[2:55:25] HeilsaintTV: DIDNT U SAW THE TSM ROST?
