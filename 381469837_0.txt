[1:42:25] PCCSantos: @greenndreams I wouldn’t say he’s trash but he hasn’t been peak since 2015. Hoping he still has it.
[1:42:28] n3app: hello how i can receive lol mission for watching

[2:03:14] supermechacynpai: Southwind definitely needs more competitive experience for that roster to develop, because they rely so much on him, and hes still inconsistent

[2:07:28] michaelsund: @HystericsCasts and LPL has insane botlanes SeemsGood
[2:07:30] iopeca: average
[2:07:36] supermechacynpai: @HystericsCasts G2 reminds me of their first split in LCS, a bunch of players having fun, and outplaying mechanically without a coach able to control them
[2:07:36] TomShoe: I love NA to death but they have a terrible mid game
[2:07:37] hardllyescape: IG waiting room
[2:07:38] HystericsCasts: LPL has insane top lanes this season as well
[2:07:42] belacqua_: Yeah the depth of talent in LPL is truly insane
[2:07:48] supermechacynpai: theyll fall apart again internationally
[2:07:49] baejoohyun26: @HystericsCasts Did you think that EDG actually had the upper hand against FNC last worlds? Just that they drafted and threw in games, 2 3 4
[2:07:53] chogimnn: LEVI LUL BENCHED LUL
[2:07:58] HystericsCasts: G2 is just nutty because it's over before it's begun haha

[2:08:17] HystericsCasts: @baejoohyun26 I think no one knows what EDG are doing, not even themselves

[2:08:58] TomShoe: more like PeeDG amirite
[2:08:59] supermechacynpai: I predict RNG >EDG unless clearlove coming in has cleared up a bunch of issues with the comms and mid game map movements
[2:08:59] HystericsCasts: I mean EDG just lost to WE who look disgusting this split
[2:09:01] LevelOneMudkip: True
[2:09:03] xcitta: WTF is that Tyler1 and his best friend Deibi? Hit follow and subscribe on my channel guys! :O PogChamp Kappa LUL
[2:09:09] flamazide: EDG is a team that is fine in the first 15-20 minutes in the game then they have no plan
[2:09:12] LevelOneMudkip: Zoom and YaGao during worlds meta
[2:09:17] 1kenn1: is WE still playing late game
[2:09:23] HystericsCasts: They can take that loss to WE and then come back and force 3 games out of RNG
[2:09:23] supermechacynpai: they all looked lost far too often in the mid game, and Ray has been a liability
[2:09:26] baejoohyun26: @HystericsCasts Although not many games have been played. What mid laner is performing the best?
[2:09:33] flamazide: if you just wait long enough EDG will beat themselves
[2:09:38] belacqua_: @LevelOneMudkip Kreygasm would've been so hype if JDG and Griffin made worlds
[2:09:41] 1kenn1: EDG could use a new toplaner imo
[2:09:57] 1kenn1: EDG vs WE is that the one with Ray vladimir
[2:09:58] HystericsCasts: I want to say Knight but for consistencies sake I said Kuro before this game
[2:10:00] flamazide: @baejoohyun26 Knight is the best performing mid laner but that doesnt factor in level of competition
[2:10:03] xcitta: GIVE ME FOLLOW AND SUBSCRIBE ON MY CHANNEL PLS LUL THANKS YOU LUL
[2:10:03] baejoohyun26: @1kenn1 I believe Ray is alright, but who to replace?

[2:10:14] LevelOneMudkip: At least SMLZ is in a great position to finally make worlds this year. I believe in Suning.
[2:10:24] Yolo_pete: What is this music WutFace
[2:10:25] HystericsCasts: I mean Kuro had a 12.2 KDA before that last game
[2:10:36] supermechacynpai: I said this a lot during their last series, but EDG need to put Ray on the picks with more consistency like urgot, and Scout on the high skill expression picks like Ryze, not the other way around
[2:10:40] 1kenn1: any chinese toplaner.

[2:11:22] flamazide: @HystericsCasts honestly kuro's kda is misleading. when they played against OMG Icon appeared to have a bigger impact in the game which i think should be considered

[2:11:48] ifkongbai: 我来看看 又木有中国人
[2:11:53] Novattor: LUL LUL
[2:11:53] HystericsCasts: doinb's ceiling is broken and just keeps building up - Scout is as well but Scout is much like Doinb, always been a staple midlaner who performs well 9 times out of 10
[2:11:55] 小艾同學: lck就来给lpl送选手的

[2:13:06] sevenyam: @HystericsCasts will you cast Sundays games?
[2:13:07] belacqua_: @supermechacynpai so did everyone LUL
[2:13:10] baejoohyun26: @HystericsCasts What actually happened to the solo kill god xiaohu? I feel like he has been on a decline since 2018. But last night's game was alright.
[2:13:12] flamazide: @baejoohyun26 he did fine last game. the rest of the league just got better. the LPL is a very competitive region. also, the draft/style of play RNG opts in to affects Xiaohu a lot
[2:13:17] xcitta: ye its me probably @keccak256
[2:13:25] LevelOneMudkip: Which supports are worth looking out for atm? I’ve been impressed by SwordArt and Southwind but are the other supports worth looking at?

[2:14:55] supermechacynpai: RNG EDG is going to be really interesting as a tell of what happened to them over the break, Uzi, and Clearlove both back consistently at least in scrims
[2:14:59] LevelOneMudkip: HeaQ
[2:15:00] HystericsCasts: Bvoy

[2:15:14] baejoohyun26: @HystericsCasts I watched all RNG's games last year. It was definately the Uzi show and xiaohu did really good on ryze game 5, but at worlds i felt he fell off. Normally he pops off as ryze. but lost to perkz lb.
[2:15:15] 小酌: In lpl fpx is the best team now
[2:15:20] keccak256: @deibi94 what role you play/stream?
[2:15:21] gamzeroslevi: levi?
[2:15:25] NaMeiiii: Karthus would be the perfect champ for Clearlove because he won't need to gank 4Head
[2:15:26] baejoohyun26: @flamazide do you think icon is overrated?
[2:15:36] michaelsund: Levi career is a meme 4Head
[2:15:37] Yolo_pete: Is Rookie still good here?
[2:15:40] supermechacynpai: @HystericsCasts Am I missing something with Bvoy? he was bad at demacia and i havent seen him since
[2:15:45] allisterding: DGL>all

[2:16:17] gamzeroslevi: levi no english
[2:16:24] xcitta: @keccak256 trying to help low elo players right now :)
[2:16:28] HystericsCasts: He played in the IG series and has actually improved a lot, for starters he has decent mechanics.
[2:16:35] baejoohyun26: @supermechacynpai I feel like he lost form. But hopefully he gets back to form. After worlds he got a girlfriend and did a lot of variety tv shows and stuff
[2:16:39] mash1ro_o: FPX>IG>SNG>EDG>JDG>RNG

[2:16:55] 小酌: Who will better with fpx and TL?
[2:16:56] flamazide: @baejoohyun26 he doesnt seem to be rated that highly currently. i think he's very good but he isnt a top 3 midlaner in the LPL but he wont get smashed by anyone
[2:17:00] keccak256: atm only making it rain bitz for saber atm though.
[2:17:10] xcitta: thanks @keccak256 appreciate that! rainbo9LOVE
[2:17:15] mash1ro_o: FPX>IG>SNG>EDG>JDG>RNG
[2:17:21] baejoohyun26: @flamazide Didn't he get smashed by Knight. Akali vs Jayce
[2:17:34] allisterding: DGL>3M>GODV
[2:17:37] baejoohyun26: @flamazide flame horizoned at like 15-20 min or something
[2:17:39] supermechacynpai: I'd love to see him find some form but the outcry was 'please get a new ad this one is trash' and I missed the IG series.
[2:17:40] flamazide: @baejoohyun26 well yeah but knight is on another planet haha i dont count him
[2:18:10] mazezhong1994: LPL》ALL

[2:18:31] pleasestopracism: not whatever that akali was
[2:18:32] HystericsCasts: It's hard because Xiaohu is often left on his own, sometimes he struggles
[2:18:38] gloomygro: anyone know what song was "lost in this confusion"
[2:18:51] baejoohyun26: @flamazide yea knight is crazy good mechanically.
[2:18:56] HystericsCasts: Happiness is an illusion, try googling that
[2:19:01] 小酌: Most Chinese prefer to watch match in Chinese APP
[2:19:07] baejoohyun26: @HystericsCasts what's your favourite lpl team
[2:19:19] HystericsCasts: At the moment - FPX

[2:19:33] mash1ro_o: FPX>IG>SNG>EDG>JDG>RNG
[2:19:42] HystericsCasts: Watching a team playing all around an insane midlaner who has unique picks is bonkers
[2:19:43] baejoohyun26: @HystericsCasts What team makes you nervous when your favourite team plays them?
[2:19:44] mazezhong1994: No omp！！！！！
[2:19:47] osklift: Imp 😍
[2:19:48] flamazide: Doinb is so much fun to watch

[2:22:20] flamazide: Yagao on Zoe
[2:22:27] baejoohyun26: yagao zoe gg
[2:22:36] supermechacynpai: Well first of all the team plays heavily around forcing you to respond to mid, giving the bot lane complete freedom a la fnatic at worlds
[2:22:38] mash1ro_o: FPX>IG>SNG>EDG>JDG>RNG

[2:23:15] Butterburr: so TOP is worse than all of them?
[2:23:18] Dorian_N7: bot lane is gonna be sick
[2:23:21] supermechacynpai: so any team that can hold mid even -> well and then invest resources into a botlane that outplays them
[2:23:24] mazezhong1994: SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[2:23:28] 1kenn1: Yagao way better.
[2:23:34] Raja093: sd
[2:23:40] 1kenn1: what did Kuro play in his prime lulu mid?
[2:23:46] HystericsCasts: Yagao is definitely better than Kuro now \
[2:23:51] supermechacynpai: I'm looking at obviously IG, and TOP in that, but SMLZ has been off form
[2:24:18] 토도0: KURO PLAYS LEBLANC WELL?
[2:24:19] mash1ro_o: 我忘了还有个top了 BabyRage

[2:32:09] supermechacynpai: slight note, when you bounce off a target with kalista ult, you land at your base auto attack range, so Ali would be in melee range where as Jinjao would be 500 units away
