[2:06:07] theraiderrr: there is no chance WE win a match
[2:06:07] yudai95: to the people who say G2 is stronger than TL, look at the match ups: perkz-miky vs DL-corejj? slightly one sided right? then caps vs jensen, it would be either even, or maybe caps could get a slight advantage, then theres jankos vs xmithie, have u seen xmithie's lee sin? he would dumpster jankos, finaly theres wunder vs impact, impact is a world champion enoguh said
[2:06:13] Hurrica1n: I like the dude at the right
[2:06:16] TATboy: GodV is my favorite player,and now he is playing PUBG

[2:07:24] Xkan14: @yudai95 yikes lmao
[2:07:28] wuqiannianga: The match up? TL always performed badly in world, It isn't about match up.
[2:07:33] 1kenn1: DL corejj will destroy g2
[2:07:34] Hurrica1n: @yudai95 Wake up dude. Caps > Jensen by far and Jankos can be really strong with vision and mapcontrol

[4:53:13] Davidblanco: como dice un buen refran 好的鉴赏家就是没有言语说出一切的人
[4:53:15] grendel1337: i still didnt get it
[4:53:21] 우후리여: ig는 우승은힘들수도잇서 머가문제인지 갑자기 맛이가벼렷거든 ..
[4:53:26] grendel1337: watched almost every match
[4:53:46] rokpd2007: rng가 결국 다전제가면 우승할듯
[4:54:00] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: looking at that list i would rank griffin between the level of victory five and edg
[4:54:06] 우후리여: 어제 LGD전도 사실 불안햇던게 그냥터진거야. 재키러브 안나와서 바텀이 터졋다 이런거이전에 상체가 갑자기 심하게 맛이갓서
[4:54:14] 안되겠네: 그러네 IG는 RNG 다전제에서 못이겨봤지 아마?
[4:54:17] skadanaa: GRIFFIN WOULD BE WHERE VICI GAMING IS
[4:54:24] grendel1337: then why nobody can beat them?
[4:54:30] rokpd2007: 원래 재키없으면 그냥 17ig랑똑같은데
[4:54:36] Harry_PotHead420BlazeIt: new teams top2? xqcT
[4:54:38] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: because they play in LCK
[4:54:48] rokpd2007: 17 ig도 그냥 상체기복에따라 이기고지는팀이었음 웨스트는 그냥 꾸준히못했고
[4:54:49] EzeroChalicer: why so many esport team in lpl?
[4:54:51] xTiLkx: TSM would smurf on griffin
[4:54:53] blackpink1015: 제캐러브 어디갔음???
[4:54:54] borealiss_: POUFSOUFFLE
[4:55:07] RonaanKes: SERPENTAR
[4:55:07] blackpink1015: 제키러브
[4:55:07] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: if GRF played in LPL or LEC they would drop so many games.. in LCS i could see grf 2nd,3rd place there.. TL are also a pretty good team.
[4:55:08] grendel1337: hahah
[4:55:11] EzeroChalicer: @xtilkx you mean team liquid? Kappa
[4:55:16] hamburgchoi: top jdg
[4:55:23] borealiss_: GRYNFONDORE
[4:55:26] hamburgchoi: wowoo
[4:55:26] skadanaa: EVEN TSM COULD BEAT GRIFFIN
[4:55:34] chance12388: match of the week
[4:55:36] kazewinds: TL is a good team in NA, not a good team Kappa
[4:55:38] EzeroChalicer: where's jdg levi?
[4:55:40] TATboy: yeah beacuse TSM NO1
[4:55:44] grendel1337: tl is good cuz na sucks and so u are sayinh lpl better then lck?
[4:55:55] grendel1337: x doubt
[4:56:00] kazewinds: LPL>LCK yeah
[4:56:02] will_o_will: bang best adc on 100T
[4:56:08] 우후리여: 재키러브 아파서 결장이라는데 내부사정은모르지 .ㅋㅋ
[4:56:08] DanielRzZz: PogChamp
[4:56:11] kazewinds: This year atleast
[4:56:16] grendel1337: hmm well yeah cant argue lck was shit last worlds
[4:56:37] 우후리여: 어제 ig 원딜보면서느낀게 그냥 다시 구단주 원딜시키는게나아보일정도로 어제나왓던애가못햇스니 ..
[4:56:39] afraidyo: cringe af caster xd
[4:56:43] kazewinds: The last year, they just had a bad meta in worlds but LCK was > to LPL i think
[4:56:51] FergusX: bye casters <3
[4:57:11] grendel1337: well if im not wrong lck where the first to go no?
[4:57:12] 우후리여: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[4:57:14] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: MSI had a bad meta too?
[4:57:15] SohaiTheShern: how was game 2?
[4:57:25] grendel1337: it was tight af
[4:57:26] 건초먹는토끼: who won?
[4:57:27] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: 4Head MSI had a bad meta too for LCK? 4Head
[4:57:35] grendel1337: till uzi woke up and rng did
[4:57:39] kazewinds: Yeah, got 3-2 by IG, but as I said, the meta was just bad for their macro
[4:57:46] Murdurburd: This song my jam
[4:57:47] singote24: Eqius De
[4:57:54] deadstar322: asdsad
[4:57:56] SohaiTheShern: thx dude
[4:58:04] FergusX: UZI PogChamp
[4:58:04] grendel1337: true cant argue that that said so as well if not wrong
[4:58:26] grendel1337: but u gotta give it to uzi he is the backbone of rng
[4:58:28] Butterburr: Yeah S5 meta was bad for LPL, otherwise LGD would have beat SKT? pls don't bring this kind of shit up
[4:58:30] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: lol IG should have 3-0'd KT. The series didn't look close KT got lucky with the nexus rush and dont forget the next game IG played with duke. KT would struggle to beat C9.
[4:58:30] kazewinds: I would even say that LEC>LCK this year
[4:58:53] grendel1337: well not rly
[4:59:04] Murdurburd: @kazeeeeeeeeee72 not even close. Griffin, Damwon, Sandbox and SKt are above even G2
[4:59:08] grendel1337: besides g2 everybody else is just meh
[4:59:12] kazewinds: No
[4:59:23] kazewinds: Griffin, yeah, SKT is not better than G2
[4:59:26] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Origen, VIT, G2, S04 are insane
[4:59:26] grendel1337: i think this g2 actually stands a cvhance
[4:59:34] kazewinds: And the mid level of LEC is very high
[4:59:45] grendel1337: caps
[4:59:46] kazewinds: Maybe the best of all time
[4:59:59] Murdurburd: they stand a chance sure, but G2 is known to snowball mid. Teddy outclasses Perkz easily and top lane is just who can frontline better. Faker can play a more defensive role and avoid dying
[5:00:04] kazewinds: (midstanding, not midlane)
[5:00:08] theviper12: G2 > GRF
[5:00:16] 乛乛: after yesterday performance sure
[5:00:18] soundpraenk: g2 have no chance if crit meta will stay, perkz is really bad at crit adc's :)
[5:00:18] singote24: Klok
[5:00:19] svens_ex_boyfriend: So many strong teams in lpl PogChamp
[5:00:23] HighwayCo: so where does lpl come into all this?
[5:00:26] Murdurburd: I would love to see Chovy vs Caps though
[5:00:27] grendel1337: sure they lost
[5:00:31] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Faker is mid tier midlaner at best worldwide.
[5:00:32] theviper12: lpl is weak
[5:00:32] bigruse: jdg vs top will be awesome!!!!!
[5:00:38] grendel1337: bcs origen was very clean
[5:00:46] 100t7777: CN AD EU Mid KR Top NA 4fun LUL
[5:00:46] kazewinds: @Arnej35 I would not say no chance, but less yeah
[5:00:51] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: The only midlaner in LCK who stands a chance vs caps is Chovy.
[5:01:02] grendel1337: faker is not the best anymore his glory days are over
[5:01:05] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: and im not even talking about the best midlaner in EU and west (nukeduck)
[5:01:18] Murdurburd: LPL is pretty top heavy. IG is like the only team to worry about. I'm still not confident in EDG or RNG at international events
[5:01:38] 乛乛: I just G2 bot lane will fall more in the future
[5:01:41] soundpraenk: even yesterday, we could see how bad on classic adc's Perkz performs, absolutely zero impact on game
[5:01:42] lvlandfarm1: hey
[5:01:44] LaoWai42: @Murdurburd are you trolling?
[5:02:03] svens_ex_boyfriend: @murdurburd delusional FailFish
[5:02:13] kazewinds: @Arnej35 I did not watch the yesterday's match but you cannot say somthing on only 1 game
[5:02:14] lvlandfarm1: I won
[5:02:17] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: IG isn't even the best LPL team now with jackeylove. We can already give the trophy to funplus tbh.
[5:02:33] Murdurburd: @Laowai42 no, just going based on what I've seen this year regionally and last years worlds which is the most recent games we have to go by
[5:02:34] grendel1337: perkz has to stick to his game but tbh caps was shit too
[5:02:44] Murdurburd: @Laowai42 i can just look at things objectively and not with fan goggles on
[5:02:46] LaoWai42: @Murdurburd if you believe that tune in for top jdg
