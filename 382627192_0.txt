[0:01:18] trisssmerigold: first
[0:01:36] trisssmerigold: im the 1st viewer
[0:02:08] trisssmerigold: I am
[0:02:27] trisssmerigold: hi
[0:03:04] trisssmerigold: is there schedule for the broadcast?
[0:03:15] trisssmerigold: seems all random
[0:03:40] trisssmerigold: i just drop in occasionally
[0:03:54] trisssmerigold: id rather watch the cn stream,
[0:04:38] trisssmerigold: everytime im here,the caster's castings are like, yo what you doing here get out
[0:05:08] trisssmerigold: oh ok
[0:05:21] trisssmerigold: there should be better supervising
[0:05:43] flamazide: ?
[0:05:51] trisssmerigold: like in LCK, theres no one in the lpl broadcast to tell these casters gtfo if you trash more these pro players
[0:06:14] trisssmerigold: you make my pro league into a clown fiesta to laugh at, youd better gtfo
[0:06:34] trisssmerigold: but sadlly i dont think theres one who knows his stuff at the lpl en broadcast
[0:06:44] trisssmerigold: the most senior is pbbly clement
[0:07:02] trisssmerigold: who is absolutely trash, unlike in LCK theres papasmithy
[0:07:13] flamazide: what dont you like about the casting exactly? i missed your point at the start
[0:07:15] trisssmerigold: thats the problem
[0:07:35] trisssmerigold: every clement's cast is like "HOW ARE THEY SO BAD? i, i , i cant believe it, how ,just why and how why this bad
[0:07:49] flamazide: i...dont recall him ever saying that
[0:07:56] Lev1athanGRE: the question is
[0:08:09] Lev1athanGRE: Which caster do you like inj LPL? no1 actually, no1 is good enough
[0:08:12] trisssmerigold: there always a losing side and wining side
[0:08:24] flamazide: also, youd HATE the chinese casting. they mention player's mistakes a lot more. also, why shouldnt you acknowledge a person's mistakes?
[0:08:34] flamazide: haha i say also too much
[0:08:42] trisssmerigold: every play can be great play from the one out playing, or the one losing like trash player, Clement always stress how the losing side are bad and he already seen it coming
[0:09:04] trisssmerigold: to show he's analyzing prowess
[0:09:06] lagnumber: anyone wanna have a quick match?
[0:09:20] flamazide: LS is a caster and he mentions the mistakes the players make
[0:09:39] trisssmerigold: or for whatever reason, he should try to go into some basic casting training progrom or something , im sure riot at LCS EU or NA make their new recvurits go through
[0:09:51] flamazide: @SpagooterLive not for LPL games
[0:10:03] flamazide: just twitch
[0:10:14] flamazide: and the chinese platforms like duoya or whatever
[0:10:30] Lev1athanGRE: @rattybag she casted china u mean
[0:10:32] thomas180999: did u get ur rewards on lol ?
[0:10:57] trisssmerigold: @flamazide if you honestly cant find the huge and instant immense difference between LCK and LPL casting when youre watchingit, good for you,
[0:11:14] flamazide: you just ignored what i said entirely
[0:11:17] lapercog: cant wait to watch JDG Clid today PogChamp ..... oh wait FeelsBadMan
[0:11:27] Lev1athanGRE: There's a dif between LS (?) in the plays and the LPL casters, LS says things like, what? why would he go for that play bcs he knows the players and they do smthing unusually bad
[0:11:34] chiprosthesimplemortal: SourPls
[0:11:41] trisssmerigold: the tone,the wording, the chemistry, the play by play the analysis, huge different at all levels
[0:11:43] four20x69: 48 minutes?!
[0:11:53] trisssmerigold: for lol, not asking for much, i just wish they'd stop trashing the losing side
[0:11:56] xxerox00: isnt next match like right now ?
[0:11:59] Lev1athanGRE: In LPL the casters clearly have pretty low game knowledge and everything that looks bad they Give it even mroe emphasis
[0:12:14] trisssmerigold: and analyze how the winning side outplayed, rather than constnatly making it like they're casitng a bronze game
[0:12:14] flamazide: @xxerox00 naw the first game of the day isnt for another hour
[0:12:52] 외로운장고: thank god
[0:13:04] 외로운장고: today is lpl day
[0:13:12] Lev1athanGRE: I remember JDG 1-2 days ago when they won 1st game vs BLG and they made a lot of mistackes in the game ending scenario, but ofc no caster had an idea and they thought they played it perfect
[0:13:22] Lev1athanGRE: And even gave them props for the play
[0:13:24] trisssmerigold: its annoying when Clement bring out common knowledge for 5 times and stress how he knew it and the play doesnt, thus they lost
[0:14:04] g0tt4getswifty: SS <3!!!!!!!!
[0:14:08] trisssmerigold: in LCK, every tiny random common movie is hype and calculated
[0:14:16] flamazide: so...the issue is that they DONT mention the mistakes? i still dont understand what the original point was. thats what i was asking about
[0:14:25] trisssmerigold: in LPL, every mistake is like this huge clown fiesta to be laughed at, the stream is like salty teemo stream
[0:14:29] Lev1athanGRE: I remember how good Rusty was on the knowledge part, he would always know what to say about both teams, also always asked things on twitter and commented on posts to learn even more
[0:14:52] BigTachungus: !uptime
[0:14:52] Moobot: @BigTachungus Uptime: 14m 54s :)
[0:15:20] cyoid: i like clement casting :((
[0:15:30] cyoid: who cares just watch them games
[0:15:38] Lev1athanGRE: Casting isn't only making the game fun and hype, it's also explaining what happens in the game so that everyone can clearly understand why everything happens
[0:15:39] trisssmerigold: when they're actually playing at the highest level of the world, the casters either just lack the knowledge to explain many of the moves, so they have to stress how the players are bad to make them sound competent
[0:15:50] xxerox00: why i can't find the next match in the shedule?
[0:15:53] realredgg: HeyGuys
[0:16:13] Lev1athanGRE: the "Hype" is completely irrelevant to casting, the only part where the word hype can be used is when play by play casters break down fights
[0:16:17] flamazide: @xxerox00 what are you trying to find exactly?
[0:16:17] realredgg: 44 minutes!?
[0:16:17] 0FFT: ESKETIIT PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:16:28] xxerox00: the next match in the shedule
[0:16:41] flamazide: SS vs BLG
[0:17:01] Lev1athanGRE: @rattybag you mean that there are no color casters right?
[0:17:02] realredgg: what youll rank?
[0:17:54] realredgg: im proud gold now that was stuck silver for like for ever SeemsGood
[0:18:13] realredgg: was plat for good old 6 hours lol
[0:18:42] sqradi: TOP vs JDG PogChamp
[0:18:47] cedentary: grats. ive been trying to learn the game. @.@
[0:19:05] Lev1athanGRE: Casting duos get great when u combine a guy that can talk fast enough and watch everything that happens all the game so he can talk and talk about it (Play by play caster) and an analyst (color caster) who will explain everything in the game and why it happened/will happen or should happen
[0:19:17] asuka4eva: i guess ss and jd will win
[0:19:33] realredgg: I want to go pro, i know its prolly not going to happen but that the only thing drives me in this live
[0:19:33] cedentary: blg jdg.
[0:19:44] cedentary: 2 1 and 2 0.
[0:19:59] cedentary: ill play a game with you but im only lvl 23 haha

[0:20:39] cedentary: jeeez.
[0:20:39] realredgg: with 782 mastery points lol
[0:21:01] Lev1athanGRE: Game knowledge= pallete/colors to paint a picture of the game to the audience(aka explain it)
[0:21:06] cedentary: sl
[0:21:10] realredgg: i got all champs at mastery 5 and higher i play a LOT
[0:21:24] cedentary: dang yeah i don't play a ton.
[0:21:40] C_LeeShedsBloodOfSaxonMen: Pepejam
[0:21:51] C_LeeShedsBloodOfSaxonMen: :(
[0:21:55] Lev1athanGRE: When casting in general started it was trough radio (so you could only hear) and the main reason was for the caster to explain what happened in the game perfectly
[0:21:59] cedentary: i
[0:22:14] realredgg: Neeko and Sylas believe it or not was easy to get to mastery 6
[0:22:17] cedentary: yeah like live sports broadcasting
[0:22:26] Lev1athanGRE: yes
[0:22:33] cedentary: im loving sylas xerath and lulu so far.
[0:22:48] cedentary: getting into jax too.
[0:22:55] realredgg: Lulu is really good
[0:23:20] cedentary: thats my support or mid if our team drafts a lame ass brand supp or something
[0:23:28] Lev1athanGRE: You play all champs/ waste time talking to twitch chat about what u like, and u wanna go pro, sry but the last one wants super dedication and precision
[0:23:38] realredgg: Brand support is awsome! idk what you mean
[0:23:46] Lev1athanGRE: If u use ur time like this u'll never get close to anything
[0:23:56] realredgg: i won like tons of games with brand support
[0:24:10] AnOldDinosaur: oof
[0:24:16] airopaque13: lpl lives
[0:24:17] cedentary: yeah its effective but lacks tools to bolster the adc which seems huge right now.
[0:24:39] realredgg: i got from hard stuck silver to gold in less then 30 days...
[0:24:54] Lev1athanGRE: thats nothing xD
[0:25:15] realredgg: i was plat too but lost it but i about to get it backi
[0:25:21] Lev1athanGRE: 90% of the pros where at least D5 in their first season (most D2+)
[0:25:25] realredgg: all this season
[0:25:35] cedentary: if you havent started umbrella academy hit it.
[0:25:41] Lev1athanGRE: u Understand that this is nothing right?
[0:25:44] realredgg: i have higher win rate then most grand masters
[0:25:51] Lev1athanGRE: @cedentary finished it today, amazing series
[0:26:02] Afro_Louis: china is noob?
[0:26:18] Lev1athanGRE: WoW so delusional.... GRANDMASTERS win vs fcking masters/grandmasters NOT VS SILVERs
[0:26:19] cedentary: most of these guys have like 110 ranked games a season. thats stupid dedication.
[0:26:28] cedentary: 1100*
[0:26:49] Lev1athanGRE: Why would something that can feed u be stupid?
[0:26:55] efka02: 4
[0:26:55] realredgg: im 71/48 on top and that after bad loss streak
[0:27:04] cedentary: actually i watched dl play a game vs 2 challengers 3 plats earlier.
[0:27:23] cedentary: riot gave up on balancing in na. china has more players so easier.
[0:27:27] realredgg: i have over 200 gmes this season
[0:27:35] Lev1athanGRE: @cedentary yeah ladder is cancer atm, pretty messed up, in Korea no pro plays soloq seriously atm
[0:27:45] Lev1athanGRE: they scrim like 10 hours per day

[0:33:06] cedentary: lms always has 3 good teams that bomb at worlds.
[0:33:21] Lev1athanGRE: J team plays better than everyone atm tho
[0:33:29] LaoWai42: you mean after they had just formed and ig had just won worlds?
[0:33:44] 1kenn1: EDG in 2k19 LUL
[0:33:44] cedentary: i want blakc and white skins so ill root for mad team if they do anything decent.

[0:38:04] cedentary: top three in that order for this split imo.
[0:38:11] Lev1athanGRE: @Laowai42 I was super hyped for TOP and actually still believe that if they find their identity they can dominate china with that same roster, but with their performance atm and the way they play they look just like a playoff team...
[0:38:32] HystericsCasts: If IG don't finish top 3 something will be seriously wrong, start of the split going to be very different to the end
[0:38:34] will_o_will: best eu mid is luka modric
[0:38:38] LaoWai42: being a playoff team makes them good imo
[0:38:47] gothscientist: xqcS
[0:39:06] 46娛樂台中分部部長: 想太多==
[0:39:08] Lev1athanGRE: They were already a playoff team :P with that roster they could be so much more lmfao
