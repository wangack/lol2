[5:43:50] LuluMango711: this lucian is painful to look at
[5:43:52] OnlyVixen: oh wow
[5:43:53] james7625: I think the only team who is able to beat teams like IG, G2, TOP, MSF, GRF is TSM. I think TSM with their new upgraded roster and coaching staff will have the potential to beat those teams in the end. It's all about bjergsen and zven here.
[5:44:09] Soldierhawkey: Huh

[5:45:39] tulkas_orome: 9.2 feels so bad
[5:45:42] halloderbaer: this guy is spamming on spanisch and gets tolerated, but my message that icon is toplane gets removed Kappa
[5:45:45] flatsh: TSM is going to win worlds, it‚Äôs simply the perfect mix between talent and NA determination.
[5:45:45] zezrmagetrekt: is that zven dude actually a top adc or nah i haven't really watched since i quit league after season 6

[5:48:59] MelOSquid: Look at that stats
[5:49:00] flatsh: Imports in NA have improved themselves in a much harder competition than EU or the LCK. Players like bjergsen and Zven are better than they ever were before. They are up there with uzi, rookie and faker.
[5:49:10] window7player: leesin damage poggers
[5:49:15] MelOSquid: There was a crazy gape
