[1:52:41] supermechacynpai: I've been maining her for years so its normally like 5/1
[1:52:42] YSZN: mala-maestro were the issues this match
[1:52:45] Kamehadouken_: Zoe is such a well balanced champ with just a ton of counter play options.
[1:52:59] Nibiria: @meteorb64 hey man you can, uhhh...ban...her?
[1:53:02] oompous: @Nibiria whats a "sun"?!
[1:53:09] Nibiria: honestly i've forgotten
[1:53:13] YSZN: @bgijy1 new midlane and somehow a complete loss of communication/chemistry
[1:53:22] bgijy1: ah
[1:53:25] Nibiria: i want to see snake run andy more
[1:53:26] Escapee1: viktor's win rate across all regions must be terrible
[1:53:30] Meshugunah: G2-8 OMEGALUL
[1:53:41] Nibiria: he was disappointing in his first series but he was proactive which is something that mala fails to be
[1:53:49] YSZN: andy was absolutely awful, bring gyu up from the LDL team
[1:54:08] Nibiria: i agree he wasn't great yszn but i think he would be better than mala with a little experience
[1:54:08] YSZN: gyu at least had a few decent games despite being worse than guoguo
[1:54:14] Nibiria: i've not seen gyu yet
[1:54:24] YSZN: gyu played last year
[1:54:27] linkinparkj: 스네이크가 못하는거 맞죠?
[1:54:35] Nibiria: 是吗？ monkaS
[1:54:53] Nibiria: maybe they just wanna try the players that haven't been on the big stage before
[1:55:13] supermechacynpai: Im real torn on how good EDG is rn, they looked so much better with clearlove but their side lane play in game 2 was shocking
[1:55:33] Nibiria: edg are better past 2 series than the entire split just via eye test
[1:55:42] KJTLX: fun plus
[1:55:44] supermechacynpai: 100%
[1:55:45] shiny_chocobo: Anyone see Aodi;s head omg hahahahaa
[1:55:47] YSZN: I'm moreso curious on what happened internally where they shipped guoguo off to omg's LDL team
[1:55:50] supermechacynpai: but where does that leave them?
[1:55:51] Nibiria: honestly i'm waiting for 2nd series today
[1:56:05] Vinder_Skygge: ^
[1:56:09] 포야: Rng top waiting ResidentSleeper
[1:56:15] Nibiria: i think edg will be top 8 but beyond that i don't want to commit to anything they're far too inconsistent
[1:56:15] Vinder_Skygge: Which team is the real best LPL team
[1:56:25] m0ydah: ig
[1:56:26] supermechacynpai: series 2 is just 'is condi good at league... if yes LGD win'
[1:56:31] Nibiria: FPX right now are looking the strongest especially after SNG's last few series
[1:56:33] YSZN: Griffin vs Top msi finals waiting room
[1:56:33] clay031: top
[1:56:35] Nibiria: imo at least
[1:56:42] Nibiria: ig are shaky right now FPX are at least consistent
[1:56:51] supermechacynpai: Jinoo going up against his old team is at least interesting
[1:56:52] Nibiria: with a big ol' asterisk where LGD are concerned
[1:56:56] Nibiria: hence why i'm excited for series 2
[1:57:06] Nibiria: i want to see LGD have a redemption arc
[1:57:08] flamazide: @Nibiria fpx being consistent is so crazy to me
[1:57:19] Nibiria: well they were consistent last split in a weird way
[1:57:22] YSZN: I really want chovy v knight to become a rivalry
[1:57:29] Nibiria: they were consistent in that you never knew what was happening
[1:57:42] Nibiria: i think between doinb and warhorse this split is looking much brighter
[1:57:45] chaserofchubs: the sun goes down BibleThump
[1:58:03] Nibiria: warhorse has given them some strategy and tempered them a bit and doinb gives them a strong leadership personality who can still maintain their chaotic style
[1:58:08] Nibiria: which is why they're so damn fun to watch
[1:58:14] 国人晓迪: PogChamp
[1:58:16] supermechacynpai: FPX styled on LGD in their last series by going 'lets just try something new we've never played before' then in game 3 stomped them wiht their usual playstyle
[1:58:27] dofthec: phew... rare to see chat so chill.. tis a good day to catch lpl live
[1:58:39] Zerek_Dable: Is it three game sets?
[1:58:40] Nibiria: FPX nearly lost game 1 and actually lost game 2
[1:58:47] Hamatayoshi: how come no one bans zoe?
[1:58:50] Nibiria: i think people are sleeping on LGD
[1:58:57] Nibiria: @Zerek_Dable yep! 3 bo3s today and tomorrow
[1:59:04] Nibiria: that will be our schedule every weekend going forward
[1:59:05] YSZN: I wish snake coach would stop trying to make sofm a team player. Bring soloq carry sofm back already.
[1:59:06] flamazide: @Zerek_Dable yes. that is why it starts early
[1:59:11] Zerek_Dable: Thanks @nibiria
[1:59:32] Nibiria: @YSZN i dunno i think he's actually been playing really well, do you disagree? he's got some really creative pathing done and put out a lot of pressure for his team
[1:59:36] clay031: Apparently Maple stopped knowing how to play the game after the Akali nerfs LUL
[1:59:37] supermechacynpai: like i said, they played a disengage comp to counter LGDs playstyle which theyd never done, rather than go for their classic mid jg rotate top with a skirmishing duo, game 3 they went back to that
[1:59:39] Nibiria: the problem is everyone else seems to fall apart around him
[1:59:46] 포야: 경기할때 우르르나옴

[2:00:33] Hydrophob: :)
[2:00:43] badonkaboots5: LUL
[2:00:55] YSZN: @Nibiria sofm's specialty in the past was his mechanical outplay and playing on the edge and more often than not coming out on top. There was a brief period last season under coach chris they enabled him during the funnel jg-mid strats
[2:00:58] 우후리여: 1SET MVP MID

[2:01:37] slimshadyjg: NaM
[2:01:42] Nibiria: @YSZN well my question then is how do they do that with the rest of the team playing how they are, i feel they genuinely have a good botlane worth enabling this season
[2:01:48] 雷諾瓦: MingLee
[2:01:52] snatchcannon: OMEGALUL
[2:01:57] Nibiria: and sofm can use his excellent on-the-fly pathing and mechanical ability to enable them
[2:01:59] danielfrombrazil3: SaltyFrosk RustyFace FeelsBadMan @Nibiria
[2:02:02] Nibiria: problem is midlane is MonkaS
[2:02:22] snatchcannon: CmonRaz
[2:02:40] Admiralcholo: Keepo
[2:03:18] chaserofchubs: Zoe gives me ebola
[2:03:19] hardenfull: i feel like solo laners are just losing a lot..
[2:03:20] 雷諾瓦: MingLee
[2:03:26] supermechacynpai: I mean, if their only win condition is 'top pops off enough for everyone else to benefit' then I think any change for snakes strategy is welcome
[2:03:29] shiny_chocobo: MingLee Clap
[2:03:46] dofthec: zoe NotLikeThis
[2:03:48] Nibiria: well right cyn that's what they've run before and now when they do well it's through their botlane instead of flandre
[2:04:01] Nibiria: i dont know if that's a positive for their botlane or an indictment of flandre, though
[2:04:09] 포야: Zoe Kappa
[2:04:30] dofthec: somehow i wanna see zoe in one for all, tho LUL

[2:05:08] Hydrophob: :)
[2:05:14] 雷諾瓦: HYPERBRUH ?
[2:05:36] supermechacynpai: Flandre hasnt been great, but the change to bot has been mostly just relying on asuras 3 item spikes coming before the opponents due to pressure rather than him showing any strength or champion mastery
[2:06:01] FK_P: vici gaming would probably win LCK
[2:06:07] FK_P: too good
[2:06:10] Killer_Lil_M: so what youre saying is sylas has a face that vi would love to practice punching?
[2:06:14] shiny_chocobo: Vici will win worlds

[2:08:08] YSZN: @supermechacynpai have them trade for rush and I'd agree

[2:32:46] zandelcorrin: @weird_bruh LCK is in a strange state right now... the top 3 teams look strong and are playing well, nest 3 seem decent and good enough to challenge the world but the last 4 seem worse than teams from LEC / LCS.
[2:32:48] lovenishimiya: LCK used to be no.1 , now LPL no.1
[2:32:55] clay031: @PotatoesInvasion RNG would've beat KT for sure and all evidence we have shows that they prob would've beat IG as well. The only reason G2 beat RNG was because they split pushed and RNG didn't know what to do

[2:34:37] 47smokes: jin air will win worlds
[2:34:41] ShadowZH: @Escapee1 but u have to think that winning worlds is the best way to profit
[2:34:49] PotatoesInvasion: as a region lpl probably the strongest right now, but griffin still the strongest team right now
[2:34:52] freeko: remember, you are only as good as your weakest link and JAG is really bad

[2:35:28] clay031: @MaggoGx what about Rift Rivals EU vs. NA Pepega Clap
[2:35:29] Nibiria: 谢谢KFC
[2:35:30] sgburger: Jin Air would probably stomp on top 4 NA / EU teams.

Watch any of their games and check out their stats and they are second to none. But hey i'm just looking at the evidence and facts before me, I must be wrong because proof is not enough.
[2:46:13] WinRAR_Buyer: @Hnbl10 GRF plays like an LPL team and aren't afraid to try new strats. They can definitely compete with top LPL teams

[2:46:58] PaxPerMortis: GRF is the best team KR, for sure. But there's a lot more competition now than just the "Korean Overlords" meme that we've had for 4 seasons up to last year. They're having to build and adapt on the same level as other regions. They're strong domestically yeah, but until the first international competition I'm really hesistant to call them best in the world.

It was unfortunate that they lost the summer finals (its also the last time I believe GRF lost a match in the regional finals last season?)

[2:49:28] hardenfull: still LUL
[2:49:28] hnbl10: @KennyFlowBlow yes Ive watched all their games and I know they can play aggro but it doesn't mean they play like LPL teams, their macro is lacking and they are playing vs much weaker teams than in LPL
[2:49:30] fast_turtle15: Report mid
[2:49:31] kanz19: 5.8 LISS LUL
[2:49:34] 포야: 걍 둘이 근거없이 헛소리 하는중이니 차단하셈
[2:49:38] ANordicRaven: LEC actually looks relatively strong to be honest, even if they dont have the "strongest team"
[2:49:45] clay031: Kennen low dmg OMEGALUL
[2:49:45] ShadowZH: @zandelcorrin yes but the fact that they didnt even get to worlds simply weighs more than OH THEY DID GOOD IN SCRIMS

[2:49:49] poside99: @zandelcorrin scrim records don't mean jack shit if you don't translate them to stage games tho
[2:49:54] zandelcorrin: @shadowzh Agreed it wasn't on stage and that is different but they will prove that this year for sure.
[2:49:59] Clairfoyance: @ANordicRaven G2??? LUL
[2:49:59] WinRAR_Buyer: @Hnbl10 sorry meant to say pm me
[2:50:06] shiny_chocobo: This is why Reapered is a coach and I’m not xd
[2:50:10] balde_runner: TSM IS GOOD IN SCRIM TOO LUL
[2:50:12] firefire1914: lck같으면 지는데에 타당한이유가있는데 이건 그냥 답이없어요
[2:50:13] datpiff4: the real question is na or eu?
[2:50:21] VirtualInsanity_: missed game 1, did vg play well?
[2:50:28] Nibiria: also fun fact shanghai has an official Cherry keyboard store and it's freaking sweet
[2:50:31] zandelcorrin: @helneken On their own they mean nothing, when the team is now playing better than everyone else in all games, it means a lot.
[2:50:32] clay031: LEC looks too Pepega for me to think they're better than NA but we'll see as the year goes on
[2:50:32] sgburger: This LCK vs LPL argument can go on forever but that doesn't change the fact that Griffin will most likely cruise through Worlds with ease
[2:50:34] YSZN: mala is prone to tilt/feed, the game goes fine if he doesn't do his usualy antics. Still gyu>mala
[2:50:36] lovenishimiya: LCK fan logic, GRF undefeated they are best team
[2:50:38] 호우넛: ?
[2:50:42] firefire1914: 잘하고못하고의문제가아니라 데체 저건머지?의혹이 들게만드는 경기력이에요
[2:50:46] ANordicRaven: @Lofi_Chill Nah, I mean the overall strength of all the teams. I watch all regions. LCK is eh except for GRF and Sandbox. LPL and LEC are pretty close in strength of overall region
[2:50:46] ShadowZH: @zandelcorrin yeah but before they prove it u cant just say grf is the best team, because u have ig that hasnt changed, which has proven that they can fight against the best in the world
[2:50:48] lovenishimiya: so I can say FPX is currently the best team in the world
[2:51:00] ShadowZH: but again i do agree that grf is def one of the best in the worlds
[2:51:00] datpiff4: sgburger what is griffin
[2:51:01] sqradi: LUL
[2:51:05] Clairfoyance: @ANordicRaven nope, G2 is still best by a margin

[2:51:16] freeko: I for one cannot wait for MSI where we get to see where GRF really stand on the world stage
[2:51:23] VirtualInsanity_: on Current form I think Doinb is the best player in the world noKapp

[2:51:31] Clairfoyance: RNG vs TOP waiting room ResidentSleeper
[2:51:32] ANordicRaven: @Lofi_Chill True, but they can be contested by other teams. Its not as gross as GRF vs other LCK teams
[2:51:36] LmaoLp: sword tarzan chovy viper lehends
[2:51:52] lovenishimiya: FPX best team in the world according to LCK fans logic
[2:51:53] Korrikai: DoinB is nasty
[2:51:56] Clairfoyance: @ANordicRaven but it is tho, they just won S04 yesterday in like 25 min
[2:51:56] freeko: Chovy, Tarzan, Viper, Lehends and Sword
[2:51:56] firefire1914: 암튼 중국리그는 조작아니고서는 설명되지않아요
[2:52:07] clay031: KR as a whole definitely looks weaker this year than they have in the past, they split up the good players a lot and some of them went to other regions
[2:52:07] hentailover12345: RNG vs TOP waiting room ResidentSleeper
[2:52:07] 포야: 걍 이상한애들 차단하면 깨끗

[2:52:27] sqradi: LGD vs V5 waiting room ResidentSleeper
[2:52:39] Clairfoyance: @ANordicRaven any1 can lose bo1, even GRF lost 1 game, still won the bo3, G2 wouldve won bo3
[2:52:44] freeko: I watch LMS, even though its a dead region now
[2:52:44] SayoriNo1Doki: BO2 or BO3 guys?
[2:52:49] clay031: Lehends got rank1 KR last year by one tricking Singed top OMEGALUL
[2:52:54] oompous: LMS LUL
[2:52:56] ANordicRaven: Don't get me wrong, G2 is strong, but they arent as dominant in their region as GRF is. Thats why Im saying LEC is a stronger overall region than LCK. The other LCK teams are hot garbage.
[2:52:58] kekwitch: Actually fpx is world best now
[2:53:02] hardenfull: KR look weaker cause gameplay is now more aggressive and less vision. They don't have as much control as before
[2:53:03] PaxPerMortis: @lovenishimiya If we're going purely on domestic records then you'd be right, which is why I think "wait till MSI before you smack-talk" and go by *tentative* power rankings is a smarter bet. There's some really strong contenders globally now, and things have kinda turned sideways without any international evidence right now.
[2:53:03] lovenishimiya: VCS = Venezuela league?
[2:53:06] sherlockd3: ez clap
[2:53:12] freeko: vietnam
[2:53:13] hardenfull: VCS = Vietnam
[2:53:26] hardenfull: anyone think VCS could beat NA?
[2:53:28] Scumbagnoob: lmao only hot garbage team in LCK is jin air
[2:53:32] Clairfoyance: @ANordicRaven nah LCK has SB/SKT/DWG who are all decent
[2:53:41] womboboys: Fake BLUR song PogChamp
[2:53:44] Ep0l4s: SourPls
[2:53:46] lmcdo: KT is pretty bad too lol
[2:53:49] sgburger: Jin Air would stomp on most NA / EU teams LUL
[2:53:51] freeko: no, VCS and LMS now are just wildcard regions
[2:53:59] Scumbagnoob: EU top 4 looks good but the rest is actually hot garbage
[2:54:01] clay031: LCK > LPL/NA >EU
[2:54:10] ANordicRaven: IMO, strongest teams are like Top Five LPL = GRF = G2 > Sandbox, Schalke04, TL, Origen, Splyce, Fnatic > everyone else
[2:54:11] GummiGrim: Didn't they give VCS their own Worlds spot though?
[2:54:20] Clairfoyance: counting out LMS again LUL watch them get out of grps over NA at MSI LUL
[2:54:22] lovenishimiya: @aqnguyen96 not yet.... VCS is still miles behind the major regions
[2:54:25] lmcdo: JAG is worse than most NA/EU teams, but by most I mean they'd beat bottom 4
[2:54:30] hardenfull: VCS gonna overtake LMS in my opinion
[2:54:30] sherlockd3: every regions can beat NA PogChamp
[2:54:39] freeko: I favor Damwon over Sandbox as second best LCK team imho
[2:54:41] kekwitch: decent? have you really seen lck games? THEY LOST AGAINST GOLDENGUARDEAN-LEVE TEAM
[2:54:42] burnswin: they already have @aqnguyen96
[2:54:51] sgburger: NA teams are not bad at all but they just choke way too often on world stage
[2:54:54] ANordicRaven: @freeko Possible, Damwon isnt as consistent though
[2:54:54] hardenfull: honestly no one watches vcs cause no english cast LUL
[2:54:57] clay031: @Lofi_Chill Ok but FW has been on or higher than the level of EU and NA for years
[2:54:58] Clairfoyance: @freeko SKT??? LUL
[2:54:59] LEAGUEOFSCRIPTED: all these predictions when TSM gonna win anyway FailFish
[2:55:01] Scumbagnoob: the fact that you left out damwon and skt is appalling

[2:55:06] clay031: @Lofi_Chill now they aren't a thing
[2:55:08] Pillsbury_Doughboy: im ready
[2:55:09] lovenishimiya: @aqnguyen96 we'll see, but LMS has been quite disappointing in recent years, maybe VCS could be the next LMS
[2:55:09] lmcdo: @weird_bruh FW lost literally everyone

[2:55:25] Clairfoyance: @weird_bruh they could be LUL
[2:55:25] ANordicRaven: Damwon and SKT cant be placed by me due to being inconsistent and getting dunked SO hard by GRF.
[2:55:34] PreacherCasts: POGGERS
[2:55:37] burnswin: honestly TSM will win worlds, you peasants think they wont LMFAO
[2:55:39] freeko: SKT is like 3-4th best, not sure between them or sandbox in those two spots
[2:55:41] sgburger: Because GRF is that good?
[2:55:41] Scumbagnoob: and yet you have fnatic in there? jesus what is this logic
[2:55:42] hardenfull: Anyone here think turkey or russia can make it to top 6 LUL
[2:55:43] Clairfoyance: @weird_bruh last year, no1 expected FW to be tis gd at MSI
[2:55:50] I_Love_You_Chat: 😡 play do-do sin 😡
[2:55:52] clay031: @lmcdo they made MSI Semis multiple times, Worlds quarters multiple times, got several wins over Korean teams
[2:55:53] rebeccamo: are you ready? FeelsGoodMan
[2:55:57] ANordicRaven: SKT is 2-3rd best only in LCK
[2:55:57] hazard1905: dreyPepega
[2:56:00] Scumbagnoob: fnatic legit looked lost af until last 2-3 games
[2:56:05] freeko: GRF is clearly 1, then I have DWG, SB, SKT
[2:56:08] lmcdo: @weird_bruh "they" are all on LPL teams now dude
[2:56:10] ANordicRaven: I think they could easily lose to any top LPL team or G2
[2:56:11] YourKidnies: @aqnguyen96 did you forget about what was it season six?
[2:56:24] clay031: @Lofi_Chill yeah but it's hard to tell because the rest of LMS is basically OCE
[2:56:37] ANordicRaven: SKT is kinda stuck in last season
[2:56:40] Clairfoyance: @weird_bruh tats wat we've been saying for years LUL
[2:56:42] kekwitch: @anordicraven true
[2:56:44] freeko: SKT lost too much talent and has not replaced it properly
[2:56:46] poside99: @freeko what about damwon makes u rate them so highly. Seem like a really inconsistent team to me. Genuine curious
[2:56:46] mazezhong1994: ResidentSleeper
[2:56:46] ANordicRaven: Theyre still playing too passive, Faker barely started playing carries again
[2:56:52] sgburger: SKT lost too many key players
[2:56:56] lmcdo: SKT should honestly play Crazy and ignore topside
[2:57:01] clay031: @lmcdo Karsa, Maple, and SwordArt are all in LPL and Moojin is in KR
[2:57:03] ANordicRaven: Damwon is a great team, but they have really high highs and really low lows
[2:57:06] Gojusco: LCK is bad now
[2:57:07] mazezhong1994: VG vs SS NotLikeThis ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[2:57:45] hardenfull: J team winning TL LUL
[2:57:45] sgburger: LCK isn't bad NotLikeThis It is just GRF's too good.
[2:57:49] ANordicRaven: I dont think theyre better than G2, GRF, or top five LPL

[2:57:54] ANordicRaven: At all
[2:58:02] djjohnnymelster: also koala

[2:58:18] hardenfull: OCE DIREWOLVES LUL
[2:58:19] kekwitch: @sumosan3 inconsistent? consistently low they are... think which teams they have beaten...really lower teams only
[2:58:28] Bakuryu_II: @bunkest_ twitch is NOT lpl main broadcast platform
[2:58:33] freeko: I think DWG given the time to grow has the ability and talent to be a major LCK player. you can fix the mistakes you make and learn from them, which is what I expect a young team to do
[2:58:36] rebeccamo: @Fullmute_Allchemist quite sure most here dont know about dodosin
[2:58:37] ANordicRaven: I think theyre even with 2-4th place EU teams and TL
[2:58:42] Clairfoyance: LCK won 5 of the 7 worlds they've attended and suddenly they're trash tier region cuz of 1 worlds performance LUL
[2:58:43] Zacokk: scarra FeelsGoodMan
[2:58:44] ANordicRaven: On a good day for them

[2:59:33] Scumbagnoob: anything but that they get dunked instead lmao
[2:59:34] poside99: I feel damwons bot lane is not good enough to contest for top 2 or maybe even 3 imo
[2:59:35] ANordicRaven: I think theyre both just as inconsistent
[2:59:45] ANordicRaven: ^ this is the problem
[2:59:47] freeko: Some regions only have one or maybe two legitimate teams

[3:03:00] freeko: ooh, sandbox vs kingzone
[3:03:01] poside99: Jin Air is appallingly bad, would only be bottom half in NA
[3:03:07] ANordicRaven: @zacokk A random team of masters would beat Jin Air, they dont even try. Even bronze players would get some kills and int into the enemy team
[3:03:09] hardenfull: Tsm will smurf soon. Their wraith will be swift. All these pleasants thinking we aren't good Lmao LUL
[3:03:17] sgburger: The problem with Jin Air is they are not adapting well to the meta
[3:03:18] Vinder_Skygge: LCK has a good match rn
[3:03:23] PaxPerMortis: @ariesanity I think it's because the community is so used to KR being so dominant in previous seasons, seeing a Worlds where KR isn't there skewed people's perceptions. They are beatable, which is what the international scene has been working to prove. They're on a relatively even level again, so it's up in the air I think.
[3:03:28] freeko: kingzone will win because sandbox have not adapted to the meta yet I think
[3:03:33] ANordicRaven: Jin air has mental boom, they just roll over and die
[3:03:50] Clairfoyance: 1 more rookie Korean team into LCK since jin air is beyond trash FeelsGoodMan
[3:04:01] Zacokk: @ANordicRaven Jin Air or Rogue before changes, stoppable force vs movable object LUL
[3:04:02] ANordicRaven: Yes please, bring up a challenger team
[3:04:07] BettingDegen: the problem with Jin Air is more than one problem deeply rooted. they need to disband, they'd get smashed in challenger Korea too
[3:04:11] freeko: LCK was stuck in the rut of the "old ways" which are not as effective
[3:04:13] ANordicRaven: @zacokk Holy shit haha
[3:04:23] ANordicRaven: Incoming 200 minute late game
[3:04:29] poside99: Jin Air always seems to win promos tho. Would be super tilting if they somehow stayed in summer
[3:04:30] BettingDegen: jin air legit don't do anything the entire game and let you take everything
[3:04:31] freeko: the LCK brings up challenger teams and they are the ones holding court in LCK
[3:04:47] sgburger: Jin Air is just not playing well in the current meta. They will be back on track next year
[3:04:52] BettingDegen: they're like bbq Olivers last year but twice as bad
[3:04:53] LEAGUEOFSCRIPTED: 1-4 vs 1-5 LLUL

[3:13:17] Nibiria: @dfsafdfdasf patches for LPL go through government approval before they go live. this time the LPL opted to skip 9.3, we will be back to parity on 9.4
[3:13:18] window7player: I tried sylas sp several games and it is pretty decent...i have the most damage and kills sometimes

[3:14:22] I_Love_You_Chat: @fat_ratt to make sure Riot doesnt release any winnie the pooh skins :)
[3:14:23] PaxPerMortis: @Nibiria Is that due to the difference of Garena vs. Riot, or just gov't sponsorship/control?
[3:14:44] Nibiria: @paxpermortis all games and their patches have to go through approval from the ministry of culture here in china before they are published

[3:16:19] dfsafdfdasf: old akali is fking broken
[3:16:23] dfsafdfdasf: 9.2*
[3:16:39] h011ywood: does half of china even have computers Kappa
[3:16:51] pleasestopracism: camille is still nerfed, and akali is kinda hit or miss tbh
[3:16:52] PaxPerMortis: @dfsafdfdasf It's only broken if they can execute and get advantages to snowball
[3:17:03] Clairfoyance: @allmynamesrtaken 4 billion? LUL
[3:17:13] dfsafdfdasf: they are just playing bad..
[3:17:17] dfsafdfdasf: :)
[3:17:20] h011ywood: its another shoah
[3:17:21] pleasestopracism: in LPL 'usually' the easier to excecute comp is the better one. and snake have it.
[3:17:24] I_Love_You_Chat: it should be simple for them to shove bot then dive with galio taunt and camille ult no
[3:17:33] sherlockd3: ADC cs
[3:17:36] LaoWai42: @h011ywood no they do not but that is why pc bars are so popular as well as mobile gaming being insanely popular in china
[3:17:40] kremlingremlins: Only way Vg wins this is if their adc snowballs far enough
[3:18:26] kremlingremlins: poppy has to go bot
[3:18:32] kremlingremlins: its frozen
[3:18:49] kremlingremlins: so everyone will be bot

[3:18:58] Nibiria: asura down 40 cs that's a big monka

[3:19:14] kremlingremlins: this is bad
[3:19:25] dfsafdfdasf: lucian is the saving grace
[3:19:29] PaxPerMortis: @dfsafdfdasf It's not a "bad comp" on paper, but it's not working for VG right now so for them at least it's not great. R-button comps are easier to execute and a lot more reliable than relying on perfect execution.
[3:19:47] rebeccamo: asura was good in his first few games FailFish

[3:23:42] Deflatedpillow: is stormrazor kaisa the new thing? i thought it was really bad on her now?

[3:24:12] Deflatedpillow: @Nibiria oh wow lol. ty
[3:24:17] Nibiria: but you are correct
[3:24:17] Locarno: How come everyone else is playing 9.3?
[3:24:22] Nibiria: stormrazor first on 9.3 would be GARBO
[3:24:37] kremlingremlins: imagine if botlane just went even... this woud be over
[3:24:39] dfsafdfdasf: lucian hard carrying
[3:24:46] itsbopbop: vg bot smurfing
[3:24:51] pajzon1996zgg: omg ss lose
[3:24:58] Nibiria: @Locarno every game and patch in china has to go through government approval, LPL opted to not go for approval process for 9.3 since it coincided with chinese new year (national holiday)
[3:25:07] pleasestopracism: sofm build? going redemption ?
[3:25:11] Nibiria: they will be caught up for 9.4
[3:25:21] itsbopbop: I love akali BibleThump I wish they didnt kill her
[3:25:30] merewif_: wow lpl is so weird
[3:25:35] Locarno: Do you think it gives the players playing 9.2 a disadvantage in long run?
[3:25:45] Duranchilla: does lpl do best of 3?
[3:25:47] Deflatedpillow: @Nibiria thats interesting, i didnt know about all that government apporoval
[3:25:49] Locarno: Cos, everyone else would of played 9.3 for x amount of time
[3:25:51] dfsafdfdasf: its just 1 week of play
[3:25:56] dfsafdfdasf: on a behind patch
[3:26:07] Nibiria: maybe slightly, but since they will be on parity for most if not all of the rest of the split i don't think it'll have much of an effect
[3:26:13] itsbopbop: @Locarno it wont matter once they catch up
[3:26:16] kremlingremlins: if snake plays it right they can farm till late nd win
[3:26:22] PaxPerMortis: @itsbopbop They stated they wanted to nerf her to the ground so they could tune her back up slowly to bring her power to parity. Whether they will or not Kappa
[3:26:29] NoSopaForYou: 9.2 akali LUL
[3:26:30] kanz19: AKALI ResidentSleeper
[3:26:39] Nibiria: a lot of the changes on 9.3 re: ADC are essentially "remember how this item used to be, it's that again" which helps speed of adaptation
[3:26:44] hardenfull: asura LUL
[3:26:53] h011ywood: akali has gunblade...time to dominate

[3:27:32] kremlingremlins: what a bad macro
[3:27:33] merewif_: 9.3 is 8.11 all over again
[3:27:42] Nibiria: both these teams have pretty bad mid-late macro imo
[3:27:45] hardenfull: ik wtf asura was so far down
[3:27:48] PaxPerMortis: @itsbopbop I don't keep up with PBE, got a tl:dr?
[3:27:57] Nibiria: so it favors snake if they survive early
[3:28:16] Nibiria: asura is still super far behind

[3:29:41] Pepega_IRL: @NorthWestWolff lol
[3:30:16] sherlockd3: try to catch sion
[3:30:24] PaxPerMortis: @itsbopbop I suppose I'll look at it, the "true stealth" from towers BS was her biggest problem TBH
[3:30:30] kremlingremlins: these TPs are just pleasantries.... Both teams know there are no kills to get but they have to tp or the other team will win the fight
[3:30:31] skotyb6: agrWeird resttWUT

[3:31:30] pleasestopracism: @zarafruustra i dont think VG can force it, lucian doesnt do much dmg to i and snake just wait
[3:31:30] peytontherunningback1: I thought snake was a pretty good team?
[3:31:47] kremlingremlins: bautiful, kaisa catches up so much now

[3:32:27] Nibiria: @LucyeoN southwind is usually 90% of the team tho
[3:32:34] Nibiria: dude's insane
[3:32:48] PaxPerMortis: If Snake keeps getting solo farm and exp onto Asura it's gonna be real rough for Vici by 25-30
[3:32:53] RavenAuditore: can puff carry Vici
[3:32:55] pleasestopracism: puff + southwind on v5 Kreygasm
[3:33:02] kremlingremlins: If Vg dont use their dive comp to perfection and catch out a squishy then i dont think its winnable
[3:33:20] pleasestopracism: even gold for kaisa + vlad LuL
[3:33:34] LucyeoN: this game pretty dead
[3:33:34] QingXai: wait kaisa has stormrazor? O.o
[3:33:49] kremlingremlins: top is 60 cs above
[3:33:50] LucyeoN: lucian will get blown up by vlad and kaisa later
[3:33:54] kremlingremlins: adc is 50
[3:33:55] PaxPerMortis: @pwnerofkings They're still on 9.2, Stormrazor is still good first item
[3:33:56] itsbopbop: @pwnerofkings 9.2 patch
[3:33:59] RavenAuditore: power spike for lucian, VG should try something now
[3:33:59] kremlingremlins: mid is 30
[3:34:01] QingXai: ah phew
[3:34:17] pleasestopracism: redemption poppy 🤔
[3:34:20] kremlingremlins: Vg are trying but all snake is doing is neutralising
[3:34:36] pleasestopracism: sion going to just stand there while the rest of his team dies :)
[3:34:53] kremlingremlins: And Vg can only pressure from lucian cause hes their only strong point

[3:41:58] 만두보이: He doesn't even need zhonyas he needs to alistar to get his finger out of his own ass and simply headbutt the camille
[3:42:05] RavenAuditore: lucian couldnt find a position to do damage

[4:30:39] Lolzoez: kitteh99 LPL is the chinese league
[4:30:44] kremlingremlins: with reaver + dd + bt + cdr boots, riven can splitpush and literally ignore sion damage while she hits towers

[4:35:39] kitteh99: they should buff his spawn time
[4:35:43] Diniz_obrabo: EU SOU BR BROW
[4:35:54] il_irredento: eh.. no. they will win before it matters, but he would be unkillable in a hypothetical late game situation
[4:36:13] shiny_chocobo: AP gragas wont do shot to Sion when it’s like 50 mins lol
[4:36:24] menaaaaa: and camile late game gonna be a monster

[5:09:59] Giorno1: SoBayed
[5:10:00] bameylol: kindred and riven ban`? can someone explain that to me?
[5:10:01] MegamanBXR: I came from LCK because someone said it was lit over here
[5:10:05] nomegalulrth: Urgot has cool lore as well, but the overuse of him makes me hate him
[5:10:06] nittecera: @freeko That's what I said, SB had the meta on their side and the only reason they beat SKT was SKT not adjusting to their new teammates
[5:10:06] kitteh99: so nate
[5:10:09] YSZN: ley? where is everyones favorite troll road???

[5:12:43] djchefboyardee: Game 2
[5:12:45] nomegalulrth: LCK without GRF and SKT may be better than NA
[5:12:49] Todgins: wait 1 game in 2 hours?
[5:12:51] f0x_s0n1c: LCK is more attractiv, but the level in LPL is better

[5:13:25] nittecera: @f0x_s0n1c LPL > LCK but GRF > LPL
[5:13:32] nomegalulrth: No LPL is more entertaining in every way. If your not watching GRF or SKT chances are your watching KR fiesta

[5:15:31] rajkos2: i think its worth for lgd
[5:15:36] nittecera: @supercharlie They didn't get to worlds because they lost to KT 3-2 at summer finals, they are way better now
[5:15:41] rajkos2: cuz ashe needs R to kil kalista
[5:15:41] f0x_s0n1c: although i think they will win MSI if they send Griffin
