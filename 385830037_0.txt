[1:23:02] HystericsCasts: Cass outranges with twin fang
[1:23:05] raytsumateus: my dreanm
[1:23:13] emoteonlyxD: 2Heads
[1:23:14] HystericsCasts: so Cassio definitely has the easy push, kalista does not win this matchup
[1:23:17] nomegalulrth: It is faster probably but the players in LEC are vastly inferior so they just steamroll from minute 1
[1:23:21] kavalierAndClay: @FK_P kalista is bad against cassio because of her W. it counters kalista passive
[1:23:21] russianbot030: galio could engage on her to set up kalista

[2:54:22] Karuaan: Sivir wins late
[2:54:32] Endrju_Golara: 10 ADS DansGame

[2:55:40] Karuaan: @93reddan key point late game
[2:55:42] koneella: sivir never wins in lane, she wins games though
[2:55:53] chrisrox22: @93reddan i think sivir but it also depends on team comps
[2:55:56] itsbopbop: this chat is such a different dynamic than the lck chat lmao
[2:56:01] Karuaan: SIvir > kaisa late
[2:56:08] edgelordweeb: yeah lck chat is awful
[2:56:08] Omoikane27: Even 5th place LPL adc would smurf in LCK
[2:56:22] chrisrox22: 6 item sivir is generally stronger
[2:56:26] RifleEU: @koneella you're wrong, as a gm ad main, sivir out lush every ad and
[2:56:34] edgelordweeb: when lck chat starts flooding into lpl chat after lck finishes early that's when you turn off chat
[2:56:36] Karuaan: sivir is also a TF adc
[2:56:37] RifleEU: can use pressure to win
[2:56:43] 1kenn1: twitch > any adc late lmfao
[2:56:45] Karuaan: while kaisa is more of a pick and burst adc

[2:57:31] RifleEU: maybe kog too
[2:57:38] 1kenn1: sivir useless early
[2:57:40] Karuaan: yes she is
[2:57:50] RifleEU: @93reddan mid definitely
[2:57:51] FK_P: IG outlanes every team in the world, except TSM

[2:58:11] chrisrox22: sivir lane is fine
[2:58:16] Karuaan: 1 q + w = lane pushed

[3:03:52] kekwitch: Q: bot bruisers/casters like yasuo/bladimir/irelia possible in 9.4 patch?
[3:04:05] Karuaan: @93reddan Rekless is mad overrated as an ADC cause he can only play a few late game adcs. He was so passive on lucian vs a ashe in lane and was farming side lanes and split pushing. FNC only won cause the other team threw at the end.

[3:53:07] pan_de_molde_con_queso: owo
[3:53:09] Nibiria: i think they've honestly looked the most consistent out of the teams here in the LPL
[3:53:16] Nibiria: TOP as well, at least as of late
[3:53:20] Alpha1thegamer: true true
[3:53:27] kekwitch: Truth is that LPL teams are strongest
[3:53:39] Nibiria: that's the matchup i'm looking forward to during playoffs at least, i can't imagine either of those teams will miss them
[3:53:44] rooniethefroggie: TOP's played with the highest ceiling so far, FPX hasnt dropped the ball
[3:53:44] Bad_Woofer: are we in break?
[3:53:49] chx130423: FPX only played aginst weak teams
[3:53:49] kekwitch: but I want to see any Lec or Lcs team winning
[3:54:08] chx130423: G2 may have chance?
[3:54:10] kekwitch: Especially by Backdooring LUL
[3:54:14] chx130423: not sure
[3:54:25] Alpha1thegamer: well korea was really pissed last year so im postitve their going all out this year

[3:55:40] kekwitch: Western teams did not win the world for 7 years? I think? and it makes me so sad
[3:55:43] chx130423: SKT does not dominate rn
[3:55:44] Alpha1thegamer: hey guys it was nice discussing this w/ ya. I gotta go so have a lovely day to all

[4:12:19] Arbutus__unedo: now that's strange
[4:12:22] Luxiuz: No ad blocker
[4:12:25] Beetrayn: and do a barrel roll
[4:12:26] Luxiuz: I accepted cookies
[4:12:35] kekwitch: is sylas so OP? I think he needs so much high inteligence in teamfight although he's good in lane
[4:12:48] Meikai: My client showed that i were login, even tho i wasn't.
[4:12:52] Arbutus__unedo: Not really
[4:12:54] bonchnifkin: Just play it in the background while you play. It works every time
[4:12:58] kekwitch: maybe they can as they are pro...

[4:13:02] Arbutus__unedo: He requires consistency iirc
[4:13:03] ichrasieremaeuse: i had to refrsh like 10 times to get the bonus going
[4:13:07] Arbutus__unedo: It's ok dude
[4:13:10] ichrasieremaeuse: also no adblock and cookies on

[4:13:37] Luxiuz: @Meikai - in LoL client or Twitch?
[4:13:42] Arbutus__unedo: to be fair even if there's a Turkish channel for foreign leagues I would still watch English ones
[4:13:54] Meikai: In website
[4:14:03] Gyunol: double words
[4:14:09] Arbutus__unedo: Not having the best casters over there
[4:14:12] kekwitch: Skarner? are you sure?

[4:15:29] window7player: sylas is about stealing the ult and use it appropriately
[4:15:43] window7player: esp teamfights
[4:15:46] ichrasieremaeuse: yea, but why wouldnt u pic ka champ with a good ult then. most champs have a better q-w-e anyways

[5:20:37] poppybuster: yeah
[5:20:38] kekwitch: Did Caps won against uzi or uzi just failed to go to the 1v1 final?
[5:20:41] lisciastylisc: thats why i like Caps more
[5:20:45] Khrown_: wow
[5:20:46] poppybuster: Caps is best
[5:20:49] poppybuster: vayne mid
[5:20:51] poppybuster: kayn mid
[5:20:58] poppybuster: nothing more
[5:21:03] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Caps beat uzi 1v1 and won the tournament. This is the year of caps.
[5:21:10] sundownser: does anything else rhyme
[5:21:14] rebeccamo: uzi washed up already FailFish
[5:21:14] sundownser: cause hed be best at that too

[5:21:36] kekwitch: what champ caps picked?
[5:21:36] poppybuster: destroying
[5:21:40] lisciastylisc: g2 vs griffin final
[5:21:41] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Griffin would be middle of the pack in LPL
[5:21:41] lisciastylisc: i believe
[5:21:46] poppybuster: i donno
[5:21:48] AQWARDturtle: share the slime BrainSlug to help C9 share the slime BrainSlug to help C9 share the slime BrainSlug to help C9

[5:21:58] dicco43: @Olgon_MingLee nice joke
[5:22:02] poppybuster: Only G2 lul
[5:22:13] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: RNG is undefeated in scrims against Grf
[5:22:17] sundownser: wheres my life
[5:22:21] lisciastylisc: I love g2's youtube content
[5:22:24] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: This tells you the powerlevel of LPL
[5:22:29] Zixias: same
[5:22:35] vladikkeil1234: yes
[5:22:39] righthere33: top 2-0 FPX ez SeemsGood
[5:22:44] kekwitch: LPL is better than LCK, but scrims says nothing
[5:22:46] lisciastylisc: Jankos is from my country so he is my fav player ;P
[5:22:58] Zixias: wheres my support shaco
[5:23:01] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: GRF are only scrimming LPL teams and resulted in being 1st place in LCK easily undefeated.
[5:23:02] dicco43: you are from uganda?
[5:23:04] kekwitch: LPL is stronger as they have many strong teams, not because they win many scrim
[5:23:19] lisciastylisc: European Uganda
[5:23:27] dicco43: hhahaha :D
[5:23:45] lisciastylisc: but I dont live there anymore anyway :P
[5:23:47] Zixias: anyone think theres a legit chance that Asians are better because they have nimbler fingers?
[5:23:56] kekwitch: last year they also scrimmed with LPL, but lost against KT/GEN... scrims usually tells wrong information
[5:23:57] dicco43: XD
[5:23:58] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Funplus would make griffin look like XL tier
[5:24:03] izeabel: lol
[5:24:04] lisciastylisc: no, they aren't really better
[5:24:19] Zixias: ik but the reactions of some of them I swear
[5:24:22] kekwitch: LPL teams are stronger as they have REAL GAMES each other, not scrim.
[5:24:33] shiny_chocobo: From ll the years of piano playing LUL
[5:24:33] lisciastylisc: they might be sometimes better because they have average higher IQ
[5:24:36] Zixias: tru
[5:24:45] hexzoner: 323 Kappa
[5:24:45] Cyha: Sup chat
