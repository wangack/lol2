[0:08:19] PatMaweeny: @NightsLament you think they will be able to make it to msi?
[0:08:31] LaoWai42: just pure unadulterated young talent facing off
[0:08:46] PatMaweeny: didnt ig beat top?
[0:08:52] LaoWai42: in week 1
[0:09:08] sqradi: IG vs SN seemed poggers a week ago but not as poggers anymore LUL
[0:09:21] LaoWai42: also its so hard to tell who is the best team in the lpl right now have you looked at the standings its a true brawl

[1:07:43] fast_turtle15: Riven is 1 reason Damwon beat SKT lol
[1:07:44] Nibiria: im saying that if he's pulling those plays off generally you shouldn't be blaming him for the losses when they get to that point in the game -- leading up to that, you can blame him for a bot lane deficit. when he's pulling more than his weight in the later teamfights i dont think it's fair to say he's the sole issue or even a major issue, because he's one of 5 members
[1:07:51] Quakkulol: jag is worse

[2:23:18] Nibiria: Reasoning on 9.2: All games in China must go through an approval process with China's Ministry of Culture. 9.3's release coincided with Chinese New Year, a national holiday lasting over a week. As such, the LPL decided to skip the approval process for 9.3, and will be back on parity for 9.4.

[2:25:13] Nibiria: @Tede2010 yeah, all games and patches in china go through government approval. the holiday would have meant the players would have to practice a new patch instead of celebrating with their families plus the governmental body associated with the patch approval wouldn't be back until after the holiday
