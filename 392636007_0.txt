[2:41:59] rasx3: that was hype
[2:42:02] imjarrd: I really like Twila but he hasn't performed this split. Xiaopeng is a legit jungler though. One of the best in LPL

[2:52:56] YSZN: clid was a big loss for jdg, but levi/flawless were good investments, levi higher ceiling, meanwhile flawless shines at times but can communicate
[2:52:58] ltsviktor: faker is living off his legacy name, 100% BDD could make that SKT team look better

[2:54:13] zandelcorrin: @Saesong_ Agreed, he had 1 bad game and now he's 'All washed up' great logic there lol
[2:54:13] ckadian: Tarzan enables grf so much, if he wasn’t there grf wouldn’t be that good

[2:58:37] 1kenn1: lck 0 international title last year
[2:58:42] imjarrd: Right and my friends that tail me for more than your net worth... they're up a new car
[2:58:51] 1kenn1: why would Damwon hire IG coach after worlds?
[2:58:52] ckadian: Agreed but griffin and improved skt in world would be scary for anyone involved in worlds
[2:58:57] YSZN: who chose these highlights
[2:59:09] imjarrd: Just because I don't bet big doesn't mean I don't bet right. The ones that don't understand will just watch from the sidelines and that's fine
[2:59:13] Clairfoyance: @1kenn1 no wonder they got easy 0-3d in finals Kappa
[2:59:14] kekwitch: just watch again UCAL's play in worlds and you'll know that even c9 can destroy kt by mid difference
[2:59:17] CCIeaner: @1kenn1 because he won worlds LUL
[2:59:20] silenlg: EDG NotATK
[2:59:25] ckadian: Their match yesterday was clearly the best match of 2019 by far
[2:59:26] liangzhu: not just bad world's. they had a bad 2018
[2:59:32] 손이커: Kreygasm
[2:59:32] Rixoki: kramer is so good
[2:59:34] imjarrd: Because I am in college and believe that changing a unit is bad luck?
[2:59:41] 1kenn1: LCK trash af in 2018
[2:59:43] tosete: ??? just pressed R
[2:59:52] i48763: SN LUL
[2:59:53] kekwitch: @prince0fpain whole bad year and lucky worlds in 17
[2:59:56] liangzhu: they lost everything. MSI, all-stars rift rivals, Asian games, worlds
[2:59:58] Clairfoyance: 1 hr WutFace
[3:00:06] laserrainx: rip
[3:00:07] aaazbai: five five open
[3:00:08] ckadian: Just think though, griffin and improved skt in world would be scary for anyone involved in worlds
[3:00:08] 1kenn1: that LCK roster for asian games LUL
[3:00:08] kekwitch: LCK ONLY WON 17 WORLDS BY LUCK
[3:00:12] i48763: 1hours ResidentSleeper
[3:00:25] mystogeto: hmmm is any of these two worth watching ?
[3:00:28] Rixoki: lets be real, asian games dont count lol
[3:00:40] CCIeaner: time to switch to LCK LUL
[3:00:41] 1kenn1: it does count because theres a gold medal on the line
[3:00:55] imjarrd: @fialpiety2 You think you're the first to tell me this?
[3:00:59] Rixoki: lck had a bad year and yet 3 koreans still won the worlds title LUL
[3:01:09] imjarrd: The ones that call me a fraud are the ones that block me when I make money and laugh in their faces
[3:01:20] imjarrd: you can be next if you choose
[3:01:27] ckadian: I think lpl and lck are at par right now, but it’s clear that they are miles above eu and garbage na
[3:01:30] CCIeaner: time to go to bed and watch JAG LUL
[3:01:33] kekwitch: @rixoki ignoring that rookie claimed himself as chinese LUL
[3:01:43] 1kenn1: LPL has better coaching lately
[3:01:48] Rixoki: unironically thinking rookie is chinese LUL
[3:02:00] CCIeaner: Rookie the famous CHINESE midlaner LUL
[3:02:00] liangzhu: kt, skt, afreeca, kz geng. these teams all got beat internationally. it's the main reason I'm sceptical on Griffin.
[3:02:16] kekwitch: @rixoki he is, as he claimed so
[3:02:18] imjarrd: @Prince0fPain It's all good my man, I'm not here to talk to 12 year olds about my hobbies, just here for the league
[3:02:28] Rixoki: thats not how it works @93reddan
[3:02:28] 1kenn1: Griffin only good player is tarzan
[3:02:39] 1kenn1: and chovy sometimes depends on patch
[3:02:46] ckadian: Being skeptical is good, but then who do you think is clearly better team than skt and griffin ?
[3:02:46] CCIeaner: I claim myself as chinese too, when do i get citizenship ? :)
[3:03:11] kekwitch: @1kenn1 tarzan only look good because LCK JUNGLES SUCK...ecxept clid from lpl
[3:03:17] liangzhu: pretty sure lck is no competition for Griffin
[3:03:19] imjarrd: How am I wasting money if I'm making money? Everything is documented. Weird. You can choose not to make money with us, no one is forcing you to do anything
[3:03:25] CCIeaner: Clid from lpl ? LUL
[3:03:30] 1kenn1: lck has better jungler than lpl
[3:03:34] rebeccamo: pepeJAM
[3:03:43] 1kenn1: cliid is average as fk
[3:03:45] Rixoki: @1kenn1 wrong
[3:03:47] CCIeaner: @Shinryui They almost lost 2-0 to SKT yesterday LUL
[3:03:59] 1kenn1: just ban lee and he is just another j4 player
[3:04:03] imjarrd: I've been betting League since last year, hit my IG win worlds bet (obviously), and my friends who tailed me at school without a clue about League told me to make a Twitter and post my picks.
[3:04:08] basedsimp: wtf are the chinese doing for 1 hour
[3:04:10] liangzhu: yh that only adds to my scepticism
[3:04:19] basedsimp: just start the next match lol
[3:04:35] liangzhu: they gonna go to msi and get rekt by the lol team probably
[3:04:36] CCIeaner: a pause to go outside LUL
[3:04:38] 1kenn1: league betting is easy as sht
[3:04:44] LaoWai42: @basedsimp match one was in JDG's home arena in beijing
[3:04:51] kekwitch: tarzan even unable to pick lee
[3:04:51] Rixoki: lck starts soon
[3:05:01] LaoWai42: set two and three are from the main venue in shanghai
[3:05:05] Twenh: is doch jut
[3:05:20] 1kenn1: tarzan champ pool > cliid
[3:05:23] Bence0206: what do you guys bet on RW v5 and BLG vs SN ?
[3:05:40] Antonswayz: those skt griff games were insane last night ,
[3:05:48] liangzhu: v5 and blg win probably
[3:05:51] ckadian: No man but even if griffin and the new skt is unproven internationally, I don’t think anyone can say that any other team is clearly better than these two teams.. it’ll be a tough series for all other teams against them
[3:06:25] liangzhu: but I can literally say that the lol teams are better cos the competition' is higher
[3:06:26] imjarrd: @fialpiety2 Quiet all of a sudden.... Just like the others
[3:06:33] 1kenn1: I think ig will beat grf
[3:06:34] Antonswayz: griffin is on another level that teams can't keep up with
[3:07:05] ckadian: But how ? The skt grf series, everyone said that that has been the best best of three this year
[3:07:07] TrickedHat: RW or V5?
[3:07:10] liangzhu: yh lck teams can't keep up with griffin. but lck hasn't won anything all last year.
[3:07:19] ckadian: So how is any other team better?
[3:07:24] Antonswayz: that eve ult over the wall last night to pass the control ward, NA would've never thought of that
[3:07:33] 1kenn1: but its only march
[3:07:38] imjarrd: We're going to compare last year to this year?
[3:07:50] TrickedHat: who gonna win next
[3:07:54] ckadian: I’m only comparing the teams based on the data till March
[3:08:07] liangzhu: why assume that griffin is randomly better than ig. because they can beat lck teams. when lck teams can't make it past quarters?
[3:08:09] imjarrd: What does your life consist of? Trolling others on Twitch? Kappa
[3:08:22] ckadian: So what we have seen so far, how can anyone say that any other team is clearly better than skt grf?
[3:08:39] TrickedHat: anyone know rw vs v5
[3:09:04] ckadian: But I’m not saying better, I’m saying that no other team is clearly better. They may be equal but not better and definitely not clearly better
[3:09:05] rebeccamo: @ckadian if you think skt is a top tier team
[3:09:12] Antonswayz: u can tell who's better teams right now just by watching them, they don't have to play each other to see who's better or not
[3:09:34] Antonswayz: griffin will smash anyone in NA this year and they haven't played each other yet
[3:09:47] LaoWai42: @ckadian its almost like international tournaments are the only chance we get to see international teams play each other
[3:09:58] LaoWai42: imagine that
[3:10:00] ckadian: Haha you guys are trolling or didn’t see the series yesterday if you still think that.. well good for skt.. keep sleeping on them
[3:10:04] 1kenn1: faker playing tanks prob tilts his teammates every time LUL
[3:10:05] LaoWai42: Kappa
[3:10:09] imjarrd: Abmesley?
[3:10:31] ckadian: Well im all for sarcasm but I don’t like dismissing teams just like that..
[3:10:33] liangzhu: I can tell cos the skt Vs grf set was a fiesta. there was 3 baron fumbles in 3 games one that lost skt the set. faker random tp into death. and griffin losing a teamfight 6k gold up.
[3:10:44] Bence0206: @TrickedHat1139 V5 are the favourite by a bit
[3:10:47] 1kenn1: skt idk
[3:10:59] ckadian: Well mate, good for you
[3:11:03] rebeccamo: @ckadian i see how faker died three times the same way yesterday
[3:11:20] TrickedHat: @Bence0206 RW has a good history tho
[3:11:30] ckadian: But did you also see that he had vision around him and Tarzan avoided all to kill him
[3:11:32] Khaleeffy: VForVictory
[3:11:39] mihlu_lol: Tbh blg vs sn and dwg vs hle is the only good matches today
[3:11:51] ckadian: There is no counter play to that
[3:11:55] liangzhu: old faker would have flashed those es on sight
[3:11:59] Bence0206: so? this season they are 5-15 gamescore , v5 is 8-11 atleast
[3:12:09] rebeccamo: @ckadian and should he be careful after be killed twice
[3:12:24] Bence0206: @Mihlutheweaboo DWG vs KZ, HLE plays Jinair now
[3:12:34] TrickedHat: v5 doesnt have a history at all
[3:12:43] liangzhu: also really bad macro. sending faker to split Vs irelia instead of the riven
[3:12:45] ckadian: Man, just wait for vod reviews before passing judgment.. that’s all I’ll say
[3:13:00] Bence0206: not sure what you want to say with that @TrickedHat1139 , i dont see RW winning more than one map
[3:13:13] liangzhu: why? I can see with my own eyes
[3:13:13] 1kenn1: why do lck midlaner play lulu mid LUL
[3:13:24] kekwitch: pros should evade elise, thats elementary...faker unable to do that and LCK praising him as top midlaner lul
[3:13:43] TrickedHat: @Bence0206 V5 have lost the last 6 in a row
[3:13:45] imjarrd: I don't see any hope for RW they're pretty abismal
[3:13:58] ckadian: Well ok, I can clearly see when I’m being trolled.. peace out guys. Enjoy the rest of the matches
[3:14:15] chrisrox22: 46 min WutFace
[3:14:15] imjarrd: The question to ask yourself: Does RW have Jinoo? No. Does V5 have Jinoo? yes
[3:14:20] TrickedHat: @Bence0206 yeah nah dw just scrolled down RW no hope
[3:14:27] liangzhu: the troller left. nice
[3:14:52] kekwitch: troller unignorent himself as a true troller LUL
[3:15:18] kekwitch: *ignorent - my bad
[3:16:11] TrickedHat: V5 win atleast first round yea
[3:17:06] liangzhu: im more excited for rift rivals than msi tbh
[3:17:33] liangzhu: the result should be a clearer indication of region strength than msi
[3:17:57] kekwitch: why excited? 1st league teams wasting time facing 4th league team
[3:18:56] kekwitch: lec vs lcs will be 100% more worth to watch
[3:19:06] liangzhu: its top 4 vs top 4, so you get better match ups, shame it isnt bo5s, or it would be worlds but without the bad teams. xd
[3:19:59] kekwitch: but it does not make game when a league have only bad teams
[3:20:11] liangzhu: Right now, it would be, fpx, ig, top, rng vs grf, skt, sandbox, damwon, doesnt that sound better than msi to you? dunno guess its just me
[3:21:40] kekwitch: ok... i don want to say bad words to you only saying that 4v4 is not fun as former will destroy the latter... science
[3:22:11] on_my_face: LUL cant type chinese in lpl channel
[3:22:25] kekwitch: well maybe excited to see grf fans mourning and facing harsh truth LUL
[3:22:28] on_my_face: nic work twitch
[3:23:26] liangzhu: grffin could legit be the best team in the world, i just highly doubt it, considering the region they are playing in
[3:23:54] on_my_face: lck?
[3:24:41] liangzhu: yup, lck a region that got 3-0 by na last worlds, a region that lost allstar, rift rivals, msi, asia games, and didnt make it past quarters in worlds, yup that lck
[3:25:08] imjunsul: nice brain LOL
[3:25:20] imjunsul: the region with how many championships? they have 1 bad year and all of a sudden they are shit LOL
[3:25:34] on_my_face: they will catch up,no worries, korean know how to play game
[3:25:41] imjunsul: EU and LCK are the only ones that produce super stars dude.. other regions are getting carried by Koreans.. open your eyes and maybe you're brain might start working
[3:25:55] imjunsul: top 3 teams are probably LCK right now if anything...
[3:25:58] liangzhu: ^imagine unironically thinking this
[3:26:15] imjunsul: jesus this is why i can't watch LPL.. fans are narrow minded and so biased good night
[3:26:41] rebeccamo: @Shinryui you're right, just like fw undefeated in LMS
[3:26:49] on_my_face: lol u dumb too,i believe he is no lpl fan
[3:26:50] liangzhu: im not saying lpl has always been the best, lck has been for every year up until 2018, where afterward they havent proven that they are the best
[3:27:14] HystericsCasts: This is a great time to talk lads
[3:27:31] liangzhu: i literally watch both because i want to watch the best teams, from the most competitive regions
[3:27:36] on_my_face: ppl talking lck is trash or the best LUL
[3:27:50] ricardo_m_wu: any guys here？
[3:28:20] monkey42069: BigBrother
[3:28:22] on_my_face: IS THAT SHANGHAI DG? LUL

[3:29:05] on_my_face: 42-1 FEELSGOODMAN
[3:29:59] Dedication_Gaming: is froskurin casting?
[3:30:35] liangzhu: if you watch these matches between lpl and lck, in 2018, the lpl teams have better laning, bigger champ pool, better late game teamfighting and have up to par macro aswell. its not like 2018 was some random meta shift where lck teams got nerfed.
[3:31:41] wuuren: @Dedication_Gaming she's apart of EU cast team now
[3:32:58] liangzhu: on a side note, has anyone played new kayle? i cant seem to win on that champ lmao, i feel like a caster minion.
[3:34:13] Fenry: oh i love that song what is this songs name ?

[6:11:13] SonOfTangra: PogChamp

[6:17:17] 21044275: There's no proof at all
[6:17:29] adroit5927: if you look at mlxg he doesnt look well
[6:17:38] FriedBaozi: well I believe mlxg is signed until like 2021, so he's not going anywhere
[6:17:42] Namigod: i think lpl teams trying to satisfy everything the pros demand is possible, and junk food is one of them
[6:17:45] adroit5927: he looks like he's sick
[6:17:50] 1kenn1: mlxg need to eat
[6:17:57] imjarrd: LOL why would they lie? He didn't want to play this split, and spring is far less important than summer
[6:18:23] celailinda: he threw up when he was streaming
[6:18:24] 21044275: @JDub_LoL If a sportsmen on contract refuses to play, it's a breach of contract, that's the problem
[6:18:38] bourbonlol: I love how you guys even talk about health of the players just by watching
[6:18:41] Namigod: oh no
[6:19:11] FriedBaozi: well pretty sure RNG allowed him to take a break, just like how they let uzi rest every split
[6:19:21] bourbonlol: You guys should stick to league even though you are prob not that good at it
[6:19:31] hardenfull: this casting ResidentSleeper
[6:19:35] adroit5927: this game is ResidentSleeper neither of these teams are good
[6:19:51] LevelOneMudkip: Why the fuck would they not let MLXG take a break when they have Karsa lol
[6:20:01] 21044275: @FriedBaozi That is also a problem, a professional club cannot just allow their players to breach contracts with no punishment
[6:20:02] LevelOneMudkip: There is no reason to lie about it
[6:20:45] svens_ex_boyfriend: No chat?
[6:20:46] FriedBaozi: there's contract and there's being human, the club would also think in the long term so MLXG doesn't die on the stage
[6:20:51] LevelOneMudkip: But its not necessarily a breach of contract if they give him permission...? Do you know their contract?
[6:21:18] hd1040s: LPL= ResidentSleeper
[6:21:21] 21044275: I've never really seen a player deciding not to play and the club lets them do w/e they want in another sport, but ok
[6:21:27] FriedBaozi: like not actually "die" but if an athelete is injured, why would you play him when your sub is as good, if not better
[6:21:39] adroit5927: this is lck game lol 2 kills in 18 minutes
[6:21:39] svens_ex_boyfriend: LCK ResidentSleeper
[6:21:50] 1kenn1: good comp by blg
[6:21:51] imjarrd: Are you actually arguing that MLXG is breaching contract? Like what
[6:22:10] Namigod: you can't force someone to work when he's too sick to play, it's against the law lol
[6:22:11] 1kenn1: some of these players need break
[6:22:19] LevelOneMudkip: Do you know what MLXG’s contract says
[6:22:28] FriedBaozi: Plus even if MLXG breaks the contract, what's RNG gonna do? Kick one of the best jungler in the world?
