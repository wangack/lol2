[2:18:40] mic_oh: no Levi no win
[2:18:41] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: top LPL teams are on a complete different level than the LCK teams. For example grf would be considered middle tier in LPL.
[2:18:45] Oblivious565: go ahead and get used to the worlds way of playing
[2:18:49] Zencent: @Oblivious565 hard agree
[2:18:55] ignaciopicado94: gg
[2:18:57] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Its hard to say whos the best mid right now, im leaning towards bjergsen due to flexibility and carry potential. this time he has all the tools, BB is the new theshy and smoothie is the perfect support. This is why TSM will take the trophy this year and celebrate
[2:18:58] GorieI: Hey chat, take it easy please. Sometimes I see the same message posted twice. Take your time to actually read chat to avoid embarrassing incidents like this. Thank you. :)
