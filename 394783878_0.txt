[0:57:55] LeRandomHero: ZVEN LUL
[0:58:04] J2easoN: you could kick half of lpl and nobody would care
[0:58:17] ragebro13: Two teams that have shown signs of light, particularly in their top laners, but both teams have a very poor macro sense. With that being said, I am giving the edge to the team with the better jungler. SofM has been the bright spot of this pretty bad team, but with SofM and Flandre on comfort picks + V5 drafting rather poorly
[0:58:18] HystericsCasts: Well we are going to kick half of them after Week 10 so
[0:58:20] 棲久柿: UZI is not that carry now
[0:58:28] J2easoN: xD
[0:58:28] 1kenn1: If riot didnt intentionally ruin OGN SKT is a midtable team like in 2014
[0:58:30] laserrainx: probably a stomp. rw got perfect gamed by v5 a few days back

[1:00:11] chrisrox22: IMP OMEGALUL
[1:00:14] yudai95: @HystericsCasts if lpl had less teams, would the league be mroe competitive? because only the best players get in the teams, and teams have better rosters no?
[1:00:17] chx130423: I wonder why LEC and LCS all play BO1
[1:00:19] isf0xy: hehe
[1:00:25] smoke_lucky_strikes: With only a hand few of Kr players
[1:00:56] HystericsCasts: @yudai95 if you shrink the talent pool then spots would definitely be more competitive yes, but it also means development of the league slows down because new talent get zero chance to develop in the harsh climate known as LPL
[1:00:57] YuYuYuna: SourPls
[1:01:03] Hamatayoshi: anyone know what this songs called?
[1:01:04] tazeyb: I think there are enough league players in China to fill more than like 6 teams with good talent, I don't understand the criticism tbh

[1:01:10] GummiGrim: @chx130423 They did play Bo3 and Bo2 before, but I think it affected viewership too much

[1:02:45] GummiGrim: !papa
[1:02:51] AptApeArt: it also doesn't necessarily make the league itself more competitive although the spots in it may be. Could be that the teams remaining play at a higher level, could be that the skill differential between teams gets larger and the games appear less competitive
[1:03:00] 1_madmax_2: @rager4pe lets win some money bro
[1:03:12] restocatt: wait hold up. you telling me that I was rooting for WE, fell asleep halfway through the second game, and they came back and WON?

[1:03:50] ragebro13: I can see Snake stealing not only one game, but the entire series. Jinoo started strong but has failed to find comfort on a champion that gives his team the ability to play around him.
[1:03:52] Slash___: @M_TOX_ thanks KappaPride
[1:03:53] yudai95: whod id TOP lose to?
[1:03:58] ragebro13: On the other hand, I think SofM and Flandre will take care of Jinoo rather easily. Although this may look like two pretty bad teams squaring up, the games within the game will be fun to watch.

[3:24:07] EsportsTj: @xii_547 Farming simulator has an esports league now
[3:24:12] HystericsCasts: Due to some teams having their own stadium, games start dead on schedule, so we delay and cast them in English
[3:24:12] Frizzy0: @kennzy98 which odds did u take
[3:24:30] xii_547: what do u mean now, league has been there forever LUL

[3:33:34] d3rpinho: when will vlad start to be a problem?
[3:33:36] EgonThyPickle: @bigrig107 Might be because there's 16 teams and if every team has to play an average of 2 series per week that's over 2 series per day. To avoid the potential 9 game days it makes sense to schedule them at the same time at different locations
