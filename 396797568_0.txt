[8:25:37] CertainlySomeoneHere: I mean if you're far ahead, and if you're in low elo like me, then you can afford a rightious glory . But if not, then it probably isn't too efficient LUL
[8:25:45] Scores__: also rabadons dcap as 4th item is mega gold efficient
[8:26:14] Scores__: he clearly built it because its his signature item not because he thinks its the best item
[8:26:40] siegfriedOG: @CertainlySomeoneHere i play nautilus top lane on glory and shurelya x) on master
[8:26:58] siegfriedOG: simply for the lulz
[8:27:17] 83RNYY: @Scores__ well, im not saying you should go RG every game or even at all. Its just that i was very good this game obviously. He had morello and rod for some ap. Felt like he didn't need more dmg cuz he also had a team he could rely on. The ms is not only for him. Many ways it could be good but you know, probably wont work very well in soloq
