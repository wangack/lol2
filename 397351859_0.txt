[3:19:34] supracyka: i mean its understable why they suck at macro, but i cant get it why asians sucks at mechanics
[3:19:35] GummiGrim: @Bunnything Also if the patch is a play off patch, it will be disabled throughout the whole thing, and I believe 9.5 is the pro patch
[3:19:37] longhiep98: @imsokka yup
[3:19:43] Bunnything: @imsokka yes but I don't think LJL has an official translated stream

Just based on the Bo1 performances from TSM i admit TSM has a good shot at this MSI. Bjergsen is still one of the best midlaners in the world and best in the west.
