They have played different comps, with different win condition, obviously with varying degree of success, but the fact that we have seen they can play it is a great sign. They have played Split push comps, poke comps, and now team-fighting comp! I love that the best part about these, is they play them aggressively!

[1:44:58] Stargazer888: Last Worlds, we had Vitality and C9 playing extreme aggressive compositions and playstyle that caught other team off guards. The meta shifted, and C9 and Vitality got into it first. If TSM can play as aggressive as they do now, and play with an underdog mentality with nothing to lose, they might be able to surprise people and win MSI, Worlds.

[2:01:04] basement9411: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[2:14:20] go_la_ken: Statistically and stylistically, C9 beat Griffin in every way conceivable. C9 thrashed GENG and AFS which beat GRF. Nisqy is extremely dominant while Chovy is not much of a playmaking win condition for Griffin, more of just an Akali abuser when she was overpowered. Sneaky will match Viper and Licorice is the best North American talent of all time. Too easy for C9.

[3:10:34] yudai95: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.
