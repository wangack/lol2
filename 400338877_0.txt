[5:19:18] spicyvt: anyones parents divorced? :)
[5:19:19] yudai95: @Venon0706 last year TSM was the same thing, they started spring split like shit, than second half of split went in a 9-1 record, and ended the split third

[5:20:47] naulin1: @supervinlin_rulefive so can basically any actually good team
[5:20:50] yudai95: Right now MSI and worlds are the smaller picture for TSM, the real challenge is winning LCS, where they will face the highest level of competition. C9, TL, Fly Quest, 100T just to name a few, have some of the best macro and team fighting in the world. Will TSM win LCS? I don't know, do they deserve to win it? i think so, only time will tell.

[5:22:53] Venon0706: @yudai95 but last year the spring standings were way closer, this time not
[5:22:54] naulin1: @venon0706 because good shape isnt good enough. to win play offs let alone MSI. they need to be looking amazing. with the level of competition

[5:24:37] yudai95: @Venon0706 + what makes me laugh is people already saying they are strogner than last year TSM, like what are you basing that on? they have the same record as last eyar TSM in spring split, the exact same thing, they ended third in the split like last year TSM,
[5:24:41] Wolf52cz: LUL
[5:24:43] naulin1: @venon0706 when people hype TSM though. they generally overhype them. like do I think they got a solid shot at 2nd this split yea. maybe even first
[5:24:51] NoTearCN: Riot should add wooden division LUL
[5:25:12] yudai95: @Venon0706 current TSM is 7-1 in second half of split, last eyar tsml went 9-1 in second of spring split

[5:30:15] RozeXarocas: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.
