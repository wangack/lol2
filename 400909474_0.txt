[1:25:03] MaggoGx: sorcery instead of domination DansGame
[1:25:07] michaelsund: that aura is returning. If you've watched League of Legends longer than 2018, you know that aura. The TSM aura. The feeling that no matter how poorly the early game goes or how daunting the opponent, TSM, with one opening, can turn a certain loss to a beautiful, come-from-behind victory.

[1:25:40] Merou: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[2:33:11] Gunerdrag: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[2:33:24] KappaThe3rd: as the prophecy is told, one team will rise above the rest and claim their right as the best team in NA. One team is destined to take down the Asians for once and for all, and who you may ask, is the leader of this team? The captain? Well my friend, it’s none other than the greatest western player of all time; Bjergsen.
[2:33:25] michaelsund: that aura is returning. If you've watched League of Legends longer than 2018, you know that aura. The TSM aura. The feeling that no matter how poorly the early game goes or how daunting the opponent, TSM, with one opening, can turn a certain loss to a beautiful, come-from-behind victory.

[4:08:21] Worldie: @musN you can't build hurricane until level 11 since she's classified as melee
[4:08:23] Clairfoyance: @Zencent then every1 would just afk farm, game would be boring LUL
[4:08:27] ShionSinX: I dont like hurricane on Kayle at all, she already has AoE on her AA
[4:08:33] oengenheirocamarada: did EDG win?

[4:09:10] HystericsCasts: Letme is inactive
[4:09:18] Worldie: @Rudiko Q is too slow and costs too much mana to sustain it, E max also makes passive hit harder so it's standard
[4:09:25] Tayel: Why Clepto in Kayle?
[4:09:26] Clairfoyance: @Zencent nothing rly happens in lanes anymore, solo kills r rare LUL
