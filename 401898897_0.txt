They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[2:51:06] axletron: @Emeergee And the only team that took games off IG was KT, who played them in Quarters.
[2:51:06] Suitwo: what does he have think he is doinb Kappa
[2:51:08] vegeta1071: 원딜이 그정도고 미드,탑은 거의 점령한 수준이지

[2:51:18] zaqplm0123: 로컨 아테나 나가고 에버 망함
[2:51:20] axletron: Ye
[2:51:21] Quakkulol: yes
[2:51:23] rair1030: 크트가 로컨 데려오려다 꼬여서 그리 된거 아닌가
[2:51:25] 워누비: 탑미드도 다 점령하고있네
[2:51:27] 戳戳吉米: VAX

[2:51:57] rair1030: 정글은 중국이 잘하는거 인정
[2:51:59] RichardBlow: LCK is in a strange way. Their fastest teams win in KR, but their fastest teams are just watered down LPL.
[2:52:06] yudai95: monkaS
[2:52:10] ljh5506: 중국 정글 요즘 누가 잘함??
[2:52:13] rair1030: 그래도 타잔이면 괜찮을거임

[2:52:27] rair1030: 닝 카사
[2:52:28] 워누비: 닝
[2:52:29] RichardBlow: So they send their most vulnerable teams to MSI & Worlds. Altho SKT is looking real good this year so LPL might be hosed this year 4Head
[2:52:29] axletron: @zoh1 AFS Qualified for Worlds based on Spring Form. GRF couldn't make it because they weren't in LCK in Spring

[2:53:12] 네머리속의마구니: 플로리신 강등 정글이 중국 대표 정글중 하나라니
[2:53:12] zaqplm0123: 근데 카사 밀쳐내고 뛰던게 무진인데

[2:53:37] ljh5506: 카사 말곤 크게 확 와닫는 정글 없던거 같던데 닝도 카밀너프먹고 예전같진 않아서
[2:53:38] rair1030: 카사는 워낙에 머리가 좋은애라

[2:53:49] 워누비: 뭔 카사를 밀쳐내 카사 RNG가서 주전하고있던거지
[2:53:53] 호켄바크에서한판붙자: 닝도 작년보단 별로던데

[2:54:13] 네머리속의마구니: 중국 순혈중에 정글도 뭐 없네

[2:54:18] LaoWai42: np
[2:54:30] uzaspytongas: korea plays all around vision
[2:54:35] biohacker__: if uzi is not playing im leaving lul
[2:54:37] rair1030: 다음 경기도 재밌겠네
[2:54:37] zooohh: @axletron and that's how it works, it's the same for every regions
[2:54:40] biohacker__: isnt he gonna play?
[2:54:41] Emeergee: @dalderbash yeah i agree but could that be lcks downfall being too safe is what i always thought last year too
[2:54:45] RichardBlow: @Emeergee What ends up making it odd is that the CN-lite teams like KZ and KT run a train locally in KR, but their macro also isn't as good (for KR, anyways) so they're easier to beat than SS & SKT. SS & SKT if you forget one thing you're done.
[2:54:46] zaqplm0123: 무진 한화요
[2:54:56] rair1030: 알엔지에 오엠지면 팬 개많은 팀들 간 대결 아닌가
[2:54:57] 워누비: 중국 순혈중에 그나마 띵구 샤오후 미드
[2:55:03] uzaspytongas: uzi is inting last times so
[2:55:04] coltluger: @coffee_drink the starting roster is zz1tai, karsa, xiaohu, uzi, ming
[2:55:07] ljh5506: 중국 정글이 잘해보였던게 롤드컵때 우리나라 대표로 나갔던 정글이 스피릿... 엠비션... 후
[2:55:15] 워누비: 탑은 진짜 답도없음 한국인 제외하면
[2:55:15] biohacker__: YAY UZI
[2:55:17] Kornedd: @Vibenos was*
[2:55:20] svens_ex_boyfriend: @axletron I think every tournament in a year is pretty constant to me
[2:55:20] moribund_boi: gogo omg
[2:55:21] biohacker__: im staying
[2:55:26] biohacker__: @coltluger ty
[2:55:28] RichardBlow: @Emeergee Yeah, KZ and KT are crazy fast for LPL, but for CN that playstyle is Tuesday. Kappa
[2:55:29] rair1030: 엠비션이 피지컬이 딸려서 그렇지 동선이 나쁘진 않았어..
[2:55:36] 네머리속의마구니: 서포터도 전부 마타 아래 있는 놈들이고
[2:55:36] axletron: @zoh1 Yeah, and that system is wrong. Just because 'that's how it works' doesn't mean it's right.
[2:55:39] 워누비: 동선은 좋앗지
[2:55:42] RichardBlow: @Emeergee Err... LCK >.>
[2:55:47] uzaspytongas: @kornedd ye mb
[2:55:47] Quakkulol: uzi od actually trying to carry this shittie RNG team
[2:55:49] anmabe6: RNG lost twice in a row
[2:55:52] Quakkulol: is*
[2:56:02] RichardBlow: Poor RNG. 2018 was their year, man!
[2:56:14] IgnotusReshi: !song
[2:56:19] biohacker__: did ig win yesterday/
[2:56:23] RichardBlow: Then they got dunked in Worlds. They won MSI tho so I guess they're just sharing the Chinese glory Kappa
[2:56:23] bobby98131: Uzi still playing RNG ?
[2:56:29] svens_ex_boyfriend: God these GRF fanboys are delusional
[2:56:30] rair1030: 마타 그런데 브라움은 영... 못하던데
[2:56:32] ljh5506: 동선은 좋았지 할수있는 정글챔이 한정적인게 문제지만
[2:56:32] Quakkulol: @coffee_drink they lost
[2:56:37] axletron: @svens_ex_boyfriend so what does 3 years before that for the same TEAM from LCK mean? Equally consistent?
[2:56:41] Somatic9: IG lost to BLG 2-1 LUL
[2:56:50] kiddersc: song is: Darude-Sandstorm
[2:56:50] zooohh: @axletron if you are a world worthy team you should run through the gauntlet or win the split, and dont count too much on having points
[2:56:51] biohacker__: BibleThump IG
[2:56:54] Emeergee: @dalderbash i think the meta will shift for teams like KZ RnG and GRF even more cos they way next patch is looking like we going back to tank meta
[2:57:00] 워누비: 근데 롤드컵우승시즌도 스크가 RNG 못이겻으면 RNG우승이엇을듯
[2:57:07] 네머리속의마구니: 다못하는거보단 브라움만 못하는게 낫지
[2:57:18] axletron: @zoh1 So that means IG aren't worthy right? Because they didn't win eithe.r
[2:57:19] Jahkee: 2-1omg. rng look bad recently
[2:57:20] rair1030: 누가 갈리오 밴안하래? 깔깔깔
[2:57:23] KnifeBed: i love tanks :)
[2:57:26] TheYodix: GRF is strong, but I think it would be like tied for 4th on LPL, not on top 3
[2:57:26] 워누비: 5연갈리오 ㅋㅋㅋ
[2:57:27] 히키: 지금 브라움이 1티어 서풋이니까 아쉽게 느끼는 거겠지
[2:57:33] 호켄바크에서한판붙자: 5연갈ㅋㅋㅋ
[2:57:44] Emeergee: @dalderbash i rate KZ pree high rn its just the wildcard pawn in mid if they had bdd still that team couldve been something imo
[2:57:50] rair1030: 전설의 5연갈..
[2:57:51] axletron: @TheYodix lol, you're funny
[2:57:53] 사비님: 5연갈은 위엄 있었지. 멱살 캐리 보여주고.
[2:57:55] RichardBlow: @Emeergee Man I hope so, 'cause I'm one of the five League players who actually likes tanks. Kappa
[2:58:05] coltluger: @Emeergee pawn is in really good form, though
[2:58:09] svens_ex_boyfriend: Salty western lck fanboys in lpl chat how surprising Kappa
[2:58:18] RichardBlow: @Emeergee They back on form in KR ATM, but, well... We all know about Chokezone 4Head
[2:58:23] kutoriiii: grf＞ig＞skt＞LPL＞lck , right TPFufun
[2:58:27] KnifeBed: SourPls
[2:58:33] zooohh: @axletron if I recall IG wasnt looked as a good contender at the begining of worlds, same for VIT
[2:58:36] Emeergee: @dalderbash oh no a tank fan i like watching tank meta because cleaner fights bbut playing its dogshit imo
[2:58:37] ljh5506: 중국도 오프닝 많이 발전했네 예전에 우지 키보드 샷건치는거 보다가 이거보니까 ㅋㅋㅋ
[2:58:41] biohacker__: what makes us feel that korea meta is whats holding them back is that almost every team in lpl has koreans.. so we can assert that their skill is not the problem, but the slow paced style
[2:58:51] rair1030: 우지 퉁퉁 점프하는거 아직도 기억난다
[2:58:56] joshua930719: BGM PLS
[2:58:58] gratisdobronze: NA LPL
[2:59:07] RichardBlow: @Emeergee Yeah no, Season 5 was the one time I said "... Maybe a little bit less tanks would be nice?"
[2:59:08] axletron: @svens_ex_boyfriend Who's a salty western LCK fan? My favourite players is Doinb...
[2:59:11] 100yearjanna: Let's go RNG.
[2:59:17] 호켄바크에서한판붙자: lpl은 각팀당 한번씩만 붙는건가
[2:59:18] zaqplm0123: 우지 사이온궁 오프닝이 ㄹㅇ 명작

[2:59:34] axletron: @zoh1 .... you're kidding right? They were 36/2 in regular season. Of course they were.
[2:59:36] TheYodix: @axletron Why am I funny? Are you at least watching the games? GRF doesn't look half as strong as chinese teams

[3:00:54] svens_ex_boyfriend: Who’s the caster on the right

[3:01:23] TheYodix: @axletron Yes, they can lose, but that is rooting for GRF, not just knowing they're better
[3:01:26] narvuntien: The top teams in the LPL keep randomly droping matches they shouldn't
[3:01:26] axletron: @zoh1 Maybe you jumped on the RNG bandwagon, but I thought IG were the strongest team at Worlds... and Jatt both thought they'd make it to the Finals.

[3:05:27] axletron: @zoh1 I understand where you're coming from, but I think the points system is outdated, as is Gauntlet, which benefits teams with more practice time. LCK suffered from that. Gen G and AFS didn't deserve to be there, regardless of how they made it through. Just like 100T didn't deserve to be there.

[4:46:45] ultimec1a: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.
