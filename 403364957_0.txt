[2:05:36] usedxsoul: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[2:07:37] Sov25: @21044275 A Clown Fiesta is a strange series of events in which nobody - not even the players! - knows what's going on, and occasionally, this term is applied to League of Legends games during ridiculous moments and sloppy play

[2:20:07] kingthingol: Best LPL teams are FPX, IG, TOP and RNG

[2:28:24] madiiiman: @1haman3 3rd place... like i said. kz are outmatched in every other role. and skts bot lane can draw even or better than deft and tusin. it wont hold up in a bo5
[2:28:30] Sov25: @Zathorius89 I think you're mistaken. I dont like TSM. I just watch there videos when they lose lol. 2018 was them trying to blame ssong per usual.

[2:29:35] madiiiman: @1haman3 in lane i think they can make the lane a push. late game? id rather have teddy to be completely honest. deft is still prone to tilt
[2:29:37] Sov25: @1haman3 Did you forget the last series? Deft was inting so hard that clid was even soloing him
[2:29:41] madiiiman: @ChappeyNineOne LUL ok thats actually moronic

[2:30:12] madiiiman: @ChappeyNineOne clid is arguably the best jungler in the LCK rn the only one you can say is as good or better is tarzan
[2:30:18] madiiiman: @ChappeyNineOne beats you with j4...
[2:30:24] madiiiman: @ChappeyNineOne or multiple other picks

[2:31:44] madiiiman: @1haman3 besides tarzan, who is as good as or better than clid in the lck?
[2:31:50] Sov25: @PLEASE_DONT_SPAM_KAPPA You think he's eating clams? Maybe with mayo inside LUL
[2:31:51] ChappeyNineOne: Faker not even better than Pawn, the kid is old.
[2:32:03] kekwitch: cuzz was as good as tarzan last game
[2:32:08] madiiiman: @1haman3 and i said i prefer teddy late game because deft is prone to tilt, which is 100% true
[2:32:21] Sov25: @ChappeyNineOne 22 years is consider old now? LUL good one
[2:32:29] madiiiman: teddy is beyond tilt proof. the dude 1v9d on jin air for a year

[2:34:05] Sov25: @madiiiman Yea I remember that as well.
[2:34:33] madiiiman: if you want to think tarzan is better than clid, i wont argue with that. i think you can say eithe rtarzan or clid is best jungle in lck

[2:42:08] madiiiman: @BoomShaqaLaqa i havent heard that name in so long LUL
[2:42:18] ChappeyNineOne: Ning > he has the mvp LUL
[2:42:21] BoomShaqaLaqa: distSmile @madiiiman
[2:42:25] Hoaw: Cruzerthebruzer is the best player in the world. Get over it, haters!
[2:42:26] kekwitch: Shy was in CJ frost how long he has been playing haha
[2:42:28] EsportsTj: This is Katana. Her sword traps the souls of it victims. I would advise not getting killed by her
[2:42:40] madiiiman: theshy has been around for fucking forever
[2:42:45] originmorii: i think people in here just have a hardon for acting like LCK players arent as good as LPL players, but its weird bc you can tell that none of them actually have watched any LCK bc they sound so dumb
[2:42:45] usedxsoul: I think theshy is the best player in the world, but the other 4 players on his team arent up to the level of him.
[2:42:52] madiiiman: zztai has been playing professionally since he was 13 i think
[2:43:00] YakHerd: TheShy makes teams play differently just like Faker does. I think a team soon is going to show that the team around TheShy can be taken advantage of just like they figured that about SKT over time.
[2:43:06] BoomShaqaLaqa: Atleeast OCE playoffs are on 4Head
[2:43:21] itmealic: @Glacier18 fanboys from every region are all delusional
[2:43:22] kekwitch: Well nobody in the world now is on level of THESHY....
[2:43:33] Hoaw: yikes so much cringe in the chat
[2:43:47] madiiiman: its gonna be at least another year before any top laner can maybe give theshy a run for his money
[2:43:47] usedxsoul: @YakHerd Sure, but SKT won 3 world titles and are a threat with a revamped roster this year. Will they win? Who knows. But they could.
[2:43:50] m1lonas123: TheThing > TheShy
[2:44:01] Hoaw: I have heard at least 10 different people argue about 10 different players being #1 in the world LUL
[2:44:10] LimboMoon: vn poggers
[2:44:26] usedxsoul: @1haman3 Any who doesnt say the shy are just memeing or actually Pepega
[2:44:32] madiiiman: @1haman3 any1 who says the best player in the world is anyone other than thesky or rookie right now is kidding themselves. and more than likely its thesky not rookie
[2:44:39] madiiiman: theshy*
[2:44:45] ChappeyNineOne: Ning
[2:44:50] ChappeyNineOne: LUL\
[2:44:51] nanosamadaisuki: @UsedxSoul real shit dude
[2:45:04] nanosamadaisuki: TheShy is actually just a fucking monster
[2:45:12] KungPaoPi: o wtf that was so crisp
[2:45:16] LimboMoon: damn
[2:45:18] madiiiman: theshy 1v9d a game when his team was all doing well
[2:45:22] Hoaw: @UsedxSoul @madiiiman what about imaqtpie? I feel like he can destroy TheShy and Rookie like a bunch of randoms
[2:45:35] madiiiman: @1haman3 LUL yeah i forgot about him my bad
[2:45:38] kekwitch: And theshy lost that game haha
[2:45:49] madiiiman: no
[2:45:50] usedxsoul: Look im the biggest SKT nuthugger and LCK nuthugger in the world, but if you dont think TheShy is the best in the world, you arent just a nuthugger, you are straight delusional
[2:45:57] madiiiman: it was his jayce game against g2, they won
[2:46:00] LimboMoon: tyler 1 better
[2:46:12] Hoaw: Anyway, back to NA, I feel really bad for them. Their best top laner, Licorice, lost to Bwipo in a matchup where Licorice hard wins. Is the region done for, or you think they can bounce back?
[2:46:23] ChappeyNineOne: I bet my virginity, Ray will destroy this TheShy bum
[2:46:28] kekwitch: oh not whole game, but that set
[2:46:29] Hoaw: Talking about Ekko vs Viktor by the way
[2:47:00] usedxsoul: Ekko vs viktor is such a stupid matchup
[2:47:07] madiiiman: @ᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢ even during the match papsmithy mentioned that its the first time hes seen some1 arguably 1v9 a game in which every1 on their team was still doing well, it was just that dominant
[2:47:14] kekwitch: shy was winning with vlad against ryze, but ryze bought morello and mad an upset
[2:47:15] KungPaoPi: if its worth anything theshy is half of these clips
[2:47:16] usedxsoul: C9 should just stop picking ekko and ban it themselves because they never do good with it LUL
[2:47:19] nanosamadaisuki: @ChappeyNineOne prepare to lose your virginity shipOWO
[2:47:29] PrimusRed: this game looks pretty dang sweet
[2:47:31] Zathorius89: god theshy
[2:47:37] kekwitch: @madiiiman we are not talking about same game, maybe
[2:47:47] Hoaw: @PrimusRed what game?
[2:47:49] madiiiman: @ᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢ game 3 against g2 at worlds
[2:47:57] PrimusRed: The v5
[2:47:58] madiiiman: @ᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢᆢ his jayce vs perkz irelia?
[2:48:01] usedxsoul: Jensen blew it with ekko, Licorice blew it with Ekko @1haman3
[2:48:10] ChappeyNineOne: Marin prime > theshy. prove me wrong LUL
[2:48:10] kekwitch: @madiiiman I was talking about ryze vs vlad game
[2:48:11] usedxsoul: C9 Ekko is not a thing
[2:48:15] madiiiman: ahh
[2:48:27] usedxsoul: Marin prime LUL
[2:48:28] kengonen1: Can NA make so many highlights in a season?
[2:48:30] Somatic9: Put the Ekko away, C9. Put it away and never take it out again
[2:48:37] Hoaw: @ChappeyNineOne If we are talking about primes, then Smeb is the best top laner we have ever seen. Smeb was literally the best player in the world
[2:48:40] nanosamadaisuki: C9 Ekko OMEGALUL Vitality Ekko shipWOW
[2:48:41] usedxsoul: Marin never had a prime.
[2:48:53] ChappeyNineOne: LUL Smeb 0 WCs
[2:48:59] usedxsoul: Marin was hype then downfall, never a prime in his career or lack thereof
[2:49:06] Hoaw: If we are talking about PRIMES, then Smeb > Marin > Khan > TheShy
[2:49:07] M4RW3N: where is marin now ?
[2:49:19] usedxsoul: I think in taiwan maybe?
[2:49:20] kekwitch: we could check even theshy cannot win the game with vlad if enemy buys morello...
[2:49:28] ChappeyNineOne: @UsedxSoul You get MVP in a Worlds Finals LUL
[2:49:46] nanosamadaisuki: @M4RW3N not doing anything with pro league this year
[2:49:51] tachibanall: PunOko
[2:50:01] kekwitch: Smeb... never won worlds...LUL
[2:50:20] 1kenn1: was Smeb good last year
[2:50:26] usedxsoul: Lots of people never won worlds lmao
[2:50:31] tachibanall: TSMed?
[2:50:39] Hoaw: What do the Chinese fans think of Uzi? The dude literally has a 50% chance of playing worse than sneaky and 50% chance of being unmatchable
[2:50:45] M4RW3N: Marin is the best man
[2:50:51] kekwitch: @1kenn1 you saw smeb being destroyed by theshy
[2:51:01] 1kenn1: I only watch game 5 of that series
[2:51:03] M4RW3N: sad his didn't get the credit he deserve
[2:51:08] Hoaw: Smeb is so bad right now, but nobody can deny that he was the best player in the world
[2:51:19] 1kenn1: made loads of money from tht game too
[2:51:22] Zigbean1: why did the game start at 8:55
[2:51:24] kekwitch: although every toplaners get destroyed by Theshy, Smeb was sooooooo bad
[2:51:37] arcussma23: ?
[2:51:38] Hostessie: IG vs EDG
[2:51:38] ChappeyNineOne: Smeb plays in a region that cant even get Semi's at worlds anymore.
[2:51:46] usedxsoul: I dont think Smeb even likes league anymore.
[2:51:48] tachibanall: I still remember that combo Kenneth vs G2 xdd
[2:51:59] tachibanall: Kenen
[2:52:08] Hoaw: @UsedxSoul i think most old players don't. They just do it for the money I guess
[2:52:13] usedxsoul: @ChappeyNineOne Who cant get semis at worlds?
[2:52:14] kekwitch: If you want to be a best laner, you MUST acquire worlds at least once...
[2:52:19] arcussma23: Kenneth PogChamp
[2:52:26] Hoaw: Nobody can convince me players like Smeb and Peanut still care about the game.
[2:52:31] 1kenn1: Uzi won MSI
[2:52:39] 1kenn1: hes the best adc still
[2:52:40] ChappeyNineOne: @UsedxSoul Korea, this isnt 2017
[2:52:54] nanosamadaisuki: Current day Peanut makes me so sad to watch shipHANDS
[2:53:10] usedxsoul: Wow a region didnt make semis one year and everyone is like ohhhh they cant make semis LUL
[2:53:11] kekwitch: @1kenn1 at least he has MSI, smeb has none of either
[2:53:30] 1kenn1: Smeb cant even win that ESL event
[2:53:45] 1kenn1: that ESL event TSM won LUL
[2:53:51] ChappeyNineOne: @UsedxSoul Korea trash, thats why you watch china kid
[2:54:05] nanosamadaisuki: Tfw the 3 teams Korea sent to worlds are the 3 teams fighting each other to avoid relegation alongside fucking jin air
[2:54:11] M4RW3N: they enjoy watching LCK and they
[2:54:16] M4RW3N: liars
[2:54:17] usedxsoul: @ChappeyNineOne I dont watch China, im just waiting for korea games to actually start :)
[2:54:30] kengonen1: LPL=NBA of basketball
[2:54:41] tachibanall: who will play today?
[2:54:49] usedxsoul: LCK = Canada of Hocket
[2:54:56] tachibanall: Im waiting for IG
[2:55:17] kekwitch: lck cannot get semi this year not because they did not get semi last year...its because they play not so good this year
[2:55:23] ChappeyNineOne: NA = football EU = football :O
[2:55:26] nanosamadaisuki: @tachibanall here? TOP vs BLG right now, then IG vs EDG. LCK? Gen.G vs Sandbox, then SKT vs Afreeca
[2:55:27] 1kenn1: LCK coaches are garbo
[2:55:28] Hoaw: I want KZ vs IG and GRF vs FPX, gonna be creamy
[2:55:33] 1kenn1: LPL coaches way better last worlds
[2:55:53] kengonen1: this game will decide blg get in the playoff or not
[2:56:01] usedxsoul: Actually a lot of the bracketing is based around which side you get placed in
[2:56:03] YakHerd: Where is BLG in the ranking again?
[2:56:10] kekwitch: @1kenn1 lck coaches lost banpicks against na LUL

[2:57:06] SkepticID: ben benched? LUL

[2:58:49] Boey420: i thought top is a better team
[2:58:50] ChappeyNineOne: @adroit5927 BLG paying them off LUL
[2:58:53] YakHerd: @adroit5927 probably testing others to fillout their roster with the assumption they will make msi
[2:58:55] usedxsoul: Doublelift is the best Domestic player in the world, He dominates NA so hard and makes them look so bad on every other teams bot lane, You wont find a more dominant player domestically. The real problem is doublelift sucks internationally and will never hoist a world title.
[2:58:59] chunkit1922: Marin LUL
[2:59:01] 1kenn1: C9 is all about business apparently
[2:59:20] nekomoemoe: TOP 10-4 BLG 8-6

[3:00:20] Hoaw: is reksai still op?
[3:00:45] ChappeyNineOne: @1kenn1 He just got back2back MVP tho. Damwon should keep both him and flame
[3:01:03] kekwitch: I saw a surprising data that told me that sneaky was 1st~2nd ad carry in 14 worlds (DPM data) if he was with better teammates or if he played for samsung teams, he could win the 14world lol
[3:01:09] YakHerd: i just like the story with metoer (meteor) and the name mistake
[3:01:34] Fortilux1: BLG is a very LCK style team ye?
[3:01:36] LaoWai42: metoer also a former ping pong pro
[3:01:45] adroit5927: BLG is probably gonna win this, anyways TOP wont make a strong MSI contender with their recent performances
