[0:11:55] CertainlySomeoneHere: I'm ready certai1Hype WHERE"S RAZ
[0:12:03] Nitesearcher: @edfu2k This is one of the few songs that is actually available publicly, it's called Feeling You by Ashley Warren/Bjorn Nilsson
[0:12:05] Clairfoyance: @CertainlySomeoneHere usually Kappa means joking, and im the biggest joke there is LUL
[0:12:19] will_o_will: XIYE WILL PLAY KASSDIN I AM CALLING IT I AM FROM FUTURE
[0:12:38] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Lofi_Chill I mean Kappa is also used to excuse toxity a lot of the time LUL but this is common knowledge

[0:15:07] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Lofi_Chill x) Kappa is used for sarcasm a lot of the times yes, but there's always people who go a step too far
[0:15:52] basement9411: are these teams any good?
[0:16:19] CertainlySomeoneHere: !casters

[0:16:44] CertainlySomeoneHere: @I_Love_You_Chat it's too early for chat to be active CorgiDerp
[0:17:55] Clairfoyance: @CertainlySomeoneHere it generally means tat wat was said isnt to be taken serious but yea
[0:18:19] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Lofi_Chill I know, and that's why people think they can say literally everything and that a kappa will excuse it LUL
[0:18:52] Clairfoyance: @CertainlySomeoneHere ah, gotcha LUL
[0:19:22] CertainlySomeoneHere: I wish they'd show the names of the songs on screen CorgiDerp
[0:19:34] lynstarfall: Kappa Clap
[0:19:47] VingerX: i dont think that would be great production value
[0:19:47] ehdwls4347: ÌîåÎ†àÏù¥Ïò§ÌîÑÏûÑ?
[0:19:55] CertainlySomeoneHere: @VingerX Why not?
[0:20:19] VingerX: because it would look very amateurish
[0:20:41] CertainlySomeoneHere: @VingerX Depends on the way it's shown?
[0:21:06] VingerX: they are trying to make this look like a serious esport
[0:21:10] inquisidordelapocalipsis: DansGame
[0:21:46] paladin_11: !patch
[0:21:46] Moobot: @paladin_11 This is patch 9.5 (hotfixxed) POGGERS
[0:22:05] CertainlySomeoneHere: Patch command is wrong, it's 9.6 for playoffs
[0:22:05] YSZN: is anyone currently watching bbq vs apk?
[0:22:28] VingerX: i was wondering about that... i thought it was 9.6 too

[0:22:46] Clairfoyance: @YSZN where is it on?
[0:22:54] jin_air_better_than_west: Faker will crush lpl at msi and worlds
[0:22:55] Nitesearcher: @CertainlySomeoneHere Yeah I wish too, I remember a mod a while back said that a lot of the songs are locked behind a licensed library, which is why they are hard to find
[0:23:18] YSZN: @Lofi_Chill afreeca
[0:23:28] idiotfella: is that the first game of the playoffs?
[0:23:33] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Nitesearcher Hm, I'm curious about how that works ü§î Guess I might ask Laowai about it later. Thanks for mentioning that

[0:25:47] VingerX: does WE have a chanc?
[0:26:12] Miitniick: believe in yagao my boi
[0:26:15] flamazide: JDG is the favorite
[0:26:19] Clairfoyance: @YSZN is it even live LUL
[0:26:22] flamazide: im sorry. WE is the favorite. typo
[0:26:24] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Nitesearcher Exactly! I was hoping for something like that to be done. It might just be the lack of staff to set up something like that though, but I have no clue. Let's see what they can do
[0:26:51] YSZN: ***
[0:26:54] basement9411: whos the best playee from thse 2 teams @supervinlin_rulefive
[0:27:03] basement9411: player

[0:27:12] amymol: JDGNB
[0:27:17] flamazide: Yagao can be the best if he plays Zoe
[0:27:24] basement9411: yes
[0:27:39] magikaki: S7 WE is back Poggers PogChamp
[0:27:45] flamazide: @High420 we only say best of 8 because they JUST played each other. it is BO5 today
[0:28:02] flamazide: dude xiye is playing out of his MIND lately
[0:28:05] basement9411: what position is zoom
[0:28:13] flamazide: Zoom is top lane
[0:28:25] rookiesmurf: Xiye will pop off again

[0:28:34] basement9411: kk will check this match lot

[0:30:26] Miitniick: here they comes the lck fan bois NotLikeThis ResidentSleeper
[0:30:37] flamazide: @piratesZ most post that watch the lpl watch on different platforms
[0:30:37] basement9411: ResidentSleeper
[0:30:42] VingerX: i hope teams quit picking jayce
[0:30:52] flamazide: why dont you liek jayce?
[0:30:59] PokeOne: BEST OF 8 PogChamp
[0:31:05] VingerX: i dont think he is good right now
[0:31:20] YSZN: next lck is going to be weird if we have no official telecom teams
[0:31:26] basement9411: @supervinlin_rulefive that's the there entertaining part of lpl
[0:31:38] goblinguy01: The LPL has better players
[0:31:40] VingerX: if TheShy cant win with jayce then jayce cant be good
[0:31:40] flamazide: really? in the LPL he does pretty well. i think he doesnt seem to have a lot of success in other regions because of how they play
[0:31:49] goblinguy01: Their skill shows off in Teamworks. LCK likes to ResidentSleeper farm
[0:31:55] flamazide: but...he wins with jayce a LOT
[0:32:05] basement9411: @vingerx have u seen khangas khans jayce
[0:32:10] VingerX: last game he starte like 1/4
[0:32:14] goblinguy01: TheShy lost lane once in the past few months lol
[0:32:19] rookiesmurf: theshy>>>khan
[0:32:20] goblinguy01: TheShy was camped and Inted
[0:32:20] PiratesZ: HAS TO WIN 8 GAMES IN A ROW TO ADVANCE OMEGALUL
[0:32:23] VingerX: with jayce
[0:32:24] lunarwolffff: He got camped hard
[0:32:28] PiratesZ: :)
[0:32:36] goblinguy01: TheShy gets camped on Poppy
[0:32:42] goblinguy01: OMEGALUL
[0:32:56] YSZN: @goblibguy01 I agree, but skt-grf games can be exciting since they're more proactive than the lck teams
[0:33:03] VingerX: i think the game is slowing down and goin later so lucian and jayce arent as good in past patches
[0:33:03] goblinguy01: If you don't give theShy the Dyrone treatment = GG
[0:33:21] goblinguy01: Griffin seems so tilted. They lost to Afreeca, KZ, and GenG. Skt broke them
[0:33:25] la7041831: È£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£ûÈ£û
[0:33:30] trisssmerigold: NA too slow to catch LPL's fast paced games, thinking its random fiesta, ends up getting absolutely destroyed by cn at worlds EVERY SINGLE TIME, ,, 2019 MSI here we go again NA LUL
[0:33:36] flamazide: even trying to gank TheShy is risky lol he may just kill 3 people by himself
[0:33:54] VingerX: lpl has been on old patches for awile now
[0:33:59] VingerX: they always get them late
[0:34:02] goblinguy01: Imagine IG playing against great NA top laners, BrokenBrain, Intzer, IntPact
[0:34:08] goblinguy01: OMEGALUL
[0:34:10] trisssmerigold: Every year NA thinks they've got this, this is the year for them to shine, they've been performing like absolute gods (in NA), they had GREAT results against Korean teams (in scrims),,, 2019 here we go agaan....
[0:34:14] sicairius: unlocked mercenary Pog
[0:34:23] flamazide: yeah patches have to get approved by the government so the lpl is usually a patch behind
[0:34:24] goblinguy01: Impact couldn't do anything against in 2018 worlds.
[0:34:35] YSZN: grf no longer seems like the unstoppable force where the msi win seemed inevitable, but their skill ceiling is still hard to rival
[0:34:44] VingerX: impact is trash imo
[0:34:46] xcpn: Not the government lul
[0:34:49] goblinguy01: Griffin won't beat RNG. Dont @ me
[0:34:53] basement9411: grf will lose to TSK
[0:34:55] sicairius: impact is trash in lane but good outside
[0:34:56] PiratesZ: LPL OMEGALUL LCK OMEGALUL
[0:34:59] basement9411: don't@ me
[0:35:01] xcpn: LPL is a patch behind because the schedule in China is too long
[0:35:01] PiratesZ: NALCS PogChamp
[0:35:01] sicairius: so meh overall
[0:35:07] basement9411: TSN
[0:35:12] greseg69: How big of a favourite is WE in this matchup considering it's a BO5?
[0:35:15] basement9411: TSL
[0:35:15] flamazide: griffin would get crushed by IG. i wouldnt be surprised if they couldnt FPX.
[0:35:19] PiratesZ: TSM WIN WORLDS S9 PogChamp
[0:35:28] basement9411: T ESS M
[0:35:28] goblinguy01: Impact will get trashed by theShy, Zztai, Sword, Khan, Wunder
[0:35:29] PiratesZ: Clap
[0:35:31] RafoelB: G2 will win everything, dont be salty
[0:35:36] YSZN: I have grf making worlds, but skt representing for msi
[0:35:44] sicairius: Im not a fan of any team in particular. I'm just a fan of whoever plays the best League of Legends and right now that just happens to be Vaevictis Esports.
[0:35:58] flamazide: @Plusswag WE crushed JDG a few days ago. most people expect them to win this.
[0:35:59] PiratesZ: ANY ROGUE FANS OMEGALUL
[0:36:00] sicairius: HotPokket
[0:36:01] basement9411: The Shy will get shat on by Broken Blade
[0:36:07] VingerX: griffin is really good after they have been on the patch for awile.. and i think viper was much better in an ap bot lane meta
[0:36:08] SilverDenTV: @dangerouspepe uff
[0:36:12] QIBuS: @dangerouspepe LUL
[0:36:15] Moobot: Please don't fill up the entire chat, @supervinlin_rulefive (warning)
[0:36:20] goblinguy01: BrokenBrain ints so often
[0:36:34] goblinguy01: He lost TSM game 1 in quarters game 1
[0:36:37] FK_P: WE vs JDG is about the same lvl as LCK finals, if not better
[0:36:41] PiratesZ: ECHO FOX OMEGALUL
[0:36:50] la7041831: who knows which caster today
[0:36:55] goblinguy01: He carried so hard on Jax, he lost them the game Kappa
[0:36:56] VingerX: @supervinlin_rulefive i jus wish they would bring grig back for the rest of the playoffs
[0:36:57] basement9411: Especially with Zvens lategame prowess and mechanca @supervinlin_rulefive
[0:36:58] PiratesZ: ME :)
[0:37:06] basement9411: @vingerx NOTY
[0:37:10] winwin311: WHEN DOES LGD PLAY OMEGALUL
[0:37:14] la7041831: i like dom btw
[0:37:22] VingerX: have you been watching his challenger games
[0:37:29] VingerX: grig has been in beast mode
[0:37:32] basement9411: hell no
[0:37:32] YSZN: also, imo top got so unlucky where they have to likely face a surging edg, ig and then probably rng if they make it that far
[0:37:40] rCRlMSON: Is this b03 or b05?
[0:37:49] SakuraEne: bo5
[0:37:49] basement9411: 5
[0:37:55] VingerX: 8
[0:37:56] rCRlMSON: Thank you
[0:38:06] rCRlMSON: :)
[0:38:07] flamazide: @YSZN honestly i feel like this is BETTER for TOP. they need to experience that type of thing. it isnt like they are used to playing at that level yet
[0:38:19] goblinguy01: I want Top to make it worlds, not EDG
[0:38:28] goblinguy01: EDG will lose in quarters as always
[0:38:33] FK_P: well, if TOP wins no one can say it was because of luck
[0:38:36] flamazide: i think all of us want top to make it to worlds instead of EDG haha
[0:38:42] VingerX: i think ig will step up their game
[0:39:02] flamazide: i think IG will continue to troll
[0:39:03] YSZN: @flamazide I don't see them beating ig, but if they make it to msi it's well deserved
[0:39:08] LaoWai42: you talkin bout worlds? msi hasnt even happened yet
[0:39:12] LoL_Frosted: 20 minutes?
[0:39:16] basement9411: No one ever talks about TSMs shotcalled TSM Smoothie. Dont let his tasty name fool you he will quickly and decisively put an end to any opponent.
[0:39:21] rosezhang: hi Stephen
[0:39:26] basement9411: shotcaller
[0:39:42] YSZN: @Laowai42 why not the worlds pic is easier to call with 3 seeds and regarded as more prestige
[0:39:48] CertainlySomeoneHere: Yo @Laowai42 , were you the one answering me on twitter?
[0:40:08] LaoWai42: uh i dont think so @CertainlySomeoneHere
[0:40:21] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Laowai42 then someone else from the production team
[0:40:27] basement9411: I heard steph curry might join TSM for next split
[0:40:28] rosezhang: thats probably me
[0:40:30] LaoWai42: true, but teams just change so much from spring to summer @YSZN
[0:40:31] CertainlySomeoneHere: Could you update !patch?
[0:40:38] LaoWai42: yes
[0:40:38] FK_P: bjergsen is like chovy, but better at every single thing
[0:40:39] VingerX: @CertainlySomeoneHere what did they say
[0:40:46] basement9411: @fk_p
[0:40:55] basement9411: true
[0:40:56] Volltar: skip song alpazelingKappa
[0:41:05] LaoWai42: @CertainlySomeoneHere @rosezhang said it was her

[2:11:33] qifa454: That aura is returning. If you've watched League of Legends longer than 2018, you know that aura. The TSM aura. The feeling that no matter how poorly the early game goes or how daunting the opponent, TSM, with one opening, can turn a certain loss to a beautiful, come-from-behind victory.

[2:11:51] rCRlMSON: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.
