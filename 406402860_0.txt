[1:11:47] kremlingremlins: @Clement_LoL They lost to 2 stomps vs WE in their previous series, mainly from early game mistakes, in reality it was still a really 50 50 matchup, so when i saw that jdg were nearly at 4.00 odds to win the series i was so surpsied and i look for value above all else

Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[2:27:18] 21044275: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Gala and early mid game domination with Xiaopeng and Changhong. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Mark is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.

[4:06:01] trisssmerigold: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess and early mid game domination. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. TSM and NA are finally back and playing like the best region in the world.
[4:06:01] Hoaw: I'm not a fan of any region or team, I am just a fan of whoever is playing the best League of Legends in the world. And right now, that just happens to be Team Solo Mid.
