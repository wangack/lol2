[1:09:26] Aradove: TOP fans wont be talking after another EZ 3-0 by SDG PogChamp
[1:09:31] mujarshad: I think EU format is most fair
[1:09:32] adroit5927: even C9 and Vit beat RNG at worlds
[1:09:36] Mazur1997: @IonIyTop g2 is probably most creative teams playing right now ,skt have problems with faker underperforming in some games
[1:09:41] hakari5: @mujarshad during renaming they opted a new format
[1:09:42] mylittlepony2016: TriHard xx
[1:09:43] 21044275: @adroit5927 RNG lost to the overall best region at worlds, nothing wrong with it
[1:09:51] hakari5: while NA didnt after discussing with teams
[1:09:58] 21044275: @adroit5927 EU > IG > LPL > NA >>> KR
[1:09:59] belacqua_: @adroit5927 they didn't adapt their style, also EDG beat KT at worlds
[1:10:24] mujarshad: EU format actually makes regular season matter
[1:10:27] adroit5927: it's not a matter of style, RNG's solo laners are garbage
[1:10:29] squishyviktor: hello
[1:10:34] belacqua_: @adroit5927 I know Griffin didn't go but neither did JDG and they were insanely strong last year they had to play like 5 bo5 in a row
[1:10:35] 21044275: KR was the 4th best region in 2018
[1:10:47] RNGDoom: UZI is good at bo3.But bo5 ...
[1:10:50] adroit5927: Yeah last year JDG was insane tbh

[1:11:02] HystericsCasts: I DON'T BELIEVE
[1:11:06] AKAROH: WeirdChamp
[1:11:08] HystericsCasts: it has to end now
[1:11:15] chrisrox22: @HystericsCasts D:
[1:11:18] adroit5927: Well wait for MSI, i think KR will win
[1:11:26] HystericsCasts: Knight will dumpset twila
[1:11:26] billup514wb: Am I not turtely enough for the Turtle club?
[1:11:29] HystericsCasts: dumpster*
[1:11:31] will_o_will: EU just want to make sure their best teams can go to worlds they give those teams second chances in case they mess up in playoffs
[1:11:33] 21044275: OH DAMN the casters are actually making predictions now rather than just saying the favorites
[1:11:35] xinhaochan: Koreans look like Nuguri
[1:11:40] AKAROH: EU format is set up for 2nd chance basically
[1:11:42] entropybill: knight has became the best domestic cn mid
[1:11:49] flamazide: i also expect knight to hard carry
[1:11:50] adroit5927: LPL has great mechanics but i think LCK teams are much smarter
[1:11:56] Aradove: @hystericscasts, DansGame DIDNT PREDICT SDG DansGame
[1:12:01] HystericsCasts: Yeah
[1:12:10] HystericsCasts: and I will predict FPX in the semis as well dont worry

[1:12:42] 21044275: @adroit5927 smarter means nothing in 2019, mechanics and proactive play makes the best team, this isn't old lol where its a farmfest
[1:12:42] HystericsCasts: BO5 yes
[1:12:43] perfectrotation7: yes
[1:12:48] Aradove: @hystericscasts, one does not predict agains GOD GALA
[1:12:55] myhemcph: thanks
[1:13:01] flamazide: wow in this context sdg look amazing. its kind of easy to forget how dominant they have been recently
[1:13:02] RNGDoom: all 1st
[1:13:03] sumosan3: RNG omegalul 4Head
[1:13:17] 21044275: @adroit5927 Riot has been changing the game for pro play to this exact moment cause they hate passive play, and the changes made lpl the best region with their aggressive plays
[1:13:29] adroit5927: @21044275 it's not about making it a farmfest, it's also decision making. LPL teams make so many mistakes and have horrible macro/decision making
[1:13:32] sumosan3: LGD?
[1:13:33] kevin0000cd: LGD= =?
[1:13:38] RNGDoom: LGD LUL
[1:13:39] beherhome: nobody?
[1:13:42] Benlan1994: I didn't expect that many western hommie care about LPL
[1:13:56] tobyzzzlpl: It's host in LGD home areana
[1:14:03] adroit5927: The best way is to combine aggression with clean macro play
[1:14:04] 21044275: @adroit5927 that hardly matters anymore, if it was old lol then bad macro would lose but not anymore, look at 2018 KR no international trophies
[1:14:06] RNGDoom: PogChamp
[1:14:09] michel_hah: Farenheit LUL
[1:14:09] perfectrotation7: HOMMIE

[1:14:20] AKAROH: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:14:22] Clement_LoL: Individually Knight has to be the best mid laner in LPL
[1:14:24] 21044275: @adroit5927 I honestly don
[1:14:25] chrisrox22: nisqy > knight9
[1:14:30] CertainlySomeoneHere: I love LPL , great casters, bearable chat, and cool production team :D
[1:14:36] AKAROH: LPL CHOVY Pog
[1:14:40] 21044275: don't know what you are thinking if you think LCK is still the strongest region
[1:14:40] entropybill: theLGD equal to TSM
[1:14:40] perfectrotation7: yall know asian ppl are germ freaks man. they play with masks on and a hazmat suit if they could
[1:14:50] adroit5927: btw thinking LCK can easily match LPL's mechanics
[1:14:51] HystericsCasts: @CertainlySomeoneHere thanks man, means a lot
[1:14:57] MaldororDream: @Clement_LoL Rookie is still th ebest bro
[1:15:03] belacqua_: @adroit5927 such a myth that all LPL teams have bad macro, different teams are better at diff things
[1:15:09] will_o_will: at least LPL teams can make plays...the willingness to take risks is why I love watching LPL
[1:15:18] adroit5927: GRF and SKT can easily match any LPL teams mechanics wise aside from IG
[1:15:32] chrisrox22: @lMaldoror i disagree this split knight9 is a monster
[1:15:46] Hoaw: Knight is best player in the world
[1:15:47] Clement_LoL: been a bit of an off split for Rookie to be honest
[1:15:51] CertainlySomeoneHere: @HystericsCasts :) It's just the impression I have. I enjoy being able to interact and talk about things. In this chat that's still possible, and all of you are very helpful and respond to questions a lot, which makes
[1:15:57] CertainlySomeoneHere: it just a lot of fun
[1:16:03] flamazide: i tried to get my friend to watch an lck game and she got really bored and said we're never doing that again
[1:16:06] adrianstent: Is TOP using its normal starting lineup?
[1:16:07] Clement_LoL: @CertainlySomeoneHere <3
[1:16:10] PepoMax: knight is so overated
[1:16:13] Dethrey: hmm
[1:16:17] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Clement_LoL certai1Love
[1:16:18] 포야: Gala SeemsGood
[1:16:18] PepoMax: let caps vs knight gg ez
[1:16:20] will_o_will: SKT is just a budgeted last year KT whether u agree or not
[1:16:22] adroit5927: the strongest mechanical players in LPL are pretty much koreans (theshy and rookie)
[1:16:23] IonIyTop: @adroid5927 SKT can easily match iG. Not sure about Griffin, Sword v TheShy would be pretty one sided in favor of IG
[1:16:25] belacqua_: @flamazide LUL
[1:16:27] niukasu1990: do you think knight is overhyped?
[1:16:37] Clement_LoL: @adrianstent yes they're playing with 369
[1:16:37] RNGDoom: I think Knight is better than Rookie BloodTrail
[1:16:38] adroit5927: Knight is overrated, watch him falter this series
[1:16:41] entropybill: knight will devastate Twila tonight
[1:16:45] belacqua_: @adroit5927 cmon dude that's just blatantly false
[1:16:50] adroit5927: knight playing like trash recently
[1:16:57] flamazide: @CertainlySomeoneHere thats also my favorite part of the twitch. it is more interactive than the other regions.
[1:17:02] adrianstent: @clement_lol Is xx and Ben both playing too?
[1:17:03] Hoaw: Knight > everybody else
[1:17:08] adroit5927: Nah theshy is on his own level
[1:17:18] adroit5927: Thinking Zoom is on theshy's level OMEGALUL
[1:17:19] niukasu1990: zoom is very closed to the shy but the shy is better
[1:17:23] AKAROH: theshy is insane
[1:17:32] Aradove: Twila > Faker DONT @ ME
[1:17:34] Clement_LoL: I think Knight as a solo player is amazing, but he does become very quiet when they're losing, he' also doesn't start things himself
[1:17:53] adroit5927: im not biased, im evaluating things objectively
[1:17:55] Clement_LoL: @adrianstent yep, they only have one jungler
[1:17:57] CertainlySomeoneHere: @flamazide Yeah! Well I expect it'll be harder if LPL grows bigger, but even then, it's still really interactive
[1:18:01] adroit5927: remember, no full chinese team won worlds
[1:18:08] adroit5927: cant argue with facts
[1:18:18] lazerbeeaamm: LCK ELITISTS LUL GO WATCH LCK BROADCAST AYYYYY OMEGALUL
[1:18:22] Hoaw: is there a maximum number of imports in china or can u have 5 koreans on 1 team?
[1:18:23] winwin311: Huni LUL
[1:18:28] RNGDoom: DoritosChip DoritosChip
[1:18:31] Clement_LoL: @adroit5927 well you only have 1 LPL team winning to begin with
[1:18:35] belacqua_: nah they didn't worlds, they just won everything else for the entire year, go watch LCK ResidentSleeper
[1:18:39] entropybill: Yeah actually Knight is exaggerated in China because he is domestic
[1:18:45] Clement_LoL: @1haman3 the rule is only 2 imports
[1:18:56] gangsteku: @adroit5927 go watch LCK then
[1:19:04] HystericsCasts: I mean no full NA team won worlds what is your point
[1:19:07] adroit5927: nah i like watching LPL
[1:19:16] flamazide: @CertainlySomeoneHere i think the LPL is always going to be the least popular western region because of the time it airs, korea's historic dominance, and the fact the chinese fans dont use the same platforms as western fans
[1:19:19] winwin311: is Doinb a chinese citizen now?
[1:19:22] Clement_LoL: @entropybill I think it has more to do with the fact he took over KR soloq no1 for months on end
[1:19:27] perfectrotation7: is this patch 9.6???
[1:19:37] HystericsCasts: Patch above pick phase lads
[1:19:39] HystericsCasts: 9.6
[1:19:44] Hoaw: @adroit5927 it doesn't really matter who won worlds. remember that your fame in this community comes from you as an individual player, it doesn't matter what your organization does
[1:19:46] 印度洋連勝文: is this patch 6.4?
[1:19:50] HystericsCasts: yes
[1:19:53] perfectrotation7: oh shit im blind af
[1:19:58] Clement_LoL: @flamazide spot on, we don't have a natural following since twitch twitter can't be used in China
[1:19:59] Hoaw: you have players like Bjergsen with 0 world wins and look how famous they are, because they have succeeded individually
[1:19:59] perfectrotation7: my bad dude im high as shit
[1:20:03] HystericsCasts: <3 it's okay
[1:20:12] winwin311: @21044275 how about rookie?
[1:20:15] HystericsCasts: Isn't his wife Korean?
[1:20:22] HystericsCasts: @Clement_LoL ?
[1:20:32] Clement_LoL: @HystericsCasts who?
[1:20:39] niukasu1990: no his wife is chinese
[1:20:42] AKAROH: bjerg is nutzs
[1:20:42] HystericsCasts: ah rip
[1:20:53] HystericsCasts: Helpful chat FeelsGoodMan
[1:21:00] 21044275: @winwin311 rookie has a chinese gf but isn't married yet so he remains Korean
[1:21:01] entropybill: XX has involved this year
[1:21:04] niukasu1990: will probably import doublelift
[1:21:11] AKAROH: so many insane mid laners..
[1:21:16] Clement_LoL: Importing players is a lot harder than most people think, culture wise the west is so different
[1:21:16] flamazide: i dont think knight is actually going to pick morg. im better shes support
[1:21:19] mylittlepony2016: @trihard_from_jail_cuh TriHard 7

[1:21:30] Dethrey: hmm looking forward to seeing Knight play mid, lets go
[1:21:37] adroit5927: but why does CN need to import players?
[1:21:43] adroit5927: look at EU's top teams, no imports
[1:21:44] dbxiu9: Loken vs Gala hype

[1:22:29] lazerbeeaamm: NO NEED TO KICK THEM
[1:22:31] niukasu1990: why sion still exist in the meta
[1:22:35] adroit5927: GG SDG ezwin
[1:22:52] flamazide: im sure youre happy about this draft 210
[1:23:00] entropybill: 369 is nominated as LPL the best rookie this year
[1:23:06] adroit5927: jankos is a great jungler
[1:23:06] Clement_LoL: SDG haave flashed shyvana before, feels like a mascot since they' have a dragon logo
[1:23:33] flamazide: is there a reason a lot of chinese players have 3 numbers for their names? 369, 957, i think there was one more
[1:23:39] adroit5927: not sure about this draft from TOP....
[1:23:42] winwin311: Go TOP!!
[1:23:42] flamazide: well i guess 3 isnt a lot but it is still odd to me
[1:23:53] Dethrey: sdg comp?
[1:23:54] perfectrotation7: g2 is my favorite team. perkz and jankos

[1:24:55] Clement_LoL: @cursedexistance TOP want priority in lane rather than teamfights, they have winning lanes in bot/top if it goes to 5v5 they lose anyway
[1:24:56] HystericsCasts: so I would have rather seen the Sion, think it's a small oversight but TOP play off of individuality, probably confidence
[1:25:18] nafisur22: chat which team is better tell me
[1:25:23] entropybill: SinoDragon has became a sensation in cn owing to all Chinese staff

[1:33:40] Dethrey: teh great escape
[1:33:51] cypressby: hoho
[1:34:02] adroit5927: @Clement_LoL Apparently Xx is the highest ranked player on KR solo
[1:34:03] goblinguy01: Top 3-0 EZ
[1:34:07] Clement_LoL: I really want to see JingMing play, FPX's sub jungler now rank 1, ppl hype tian, but it's gonna be funny if someone else plays
[1:34:10] saydollarsign: 369 CS Kreygasm
[1:34:23] Clement_LoL: @adroit5927 is that XX's account?
[1:34:23] adroit5927: Jingming is kindred one trick
[1:34:42] 21044275: zxcxxcvczxcxxcvc = Rookie
[1:34:44] kengonen1: xiaopeng is so agressive
[1:34:48] adroit5927: according to chinese netizens yeah, because xx is fan of mlxg and has similar playstyle
[1:34:55] gainpeace: kl
[1:35:10] Clement_LoL: huh, I don't think Xx fits soloq playstyle though
[1:35:13] 21044275: Also, isn't MingJing a kindred one trick
[1:35:27] entropybill: XX's surname is Xiong which means bear cub
[1:35:28] Clement_LoL: he's more more of a play through mid guy, don't think he and JingMing are the same guy
[1:35:37] kengonen1: @adroit5927 i think xiaopeng is more like mlxg
[1:36:02] Hoaw: TOP VS FPX WHEN ResidentSleeper
[1:36:31] winwin311: you mean iG VS FPX
[1:36:34] 카드레: Xiaopeng Kreygasm Kreygasm

[1:38:37] Benyeciz: It's so sad MSI is only 1 team per region
[1:38:38] strayquill: yall still think the kai + sion combo will remain undefeated
[1:38:42] adroit5927: xiaopeng is pretty high on kr soloq too
[1:39:21] Jacob96014: mods you're a bunch of fruit cakes
[1:39:41] Benyeciz: I'm so interested in both TOP and JDG playing internationally
[1:40:05] sumosan3: TOP or IG maybe
[1:40:07] lostpandawww: which two teams are most favored to make it to the finals?
[1:40:09] 21044275: I watched both EU and NA last night and I don't understand their meta
[1:40:17] 630096777: -1
[1:40:22] kengonen1: -10
[1:40:22] 21044275: NA why they like TP adc so much
[1:40:50] kengonen1: poor 369
[1:41:00] fast_turtle15: how do you get abused vs Sion? ...
[1:41:00] 大木博士官長: 367
[1:41:00] Benyeciz: I have to admit, NA meta is ineffective and their gameplay is not that high level, but man they are good in what they are doing
[1:41:04] 카드레: 369 BibleThump
[1:41:14] bobinzo: NA plays for late game since nobody knows how to close out games
[1:41:15] 大木博士官長: 369-2
[1:41:16] saydollarsign: 369 feeding LUL
[1:41:21] dbxiu9: na plays tp adc because others play tp adc
[1:41:24] adroit5927: TSM is gonna win worlds
[1:41:29] 21044275: I mean, does NA not have any Lee Sin players? No one play Lee
[1:41:36] 21044275: Every game is jarvan reksai
[1:41:59] des1gnw1za: tsm? LUL LUL LUL
[1:42:03] Clement_LoL: who's the best NA lee ever, outside of Rush?
[1:42:11] 630096777: lul
[1:42:13] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: NA 0-3d by FNC OMEGALUL
[1:42:20] adroit5927: xmithie is good at Lee
[1:42:21] alexyz1337: Dardoch
[1:42:29] dbxiu9: i think vici would 3 0 tsm too
[1:42:30] shogiriii: xmithie
[1:42:35] KingJerbear: I think Lee sin is a lot of risk so it's just safer not to play him. He's not super effective in late game unless you can make big play
[1:42:36] sumosan3: NA LUL
[1:42:37] LmaoLp: @Clement_LoL lira's lee was peak NA lee
[1:42:39] decco41: meteos
[1:42:41] 21044275: How do you even become a professional jungler without being good at Lee
[1:42:43] saydollarsign: fnatic will win worlds
[1:42:52] thecampingbushx: dardoch by far
[1:42:53] adroit5927: best lee right now is probably karsa tbh
[1:43:03] Benyeciz: As for EU meta, basically every team plays their own meta and there are little overlaps between the teams' playstyles. I'm a bit disappointed in the EU playoffs level of play also.
[1:43:07] Clement_LoL: Lee isn't a must in the meta most of the times
[1:43:11] dbxiu9: Clid
[1:43:14] fast_turtle15: Clid?
[1:43:19] fast_turtle15: it's close tbh
[1:43:28] adroit5927: karsa has insane winrate on lee in kr soloq
[1:43:28] LmaoLp: lee is a must if you're a decent jungler tho @Clement_LoL
[1:43:40] absolg: broxah best lee in the world
[1:43:40] KingJerbear: Maybe for solo queue
[1:43:44] saydollarsign: EZ GANK
[1:43:56] adroit5927: if you look at some stats on soloq online, karsa's lee in like number 2 in the world
[1:44:03] 21044275: @KingJerbear all the best junglers in lol history since S3 has been very good Lee players
[1:44:09] dbxiu9: broxah is a lee player who uses ult and flash for a support kill
[1:44:11] Jacob96014: they're saying Lee is what every jungler should master because of the mechanical skills required to play him. master him, other junlgers are easy
[1:44:12] adroit5927: so mechanically karsa is really insane on lee
[1:44:39] KingJerbear: @21044275 i know, it's certainly not a must for current meta, this isnt s3
[1:44:54] adroit5927: kanavi is also an insane lee player too
[1:45:01] 21044275: @KingJerbear RNG vs JDG Lee picked all 5 games
[1:45:06] 21044275: Lee picked this game
[1:45:22] adroit5927: GRF kanavi is even better than Tarzan mechanically
[1:45:25] saydollarsign: @21044275 ?? LUL WHAT R U TALKING LUL SPEAK ENGLISH PLEASE
[1:45:27] KingJerbear: So how does that mean it's a must-play? Because it was picked?
[1:45:29] LmaoLp: @21044275 cursedexistance: lee is a must if you're a decent jungler tho @Clement_LoL
[1:45:41] Benyeciz: Lee is one of the evergreen champions that will always be viable at least as a B tier jungler
[1:45:53] LmaoLp: if you cant lee gtfo of pro jungle
[1:46:07] Jacob96014: I miss season 4 and backwards. even in the semifinals there were constant team fights and all out scraps. it was awesome. these days it's so conservative it's boring to watch
[1:46:08] Clement_LoL: @cursedexistance I agree on the point that I expect most pro junglers to be able to play him, what I meant is just he's still more of a flavor pick than a staple in most metas
[1:46:12] KingJerbear: Lee is just high risk high return, can win you the game but can also lose the game
[1:46:14] 21044275: @cursedexistance 80% of NA junglers would be jobless
[1:46:32] dbxiu9: 60% of na junglers are stealing paychecks
[1:46:36] saydollarsign: GALA DELETED.
[1:46:38] adroit5927: lol gala nice
[1:46:40] KingJerbear: Na Junglers can play Lee it's just not played in the NA LCS meta
[1:46:43] mylittlepony2016: LUL

[1:46:45] adroit5927: what a dumbo
[1:46:48] LmaoLp: @21044275 so... who else other than lira can play a good lee in na? 🤔
[1:46:51] PreacherCasts: I'm with Clement on this one. Lee Sin hasn't been mandatory pick/ban since S4
[1:46:52] 630096777: ADC in 2019 LUL
[1:46:54] myhemcph: 3 2 2?
[1:47:09] winwin311: Lee LUL
[1:47:10] saydollarsign: Xiaopeng ?? LUL
[1:47:10] Benyeciz: almost every native NA player is there because there is an import limit and the majority of imports is also there to just jerk off tbh

[1:47:29] Jacob96014: @cursedexistance sven can play a really good lee. a lot of NA jg can play lee. Lee is just not in NA meta atm
[1:47:33] lazerbeeaamm: OMEGALUL
[1:47:35] LmaoLp: @Clement_LoL he's a flavour pick for sure, but he's never irrelevant because of his utility, if you don't have him in your staple picks you can't be a pro jger.
[1:47:42] mylittlepony2016: GG GALA well played LUL
[1:47:52] 21044275: I still don't understand how a player like Impact is making 1 million a year, he is garbage compared to all lpl and lck tops
[1:47:56] LmaoLp: @Jacob96014 most na lee is horrible though
[1:47:57] Jacob96014: @cursedexistance totally agree with that

[1:49:26] KingJerbear: Haven't played Lee since Spirit of the Elder Lizard was the jam
[1:49:38] Clement_LoL: I think Varus/Ashe are so underatted by WE/RNG, winning lane makes the game so much easier than hard locking Kaisa/Vayne
