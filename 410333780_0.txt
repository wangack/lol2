[1:02:23] EsportsTj: @nomegalulrth it's actually super normal for people being interviewed to want to hold the mic. No one is quite sure what to do with their hands. Super scary if you are hosting though.
[1:02:33] EsportsTj: You kinda loose control of the broadcast If you are not holding the mic
[1:02:38] 21044275: Either Doinb is tall as fuck, or the girl is short as fuck

[3:35:18] ganjalabum: stop saying griffin is bad and stop making fun of them. they played really good but unfortunately lost to SKTgays because of choking. BUT THEY ARE NOT BAD, I promise you that they're better than all of you iron scrubs. you always think you are better than pros, but why are they pros and not you???
[3:35:18] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: First of all, I'm a Grandmaster player and have analyzed all LPL/LCK games for several years. Griffin was incredibly bad and basically pubstomped low-tier rosters that were thrown together. They didn't choke. They just were not good in best of 5 format because as a team they were not good. It's really simple.
[3:35:19] siN_SKYlash: I'm sad because grf got hard stomped:(
[3:35:19] Duxtons_: TSM HAHAHAHAHHA
[3:35:19] belacqua_: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess and early mid game domination. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. TSM is finally back and honestly playing like the best team in the world.

You have Doublelift, so called because he can carry twice as hard as any other ADC, backed up by Xmithie, a man who is so accurate with his Sejuani ultimates Riot had to program a number generator just to make sure he misses at least 40% of them to keep it fair to the enemy.
