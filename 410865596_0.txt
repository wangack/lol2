[1:17:48] trisssmerigold: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TL you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess and early mid game domination. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. TL is back again and honestly playing like the best team in the world.

[2:32:59] trisssmerigold: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TL you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess and early mid game domination. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. TL is back again and honestly playing like the best team in the world.

Which I agree is a big thing for a team that isn`t at the top, but they can`t even repeat it at a regional level, with the same exact team. So the second best team on the planet can`t do well on a smal UAE league? (After all they are still the last runner up on FIFA club world cup)
