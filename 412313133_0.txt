[0:07:34] LmaoLp: @High420 given they're playing for third place, i think reading that should answer your question
[0:07:42] reaperbuff2v: same its a real stuggle in elo hell
[0:07:58] ChrisKringle: doinb>>>>>faker
[0:08:13] goblinguy01: DoinB is good, but struggles when it matters :(
[0:08:21] goblinguy01: I wish QG went to worlds for China instead of LGD
[0:08:49] lehansen: who wins ?
[0:09:02] callofc: RNG
[0:09:03] goblinguy01: IG wins since theShy is the best top laner in the world
[0:09:08] widepeepoHappy_Clap: the LPL all kinda take games off eachother, other than iG probably being #1 the rest is kinda up for debate.
[0:09:21] mbappe_hazard: !PATCH
[0:09:21] Moobot: @mbappe_hazard This is patch 9.6 POGGERS
[0:09:57] ThatGuyWithGlasses: LUL JDG could barely win against JDG and FPP
[0:10:13] goblinguy01: IG is insane when TheShy has to carry
[0:10:25] 000000a1: LETS GO FPX
[0:10:26] goblinguy01: I really hope IG wins their LPL title

[0:11:21] NightHowii: OK
[0:11:22] Catova: Who do you guys think is going to take today's match
[0:11:25] doubleptrem: ARE THESE Ppl good?

[0:11:50] LaoWai42: @ThatGuyWithGlasses i guessed as much just wanted to give you a hard time
[0:11:51] Grondjuice0: HAHAHAHA NO. top 5 teams are 2 kr and 3 lpl
[0:11:53] mifzy_follower: @singurarity one were 1st in the split

[0:12:35] nanosamadaisuki: G2 lmao
[0:12:46] Catova: Man, being objective right now, G2 is a better overall team
[0:12:48] lapercog: SourPls
[0:12:48] goblinguy01: Imp isn't that good, and Yagao/Flawless have been inting in the last few series
[0:12:53] h011ywood: NA LUL
[0:12:54] widepeepoHappy_Clap: g2 would 9-0 TL in a bo17
[0:12:57] LaoWai42: @goblibguy01 i dunno imp looks reenergized
[0:13:00] 루키팬: faker or rookie who is better?
[0:13:13] spartaman64: rookie LUL

[0:13:22] spartaman64: LUL
[0:13:27] goblinguy01: @Laowai42 Imp still has it, but he needs to practice xD. Yagoo/Flawless are 2 or 10 players :(
[0:13:29] h011ywood: fakers has been overrated for years
[0:13:30] Catova: those 2 in the screen have been performing better during the split than faker and rookie
[0:13:37] goblinguy01: Yagao was afk in some games against RNG
[0:13:38] lapercog: @Laowai42 shipOK / hey man
[0:13:40] croowniie: rookie
[0:13:51] 亞洲之鷹: music name?

[0:14:47] 亞洲之鷹: many "new" faker
[0:14:49] LmaoLp: @Catova mostly agree. rookie has still had higher highs this split than doinb with some consistency to that, but doinbs average level has defo been consistently higher. if that makes sense
[0:14:52] nomegalulrth: Froggen> Faker
[0:14:58] 0dd__: Huhi > Faker

[0:15:52] nanosamadaisuki: @lapercog ship7
[0:15:58] 0dd__: Doinb was looking so good until FPX crashed and burned BibleThump
[0:16:00] goblinguy01: No stomps like SKT vs. Griffin
[0:16:04] LmaoLp: nah his performance dropped off a cliff at the start of the split, he's been getting better and had some pop off games but it's not quite as convincing as he used to be
[0:16:28] Catova: ye, i don't think Rookie's been underperforming or anything but this split LPL's super high level (top teams)
[0:16:30] nomegalulrth: theshy vs Zoom waiting room ResidentSleeper
[0:16:38] nanosamadaisuki: IG aside from Ning were all kinda trolling before lunar new year LUL
[0:16:39] LmaoLp: last try i think
[0:16:47] goblinguy01: TheShy vs Impact OMEGALUL
[0:16:51] NoTearCN: When is final?
[0:17:01] nomegalulrth: Sat I think
[0:17:12] LaoWai42: @NoTearCN April 21st, 3:30 pm CST
[0:17:13] LmaoLp: yeah, current song is Last Try from the album Infectious LA Pop
[0:17:20] 루키팬: Kiin vs The shy
[0:17:21] 0dd__: Vietnam is going to become the 3rd best region at MSI NaM
[0:17:22] AnOldDinosaur: Wait fpx didn’t make it to the grand finals? I thought they were basically unbeaten last i saw
[0:17:26] Catova: @cursedexistance actually ye, he started the split not so well
[0:17:27] NoTearCN: @laowai42 thx
[0:17:37] LaoWai42: np
[0:17:39] LmaoLp: artists eddy gronfier, orion navaille and kimberly lundy liope
[0:17:42] goblinguy01: is LMS still a major region? They lost so much talent to the LPL
[0:17:48] nomegalulrth: @AnOldDinosaur the dreamy boy caps wanted differently
[0:17:54] nanosamadaisuki: @AnOldDinosaur They lost to JDG 3-2
[0:17:59] danilomurattini: TOP or FPX ?
[0:18:04] danilomurattini: Who win ???
[0:18:05] LmaoLp: @Catova it honestly looked like he'd played maybe 50 games of league since worlds tops
[0:18:16] LmaoLp: @BENCHAMAZINGJ yw, i actually bought the album and enjoy the whole thing
[0:18:17] lapercog: @Laowai42 does the stream delayed like usual or the match played on realtime this time? shipTHINK
[0:18:21] Catova: Well they're considered a major but idk..
[0:18:23] danilomurattini: Guys TOP or FPX ??? Who ll win ???
[0:18:39] LaoWai42: @lapercog like usual?
[0:18:47] nomegalulrth: I think Fpx takes it
[0:18:49] AnOldDinosaur: Jdg could win it all then huh. That’s a PogChamp
[0:19:11] 루키팬: TheShy vs Zoom who will be win
[0:19:16] goblinguy01: I hope Riot takes it away from LMS if they fail out of groups at MSI
[0:19:17] LmaoLp: california boys, from the same album @BENCHAMAZINGJ
[0:19:21] nanosamadaisuki: TheShy <3
[0:19:32] goblinguy01: FW lost all their players and coaches. Warhouse and Steak coaches in the LPL.
[0:19:42] Catova: @danmaaku They probably will
[0:19:52] 白嚕嚕: top gg
[0:19:57] 0dd__: MSI/Worlds seeding is always determined by performance at the events, so LMS is probably already going to have to go through the wildcard qualifier
[0:19:59] lapercog: @Laowai42 like the second match already played on the stadium, but the first match just began on twitch
[0:20:06] ark110: i was kidding geez
[0:20:31] proteinmaster69: when are finals
[0:20:33] LmaoLp: @Arhowe LMS and NA get round 2 seeded, will have to play vs wildcard teams that progress
[0:20:52] Admiralcholo: PepePls
[0:21:01] proteinmaster69: is IG in finals
[0:21:08] nomegalulrth: yes
[0:21:10] ark110: IG Gonna crush SKT in MSI, u heard it here boys dont @ me
[0:21:15] proteinmaster69: vs JDG?
[0:21:15] nomegalulrth: ig and jdg
[0:21:20] kutoriiii: ig vs jdg
[0:21:30] nanosamadaisuki: @ark110 oddoneWeird
[0:21:32] proteinmaster69: jdg wonnerined?
[0:21:34] Admiralcholo: @ark110 Kappa
[0:21:34] LaoWai42: @lapercog considering there is only one bo5 today there would be no situation where a delay is necessary
[0:21:35] LmaoLp: @BENCHAMAZINGJ the other song from the album that plays on here sometimes is "Where I belong" which was the song that got me to look up the album :P
[0:21:48] 0dd__: @cursedexistance Either LMS or NA is going to lose to Vietnam then LUL
[0:22:00] AnOldDinosaur: PogChamp
[0:22:00] goblinguy01: I can see both lol
[0:22:01] nomegalulrth: IG should be favored vs SKT atm
[0:22:01] ark110: IG will win 100% against JDG be 3-1
[0:22:03] LaoWai42: but saying like usual is a bit far fetched, we only delay when absolutely necessary and only in the regular season
[0:22:08] goblinguy01: NA titls against Vietname, and LMS is so so
[0:22:29] lapercog: @Laowai42 thank god then shipOK i dont have to closed the chat because of spoilers shipOK
[0:23:00] leezx9: 4.21
[0:23:02] LmaoLp: @Arhowe and whoever isn't losing to vietnam, will end up losing to the Bombers from OPL
[0:23:08] LmaoLp: : ' )
[0:23:19] 0dd__: This'll be the year OPL makes it past wildcard Kappa
[0:23:23] Clairfoyance: wats the point of 3rd place match LUL
[0:23:24] goblinguy01: I see TL losing a map to Vietnam
[0:23:25] nomegalulrth: OMEGALUL PL
[0:23:36] kutoriiii: sunday
[0:23:49] Nazonokusa: Any OMEGALUL CE Players in chat?
[0:23:57] LmaoLp: @Lofi_Chill generally, it's to determine who gets 3rd and who gets 4th. 🤔
[0:24:00] fireespitter: time for the REAL finals
[0:24:06] 0dd__: oce player here FeelsBadMan
[0:24:11] Kuiper_Blue: Wouldn't be the first time America got stomped in 'nam
[0:24:13] Clairfoyance: @cursedexistance but why, its not like they get medal for 3rd 4Head
[0:24:23] LmaoLp: @Lofi_Chill more prize money iirc
[0:24:30] LaoWai42: @Lofi_Chill championship points and prize money
[0:24:31] fireespitter: did someone say NaM ?
[0:24:32] LmaoLp: so there is actually incentive to play :p
[0:24:49] scottoflorida2014: 34 years
[0:24:57] 0dd__: NaM 👉
[0:25:02] goblinguy01: Good chance 3rd seed takes their advantage to worlds gauntlet
[0:25:02] AnOldDinosaur: JDG 3-0 IG KappaHD
[0:25:03] 세체팀케이티: this match is determined 3rd winner???
[0:25:06] kutoriiii: 3rd will against kz, 4th will against dwg
[0:25:14] Clairfoyance: @cursedexistance @Laowai42 for few hundred bucks u make teams practice for a week OMEGALUL
[0:25:17] kutoriiii: in rr
[0:25:24] goblinguy01: I forgot Rift Rivals
[0:25:36] 0dd__: Yeah, Asian rift rivals still has 4 teams from each region anyways though right
[0:25:43] nushcefac: sadsf
[0:25:51] LaoWai42: @Lofi_Chill a difference of 200,000 rmb
[0:26:06] 0dd__: Doinb at Rift Rivals again FeelsGoodMan
[0:26:07] fireespitter: RR before or after msi?
[0:26:12] Clairfoyance: i still think LCK playoff format is the best, and most fair, doesnt have any pointless matches
[0:26:47] nomegalulrth: LEC is the superior format
[0:26:51] BlindxRanger: ResidentSleeper
[0:26:58] goblinguy01: Losers bracket is balanced
[0:27:08] nomegalulrth: In korea number 1 seed doesnt play for 3 weeks which makes them rusty
[0:27:11] goblinguy01: IpL5
[0:27:30] nanosamadaisuki: LEC playoff format >>
[0:27:47] Kuiper_Blue: LEC's format is pretty good tbh
[0:28:05] nomegalulrth: Lcs format is the worst what
[0:28:09] goblinguy01: LEC is fair
[0:28:15] goblinguy01: You get two chances to make it finals
[0:28:15] Clairfoyance: yea still dont get why Lol esports wont adopt losers bracket LUL
[0:28:23] 0dd__: LCK's format is the worst IMO, not even 5th vs 4th gets a BO3
[0:28:25] Kuiper_Blue: LCS is too prone to upsets for the top 2 seeds
[0:28:31] 0dd__: a bo5*
[0:28:40] LmaoLp: @Lofi_Chill time constraints and demands put on players. they'd rather just one and done it
[0:28:56] 황금뗑컨: when lpl final?
[0:29:03] Clairfoyance: @cursedexistance wat demands on players LUL i think most players would appreciate it
[0:29:03] goblinguy01: @cursedexistance That attitude is why NA fails at worlds or any international majors LUL
[0:29:09] goblinguy01: Nice excuse on hard work
[0:29:15] 황금뗑컨: thx
[0:29:21] Clairfoyance: @cursedexistance actually less pressure on them
[0:29:26] 0dd__: NA swapped back to Bo1 for viewers sake LUL
[0:29:29] nomegalulrth: @cursedexistance time constaints is a bad excuse because during worlds you have so much dead time
[0:29:43] LmaoLp: imagine seasons back when skt and jag had that 94 minute thriller. now make that not just one, but two bo5's, so you couldve needed 3x94min x2.. imagine if it were scheduled for the same day
[0:29:48] CptRexBuckingham: M OMEGALUL DS
[0:30:10] spartaman64: too much work can be a bad thing and burn out the players just ask shanghai dragons
[0:30:16] silverwing39: it wont happen because the game changed
[0:30:32] 0dd__: Yeah minion wave acceleration and double cannons late made it impossible for games to go super late
[0:30:39] silverwing39: game snowballs harder now
[0:31:07] goblinguy01: Why do NA fans keep making excuses for their bad results
[0:31:24] PrinceArtemis: Cause TSM
[0:31:30] goblinguy01: It's poor attitude, lack of practice and no structure is why they perform so badly at International majors
[0:31:35] nanosamadaisuki: TSM shipHANDS
[0:31:35] Clairfoyance: @cursedexistance now tats taking it too far LUL
[0:31:36] LmaoLp: sure, its changed currently, who's to say it can't change back towards that? that example was legit 9.4 hours of solid play, even if it were "only" 50 minute games, that could still push it out to 6 hours of constant playtime, probably 8 hours with the breaks between etc
[0:31:40] BE61k: how long before this chat turns straight racist again?
[0:31:41] SpunkyPunky: I live in NA and I'll be the first to say NA sucks and is no where near the level of any other region
[0:31:45] akordas: its harder to win lpl when worlds
[0:31:46] blottedbrain: cobaltBow
[0:31:54] goblinguy01: EU, China, LMS, Korea, Turkiye, Vietnam doesn't make excuses on losing
[0:31:54] SpunkyPunky: there is no reason to send a NA team to MSI or worlds
[0:32:05] spartaman64: ?
[0:32:08] 0dd__: NA is built around importing second-tier Korean players they will never have top tier talent LUL
[0:32:09] goblinguy01: Korea lost last year worlds, they fixed it lol
[0:32:09] PrinceArtemis: I want Sneakyc9 to cosplay as Bowsette
[0:32:13] silverwing39: riot can just make adjustments if games keep dragging out
[0:32:19] SpunkyPunky: you wouldn't have an athlete from the special olympics participate in the regular olympics
[0:32:40] LaoWai42: @SpunkyPunky woah that is uncalled for calm it down there
[0:32:41] Kuiper_Blue: @PrinceArtemis Boi do I have news for you
[0:32:44] LmaoLp: @goblibguy01 i'm not a fan of na for the record, i think currently the west as a whole sits below the east, the closest to pierce the veil is likely to be current g2.
[0:32:50] spartaman64: i mean there are wildcard regions
[0:32:52] SpunkyPunky: its not wrong though
[0:32:56] blottedbrain: cobalt1 cobalt2
[0:32:58] goblinguy01: That's why IG won worlds right? They didn't practice and goofed all year Kappa
[0:33:00] 0dd__: Oscar Pistorious was in the summer olympics though 🤔
[0:33:03] 阿璃的小鮑包: 8>1
[0:33:04] LaoWai42: i mean it objectively is
[0:33:05] silverwing39: patches are like every 2 weeks
[0:33:10] iPepeTV: Doinb <3
[0:33:10] SpunkyPunky: how
[0:33:15] PrinceArtemis: @Alender265 Oh snap hes already done it lol
[0:33:33] spartaman64: NA deserves to be a worlds the way LJL deserves to be at worlds LUL
[0:33:33] SpunkyPunky: in what way does TL match up to any of the owrthwhile teams
[0:33:57] goblinguy01: I'm not saying, "Na sucks." I made good points on people making excuses
[0:34:00] LaoWai42: 1. NA has made it to finals in MSI and made it to semis in worlds proving they can be competitive 2. there have been special olypic athletes that have in fact competed in the olympics
[0:34:00] 0dd__: I'm not 100% convinced LCK is above EU yet, but I'll eat my words if G2 shits the bed at MSI Kappa
[0:34:01] nomegalulrth: Caps dream buff> Doinb wife buff
[0:34:06] goblinguy01: How does FNC perform so well against top tier teams?
[0:34:12] PrinceArtemis: Sadly Faker will take the gold again cause he wants his crown back
[0:34:18] FizzStayNight: LPL less viewers than LCK promotion tournament LUL FeelsBadMan
[0:34:22] 0dd__: NA made it to semifinals once in 8 years wow PogChamp
[0:34:27] Kuiper_Blue: I'm honestly interested in seeing how G2's style will fare up against actually good teams with clean games
[0:34:39] BE61k: it's better if worlds has every region regardless of skill, more interesting imo
[0:34:42] goblinguy01: FNC faced Royal Club in s3, they didn't have an easy road. Yet, they still took a map off Royal Club
[0:34:49] SpunkyPunky: CoreJJ is the only good NA player compared to the rest of the world, but he is a support and there is a limit to what he can do
[0:34:55] SpunkyPunky: Huni used top be good, but he isn't now
[0:35:01] GenuineLGN: @fizzstaynight dont bring up veiwer statistics or someone will bring the chinese sites with millions of bots into the argument monkaS
[0:35:01] spartaman64: probably most people are watching on other platforms with the population of china theres no way less people are watching any LPL match
[0:35:03] btaaffe5: Anyone know if this is best of 3 or 5??
[0:35:03] himself4396: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:35:03] profdamata: @fizzstaynight Channel name pls
[0:35:20] C_NORMOUS: rip ryze
[0:35:22] nomegalulrth: g2s solo lanes will do fine. The question is their botlane especially with mikyx still injured

[4:28:56] leftyytwo: PagChomp
[4:29:02] 1kenn1: that FPX jacket Kreygasm
[4:29:05] AyyItsMacie: Personally I am not sure if TL stands a chance. I feel like TL is similar to OG in their approach, but maybe I underestimate them
[4:29:05] armandvanheldenn: how did they clinch worlds spot already ?
[4:29:06] cleaaryisgod: FPX get summer split top 3 will comfirm Worlds
[4:29:11] 630096777: BibleThump

[4:29:21] soundpraenk: G2 won't be that good on MSI but probably going to be insane on Worlds when team is more time together
[4:29:28] Fustilio: wait isn't kikis best jungler world? Keepo

[4:30:05] Jotrha: isnt MSI going to be a tank meta or smth? will help impact a lot seeing as wunder, khan, etc are scary
[4:30:05] Kuiper_Blue: TL is like OG, which is to say a worse Korean team, so I'm not too confident in their ability to perform against international teams
[4:30:07] yudai95: can khan play tanks?
[4:30:11] satanico777: CmonRaz

[4:31:23] Kuiper_Blue: @Arnej35 I concur, I just feel like both TL and OG are Korean-style teams with unclean games
[4:31:27] IndeKappa: @handonface he said tanks will be meta? LUL LS
[4:31:31] HystericsCasts: Actually an Atlus, Papa & Raz cast, has that happened yet?
[4:31:31] mrdeadpool16: hello HeyGuys
[4:31:38] armandvanheldenn: @HystericsCasts can you explain how did they clinch a worlds spot already ?

[4:31:53] alexlipson: Let's be real. SKT and iG are the only teams that can contest G2 properly rn. Every other team is going to get beaten, some even smashed 3-0.

[4:32:24] Jovw: Tian = the next big thing
[4:32:24] mathematicianYo: !papa
[4:32:24] AyyItsMacie: I don't think G2 is as good as people make them out to be, same with TL
[4:32:26] HystericsCasts: number 2 imo this split has been Zoom/Gimgoon
[4:32:30] soundpraenk: @Alender265 i believe, TL got better jungle, bot lane a if tank meta is gonna be on MSI, even top laner
[4:32:36] AyyItsMacie: I think MSI this year will be very very interesting
[4:32:38] handonface: @IndeKappa I think he is saying the patch that MSI will play on is giving large buffs directly and indirectly to tanks and tank killers.
[4:32:40] yudai95: its gonna be tank meta at MSI
[4:32:41] chillerspoon: Zoom is bonkers.
[4:32:51] schroeter97: where win?
[4:32:54] vvxda: MingLee
[4:32:55] fridaychill: Tank meta is really prevelent now
[4:32:56] HystericsCasts: Captain Jack is getting me hyped for his finals run into IG
[4:32:58] yudai95: @Arnej35 dude, fnc had betetr jgl and bot lane than OG, looked what ah^ppened to them
[4:33:02] alexlipson: Tank meta isn't going to happen anytime soon LUL
[4:33:02] HystericsCasts: Remember in the regular split JDG beat IG
[4:33:02] AyyItsMacie: Reddit is rarely right, remember that
[4:33:05] EU_AT_RIFT_RIVALS_LUL: most of the tops going to msi are carry players. its gonna be a carry meta
[4:33:09] ash_7: is it over or 2-2?
[4:33:29] handonface: @HystericsCasts IG vs JDG should be really good hopefully
[4:33:36] crispycoolwells: Yo who is first place
[4:33:38] IndeKappa: @handonface im biased here since i dont want a tank meta, but i find really hard to believe ls after some bs he said lately
[4:33:41] AverageUgandan: @hystericscasts Alright, how many Korean top are their is you know?
[4:33:42] DCFDTL: is it time to overhype NA again? EleGiggle
[4:33:44] HystericsCasts: I am predicting JDG POGGERS
[4:33:53] vvxda: MingLee
[4:33:54] schroeter97: over or 2:2?
[4:33:57] hushurdad: FPX WON?
[4:33:57] soundpraenk: @yudai95 honestly i feel like FNC had really bad day, i think they are slightly better than OG, their first two games were just mess
[4:33:58] yudai95: @Arnej35 OG is really strong cause they play well togheter, not necesairly because of individual talent
[4:33:58] AyyItsMacie: I'm so hyped for MSI rooSip
[4:34:07] Rainybellz: guys, where is RNG?
[4:34:12] TrantaLocked: information density on lpl casting is like twice as much as lck jesus
[4:34:18] Draguhx: At home
[4:34:21] nerska123: @AyyItsMacie iG will win it
[4:34:23] fridaychill: If Jindong wins against IG I'm eating a god damn sock @HystericsCasts
[4:34:29] DCFDTL: 9.8 wont make tank meta btw, barely any changes
[4:34:37] HystericsCasts: We have 7 including Duke
[4:34:49] soundpraenk: @yudai95 we will see on rift rivals how good OG actually is
[4:34:51] DCFDTL: cinderhulk doesn't affect top laners NotLikeThis
[4:34:52] HystericsCasts: ADD, Ray, GimGoon, Duke/TheShy, Poss & Jinoo
[4:34:53] montymorancy: until kaisa/vyane get nerfed, meta cant be tank
[4:34:58] crazyfoxali: no one will know who will win, LPL top teams are real close
[4:35:01] acroboi: DansGame
[4:35:03] handonface: @IndeKappa I dont mind the meta but I can feel for not wanting one. im not biased for or against LS but his game knowledge wether I like it or not is on point most of the time. Wether the players themselves play tanks is up to them.
[4:35:07] vaggoslegend: league of conversation and monologue

[4:35:29] tryharderlul: @papasmithy
[4:35:38] Rainybellz: LPL podcast? EleGiggle
[4:35:41] fridaychill: I'll hold that bet. That's a promise
[4:35:42] IndeKappa: also tanks are too weak in laning phase, g2 will just snowball the game from turret plates
[4:35:43] AverageUgandan: Alright @hystericscasts didn't know Gimgoon was korean
[4:35:43] handonface: IG needs to do a shoey if they win! LUL
[4:35:46] aatroxqin: ?
[4:35:47] vaggoslegend: chat are any games left to be played or we done????
[4:35:50] yudai95: @handonface i mean ls does sometimes go too far with his predictions
[4:35:51] wisdombro: @Naykir lets be real IG are better player for player in every position compared to G2. G2 are amazing but this IG team is exceptional
[4:35:54] husbandsama: WutFace
[4:35:59] HystericsCasts: Yeah a lot of people just generally forget him as a toplaner but I put him as top 4 for sure

[4:37:20] itshafa: ooohh I like that graphic
[4:37:25] DCFDTL: MSI is a race for LPL/LCK/LEC, forget about anyone else
[4:37:26] vaggoslegend: fined
[4:37:30] HystericsCasts: 8th vs 2nd lets fucking get it
[4:37:32] wisdombro: @yudai95 support maybe but no way is jankos better then ning
[4:37:33] handonface: @HystericsCasts I think its going to be playstyle > players IMO.
[4:37:34] vvxda: MingLee
[4:37:34] alexlipson: @nerska123 SKT performs always when they have to. Calling them overrated after smashing Griffin that hard shouldn't be a thing anymore

[4:38:11] yanos33: morning Kappa
[4:38:12] AverageUgandan: @hystericscasts Gim has been playing good
[4:38:15] nerska123: @Naykir Griffin is a legit last years TOP4 team, last year everyone on LCK except KT was trash
[4:38:17] eternalexalted: FPX 3-1?

[4:38:25] HystericsCasts: @Toiletvann true!
[4:38:27] handonface: @HystericsCasts In that sense it makes for a really really nice MSI.
[4:38:28] TrantaLocked: griffin choked hard, at theyre peak they shouldve won finals
[4:38:33] nerska123: @Naykir Not to mention griffin lost to the top7+ teams alst weeks of regular season
[4:38:45] thesenseiofmayhem: who won

[4:38:58] HystericsCasts: Prophet caps incoming
[4:39:02] nerska123: @HystericsCasts iG will win
[4:39:05] alexlipson: @nerska123 No one cares to who they lost the last matches of the season, they already won the split. No reason to try hard and show things ResidentSleeper
[4:39:05] handonface: @TrantaLocked I dont even want to say choked. There was something so off about that whole series.
[4:39:14] HystericsCasts: I will reveal my prediction in 4 days monkaS
[4:39:16] vvxda: MingLee
[4:39:23] Noveris: everyone talking about MSI predictions, caps already leaked the script, g2 vs jdg finals
[4:39:35] handonface: Zoom vs TheShy monkaS
[4:39:35] wisdombro: One thing for sure is that TL is going to be destroyed, specifically Impact lul
[4:39:42] eternalexalted: GRF inted OMEGALUL it was as if SKT bribed them :(
[4:39:43] jumanjigang: who won
[4:39:43] nerska123: @Naykir Griffin played like absolute shit, jsut saying
[4:39:45] yanos33: @nerska123 you really don't give skt a chance to win msi? interesting LUL
[4:39:52] HystericsCasts: FPX 3 - 1 TOP
[4:39:57] DCFDTL: @Noveris he didn't leak the script, he MADE the script
[4:39:58] jumanjigang: lets gooo
[4:40:03] TrantaLocked: @handonface like actual scripted/bribed
[4:40:05] MonkeyDLuffy10911: LUL
[4:40:06] nerska123: @yanos33 Not a single one if iG is there
[4:40:06] alexlipson: iG will 3-1 JDG, sorry guys :(
[4:40:07] DCFDTL: he's the writer
[4:40:12] fast_turtle15: I actually have no idea how Caps even had a dream about that lol
[4:40:13] AyyItsMacie: Duke rooAww
[4:40:16] MonkeyDLuffy10911: Who won?
[4:40:16] eternalexalted: JDG monkaS
[4:40:19] FeelsTigletMan: GRF threw the finals more so than SKT leveling up IMO. the drafting was shoddy at best.
[4:40:23] eternalexalted: POGGERS
[4:40:25] jumanjigang: my £500 -1.5 bet won, ez £750 profit at odds of 2.5
[4:40:34] yanos33: Fanboy much LUL IG almost lost to KT last worlds, it couldve gone either way
[4:40:34] jumanjigang: ez money lets goo

[4:40:43] MonkeyDLuffy10911: Griefing LUL
[4:40:46] HystericsCasts: See you munchkins in the finals!
[4:40:50] fast_turtle15: @yanos33 ?
[4:40:51] nerska123: @yanos33 and last worls KT was AGES stronger than current SKT
[4:40:54] yanos33: and that was after a heavy meta shift in favor of IG
[4:40:54] ghaisd: U TAKE ME HIGHER WHEN I FEEL LOW
[4:40:56] Sandboxx74: who win??
[4:40:58] pogerhontas: !rewards
[4:41:02] HystericsCasts: FPX 3 - 1 TOP
[4:41:04] Boogielol: thanks for the broacast SeemsGood VoHiYo
[4:41:04] AyyItsMacie: See you guys at the finals! rooHi <3
[4:41:09] handonface: @TrantaLocked It really does feel like that. Maybe an off day. Maybe SKT just playing better? However my biggest single thing was those tower dives again and again bot. It just didnt make sense.
[4:41:17] AyyItsMacie: I ppredict a close 3-2 for IG
[4:41:17] Sandboxx74: @HystericsCasts Thx Bro
[4:41:23] AyyItsMacie: rooSip see you then rooLove
[4:41:24] HystericsCasts: <3
[4:41:24] Noveris: many of G2 picks are played by lpl as well, i think it's not a stretch to say that some of the players have watched lpl so maybe caps just followed jdg
[4:41:26] alexlipson: Can we all agree that Sylas is fucking broken right now? :/
[4:41:29] MonkeyDLuffy10911: LUL SKT IS MUCH STRONGER THAN KT LAST YEAR
[4:41:32] yanos33: @nerska123 How are you so sure about that?
[4:41:42] handonface: @TrantaLocked FanBTW but it was so off.
[4:41:45] o_verkiller: who won?
[4:42:06] alexlipson: Rito nerf sylas pls
[4:42:17] MonkeyDLuffy10911: IG 3-2 JDG
[4:42:24] nerska123: @yanos33 The only competition SKT had this year was GRF, GRF is a fucking top 4 team of last year
[4:42:35] nerska123: @yanos33 Same roster/no changes/same shit
[4:42:52] nerska123: @yanos33 And skt only managed to bet them in the very end
[4:42:56] ChappeyNineOne: who won
[4:42:59] yanos33: i mean yeah IG are favorites vs SKT sure, but SKT has a real chance
[4:43:03] nerska123: when they were fucking tilted and with drafts from iron 10
[4:43:05] 2sloweuw: PJSugar
[4:43:31] yanos33: and grf choked hard last year lol
[4:43:40] yanos33: they were the second best team in KR
[4:43:41] nerska123: LCK literally performed worse than EU last worlds
[4:43:42] handonface: If anyone in chat can tell me. Where would be the best place to hear from GRF about finals??? I really want to know why they did what they did both players andcvMAx
[4:43:50] FeelsTigletMan: khan and faker threw at times during playoffs. the bot lane and jungle were actually really stable
[4:43:52] nerska123: there's like no reason now for LCK'S hype
[4:44:10] kanz19: KR BOT LUL
[4:44:11] Noveris: eh
[4:44:12] kuhbauer95: @nerska123 they perfomed on na level
[4:44:20] 江边鸟_: who win?
[4:44:21] MonkeyDLuffy10911: KNIGHT 1v9 LUL
[4:44:51] handonface: The fact that people were saying Sword was the best player that series (when everyone says hes the worst player on the team. Wrong asf btw) Speaks volumes
[4:44:56] Mitsukoqt: people still quoting last years worlds to bash lck ? LuL
[4:45:06] nerska123: Tbh is expect China to SMASH KR at the rift rivals
[4:45:14] nerska123: the only competitive team LCK has is SKT
[4:45:19] JustFuzeIt: fpx3：1
[4:45:21] nerska123: everyone else is trash
[4:45:26] yanos33: KT was the second best team at worlds tho, idk how you are so sure KR did bad because their region has suddenly become trash instead of one year of under performance due to meta/other circumstances
[4:45:28] Noveris: why did my message not get sent wth
[4:45:32] MonkeyDLuffy10911: LUL
[4:45:36] Yolo_pete: Bye guys HeyGuys
[4:45:38] Mitsukoqt: @nerska123 do you even watch the league to say that ?
[4:45:38] kanz19: 21TH APR ResidentSleeper
[4:45:43] MonkeyDLuffy10911: TOP LUL
[4:45:47] nerska123: @Mitsukoqt I actually do
[4:45:49] handonface: At this point KR can finally be called the underdogs without reserve.
[4:46:03] nerska123: GRF/KZ would be mid-tier teams at best in LPL
[4:46:05] MonkeyDLuffy10911: THESHY VS THE ZOOM PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:46:08] TheCycleOfAshlesh: G2 will win MSI
[4:46:09] nerska123: and ofc not top2/3
[4:46:19] Noveris: said skt is strong, should be reasonable to favour them over g2 previous to direct confrontation, but CN team should be the 1st pick to win it all going into MSI
[4:46:32] Noveris: *prior, not previous
[4:46:35] wisdombro: @nerska123 I think worlds last year got more varied because of the elimination format
