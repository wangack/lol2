[0:21:23] BigPeePeeBeMyName: Yuumi is broken, but I don't think she's aggressive enough for LPL tbh. I Think we'll see much more of her in other regions

They haven't announced it, but it appears LNG signed some vet/talented players to their LDL team.

[4:38:40] Cruxxor: Honestly when you look at the 2019 iteration of TSM you see the complete package. They have the perfect balance of late game prowess with Zven and early mid game domination with Akaadian and BrokenBlade. Their teamfighting is so concise and decisive that you can lose the match at any moment. Bjergsen is back and honestly playing like the best player in the world.
