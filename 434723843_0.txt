[1:21:44] scottoflorida2014: I would think they understand some of the language
[1:21:58] scottoflorida2014: @CertainlySomeoneHere Yeah, maybe they have to grow on ya
[1:22:09] xiaogamer_: would love to hear them speak chinese
[1:22:10] scottoflorida2014: No room for hotheads I agree
[1:22:37] CertainlySomeoneHere: @scottofl2014 Mhm. But I suggest just having a talk with some as well, they're all really awesome and communicative people. If you have some kind of feedback, you can probably just let them know
[1:23:18] scottoflorida2014: @CertainlySomeoneHere Clement isnt bad. The one newer guy whos name escapes me is so monotone.
[1:23:50] scottoflorida2014: Raz elevated his game after his piece last year when he went to a park in China and had the ear cleaning thing lPogChamp
[1:24:02] EsportsTj: @scottofl2014 I work as a caster in other games. Chat always feels uncomfortable with new casters. Give it a few months and you will love them.
[1:24:16] EsportsTj: We casters call it Stockholm syndrome
[1:24:22] CertainlySomeoneHere: @scottofl2014 There's Raz, hysterics, Nibiria and Clement. You can see if you can just tweet at him and tell him that, but it really might just be it has to grow on you
[1:24:52] scottoflorida2014: Change isnt always a good thing :/
[1:25:02] CertainlySomeoneHere: @esportstj Yup. But admittingly, I love these casters cause I've talked to all of them and I can tell they're nice people certai1Hype

[1:25:53] EsportsTj: I only know nibiria personally but he is a very nice boy
[1:26:11] scottoflorida2014: Being a nice person doesnt make one a good caster
[1:26:18] CertainlySomeoneHere: @esportstj I haven't met him IRL, but I talk to him on twitch a lot.
[1:26:32] CertainlySomeoneHere: @scottofl2014 True! But by talking to him I know he's doing his best to improve his casting

[1:27:33] EsportsTj: I do think there is a relationship though, the casters that are hard to work with tend to struggle. So much of casting is communication with your partners and production staff.
