[1:17:08] edgelordweeb: @n1ckst4r02 apparently he's back to being good, his last couple series he's popped off
[1:17:11] sqradi: knight cam mid Pog
[1:17:25] edgelordweeb: SofM on peak form would easily be top 5 LCK
[1:17:45] xqf052: ???
[1:17:48] edgelordweeb: LPL idk
[1:17:58] edgelordweeb: He can reach that level

[1:18:21] phytrix7: SofM should be good, strong showing so far

[1:18:23] GummiGrim: @n1ckst4r02 Yeah, his nerfs won't come till next patch
[1:18:26] CertainlySomeoneHere: Not sure elaaDerp not too familiar with all the junglers, LPL has quite some good ones
[1:18:34] djjohnnymelster: spring 2018 sofm was mvp candidate
[1:18:37] flamazide: i liked TOP more as well
[1:18:39] keebao: Lpl junglers are generally feast or famine. so it's kinda easy to be a top jungler in LPL depending on day
[1:18:41] phytrix7: Tian is looking very strong
[1:18:43] unclearhate: why is The Elder Scrolls here?
[1:18:59] New_Try: putting sylas into cam NotLikeThis

[1:19:52] GummiGrim: @n1ckst4r02 Rumble
[1:20:03] phytrix7: Curse is looking like a top 3 top laner too atm, hopefully Penguin can keep up
[1:20:17] edgelordweeb: Curse has played one series
[1:20:19] Vens5: RNG WAITING ROOM ResidentSleeper

[1:20:35] yatildesnomesutilisable: silver you so
[1:20:43] NocturnVenomKRYP: I don't like rumble
[1:20:49] edgelordweeb: Rumble is mostly used in pro play
[1:20:55] edgelordweeb: Not that common in soloq
[1:20:55] GummiGrim: @n1ckst4r02 Rumble use to be a popular top pick, but yeah he hasn't been meta for a while
[1:20:59] CertainlySomeoneHere: @n1ckst4r02 he shreds health but he's not that great overall? Some call him a lane bully
[1:21:01] GummiGrim: He's seeing more play now though
[1:21:01] edgelordweeb: Kind of a weird champ
[1:21:03] phytrix7: Curse was considered a threat even when he was underage, just off scrims and word of mouth
[1:21:09] pepega_kkona_chan_ayaya: @n1ckst4r02 more so like a juggernaut mage in a way
[1:21:13] NocturnVenomKRYP: Kenen Irelia jayce I think is better
[1:21:17] GummiGrim: @n1ckst4r02 He's a lane bully with a great midgame
[1:21:29] GummiGrim: @n1ckst4r02 Think kind of like Jayce or Kennen I guess

[1:23:05] New_Try: good matchup vs sylas and cam+sej one of the best 2v2s
[1:23:05] marcinyob: hi
[1:23:10] GummiGrim: @NocturnVenom Also synergies with Sejuani well
[1:23:18] phytrix7: And yeah the cam sej combo is heavy
[1:23:28] NocturnVenomKRYP: I like that
[1:23:30] keebao: @n1ckst4r02 its splyce LUL gate keeping 6th place since always
[1:23:30] phytrix7: wouldn't doubt it
[1:24:07] phytrix7: Star power, yes. Talent, eh. regionally sure
[1:24:10] GummiGrim: @n1ckst4r02 I mean they had to earn it, star power does not always equate success
[1:24:11] pepega_kkona_chan_ayaya: @n1ckst4r02 hopefully the 'eyes on' curse doesn't screw them over tho

[1:25:49] phytrix7: ^^^
[1:25:53] cope_enjoyer: didn't know rumble took conqueror now, that's kinda cool :O
[1:26:05] thiaguinxz: CADE O POV DO KNIGHT PORRA
[1:26:10] elliottjp: IDK about that, G2 beat RNG in solo lane meta and they are way better players now compared to semi finals

[1:27:27] 피닉스뱍1: caps>rookie

[1:27:50] i48763: EU>NA Kappa
[1:28:01] cope_enjoyer: @GummiGrim yea idk how he's gonna stack vs vlad too but in teamfights it should be better..?
[1:28:01] sqradi: ming no way? OMEGALUL
[1:28:03] edgelordweeb: Ming has been the best support in the world for like 2 and a half years now
[1:28:09] phytrix7: Ming is the best support in the LPL right now
[1:28:13] edgelordweeb: Wtf are you talking about
[1:28:23] Linko98: LMAO
[1:28:23] Clement_LoL: Ming engages are lit

[1:28:27] yatildesnomesutilisable: knight >>caps
[1:28:27] Optyfenx: @n1ckst4r02 dunno if trolling or not but its not funny so I assume you are serious
[1:28:28] edgelordweeb: Ming is a huge playmaker and the best player on RNG
[1:28:31] fast_turtle15: Ming is pretty flawless
[1:28:36] sqradi: what is this 2017 rng narrative
[1:28:36] GummiGrim: @bwns Since Rumble is melee, he gets the longer duration for stacks, so he's able to take his time and use E and such to slowly get it
[1:28:37] 7plt22: Ming and Mikyx two best supports in the world
[1:28:40] phytrix7: And Ming was the top LPL support even without Uzi...
[1:29:03] NocturnVenomKRYP: ignite??
[1:29:05] Clement_LoL: gotta say Ben is really impressive with this morg
[1:29:12] phytrix7: Did you see his 80% winrate alistair last split?
[1:29:16] Clement_LoL: black shield always on point
[1:29:26] CertainlySomeoneHere: @clement_lol I agree
[1:29:33] NocturnVenomKRYP: that ward??
[1:29:43] phytrix7: Best player in the LPL, Doinb?

[1:30:06] Linko98: doinb dark magic yes
[1:30:07] cope_enjoyer: @GummiGrim well i guess it kinda makes sense then.. SeemsGood
[1:30:18] phytrix7: Agreed knight>rookie
[1:30:18] Clement_LoL: @phytrix7 in regular split yes, but I still need to see doinb work in post season
[1:30:18] NocturnVenomKRYP: Doinb or LWX
[1:30:26] sqradi: he might be. he makes every team he is in look suddenly top tier
[1:30:53] phytrix7: Entitled to your opinion.
[1:30:54] edgelordweeb: That's more because of Doinb's shotcalling and leadership abilities
[1:30:58] phytrix7: @Clement_LoL Yeah agreed
[1:30:59] edgelordweeb: He is one of the best mids though
[1:31:08] yatildesnomesutilisable: pls, silver players who don't even know rumble should go playing more games, instead of judging the pros
[1:31:18] 7plt22: caps and wunder are insane

[1:32:20] 7plt22: @goblibguy01 and G2 0-2 vs PVB. And?
[1:32:24] goblinguy01: Worlds
[1:32:26] phytrix7: Cmon VG get first blood so I can get my sportsbet payout, then lose the series. thx
[1:32:46] cope_enjoyer: not really since you are talking about which team could beat g2
[1:32:48] goblinguy01: G2 would lose to Jin Air Kappa
[1:32:55] Optyfenx: you are holding pointless discussions with yourself like im helping you with saying you should stop
[1:33:04] frakteon95: and your IG lost against TL omegaLUL
[1:33:32] Clement_LoL: TES walking away with this early game, needed bot lane kills to work for VG, they don't have a good target for cata/equalizer
[1:33:47] yatildesnomesutilisable: there's no use for silver to watch a pro game, go practice more ur farming
[1:33:49] kutoriiii: 0kills ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:33:53] phytrix7: VG not showing any weak spots just yet, kind of surprised
[1:34:00] unique_mode: i had to leave lck cause of LS
[1:34:19] goblinguy01: LS, quit BBQ to stream DansGame
[1:34:19] Beetrayn: Ahhhtrox
[1:34:41] goblinguy01: TES = Top Esports. Different acronym
[1:34:43] phytrix7: Cheers VG, $10 @3.00 for first drag
[1:34:44] DaSlushy: I think TES is TOP... Just different abbreviations
[1:34:49] phytrix7: Now get first kill
[1:34:52] verra_: And no one knows the actual best team. There is no clear xtrem dominant on every game team.
[1:35:20] goblinguy01: SKT looked bad against Jin Air, they got gifted game 1
[1:35:26] xqf052: IG may not go to world this year based on their recent performnce. But when lpl and lck send top 3 teams, there is no chance na and eu teams can win world :)
[1:35:28] Clement_LoL: @phytrix7 for me they havne't shown they can push leads where they need to control early tempo, they won't ourright lose, but they will bleed out frequently
[1:35:40] DeadZeph: Why is Camille mid lane all of a sudden a thing this week?
[1:35:43] nekitamocika: LUL Ken
[1:35:48] Clement_LoL: lol caster curse
[1:35:51] Sov25: @goblibguy01 They looked bad besides game 3 but IG tho. IG looks boosted when the meta doesn't favor them.
[1:36:04] homeless_aki: loken LUL
[1:36:06] yatildesnomesutilisable: top e-sports - - - - - - TES
[1:36:13] Peterandvanny628: why no replay of the kill LUL
[1:36:17] phytrix7: @Clement_LoL Yeah I expect to see that when vlad gets 2 items
[1:36:23] goblinguy01: VG has so much potential, please don't troll and derp

[1:37:20] PoliticalMuffin: Is Swift still playing? I remember getting hyped when he joined vici.
[1:37:21] marcose1: Kreygasm
[1:37:26] phytrix7: she's a great champ for the meta, into sylas and with sej
[1:37:26] Sov25: @goblibguy01 Still garbage jungler tho
[1:37:41] GummiGrim: She got a lot of nerfs from Jg Cam though
[1:37:47] Sov25: @goblibguy01 Much worse jungler actually since the scuttle change comes later which mean camille clearing is way worse.
[1:37:48] himself4396: BloodTrail BloodTrail
[1:37:55] Clement_LoL: @n1ckst4r02 yes, she's a tier two flex and comps that can do picks are in meta
[1:38:08] fenkfetishes: Why is invoker a vampire here?
[1:38:12] Sov25: @n1ckst4r02 She is good when picked with sejuani. Def not a go to pick for every scenario
[1:38:19] Clement_LoL: @n1ckst4r02 lots of tools to make hers strong, sivir olaf sej
[1:38:35] liquid_spac3: What happened with herald?
[1:38:44] phytrix7: Ok, now that I've got my first blood and first drag payout you can shit on VG now :p
[1:38:46] CertainlySomeoneHere: @liquid_spac3 sent mid
[1:38:47] GummiGrim: @liquid_spac3 What do you mean?
[1:38:50] Clement_LoL: @liquid_spac3 used top lane
[1:39:09] CertainlySomeoneHere: I thought it was used mid? I must be sleepy
[1:39:22] Clement_LoL: @CertainlySomeoneHere nah you are right actually
[1:39:29] Clement_LoL: my bad TES got it
[1:39:34] phytrix7: Interesting to see that rift is being used for plating and not prioritised for an actual turret nowadays

[1:42:45] tr1ption: @Clement_LoL ok, I was confused since I really cant trasnlate chinese :D thank you
[1:42:53] Sov25: @shiny_chocobo I mean TL spanked IG that they are now a boosted team who relies on the meta carrying them
[1:43:12] phytrix7: Ok vlad with 2 items and pen boots, this next 5v5 will be interesting
[1:43:19] Clement_LoL: @tr1ption yeah we should try to get it bilingual tbh
[1:43:24] shiny_chocobo: @Sov25 I didn't say anything about that tho
[1:43:41] lunarwolffff: How did Loken fall behind with Caitlyn Morgana
[1:43:41] PreacherCasts: Bilingual stream Kreygasm
[1:43:42] tr1ption: @Clement_LoL yeah that would be rly helpful
[1:43:49] washer_19: yeah a lot of this rests on if puff/southwind can continue to snowball
[1:44:20] CertainlySomeoneHere: English PoV streams? would be awesome
[1:45:06] washer_19: when lpl gets lck numbers maybe we'll get them
[1:45:07] Sov25: @shiny_chocobo Just had to make sure your eyes were working after that MSI massacre from TL on IG
[1:45:11] lunarwolffff: Knight is a one man army

[1:47:16] Sov25: @lunarwolffff Now that people abuse ning it's freelo to gank top
[1:47:24] phytrix7: Jackeylove straight up threw their 2nd(?) game, walking straight into their team as sivir when they were making a comeback
[1:47:35] Sov25: @tr1ption Jackeylove was a huge reason they lost at MSI
[1:47:37] ScuffedSaiyan: Vlad late game op

[1:49:01] lunarwolffff: Just Chalizi being bad
[1:49:02] Clement_LoL: that was actually still worth for VG, wouldn't call it suicide

[1:51:23] pepega_kkona_chan_ayaya: @phytrix7 oh tru tru mb
[1:51:28] Clement_LoL: @KR_WORST_REGION that is so hype, want to see him vs. Chovy, they're rivals
[1:51:32] xqf052: interma of mechanic skills. knight is the best in lpl.
[1:51:36] shiny_chocobo: Can't wait for Knight to nut all over Faker LUL
[1:52:00] sqradi: doinb and knight taking turns nutting on faker LUL
[1:52:03] Sov25: @xqf052 Nah in playoffs he disappeared more than demarcus cousin in the finals
[1:52:33] phytrix7: Can't just consider mechanics, gotta consider the whole package. There's a reason why Doinb teams revolve around him and win, that comes down to shotcalling, strategy, proven ability to win games
[1:52:40] Clement_LoL: @Sov25 I agree with this, I think Knight still has a ton of solo q in him, doesn't take proactive risks when behind
[1:52:49] washer_19: yeah knight can go off on ian all he wants but in order to make a legacy you have to go off on rookie and the others
[1:52:55] washer_19: that said his mechanics are insane
[1:53:17] crys_araujo: Loken LUL
[1:53:22] phytrix7: If only vlad was there at the start of the fight

[1:53:43] Optyfenx: @Clement_LoL opinion about puff? imo he played really well last match and this match as well

[2:00:32] AnimeFdc: the elder scrolls really good team Kappa
[2:00:32] phytrix7: That was an LPL game, who was it again?
[2:00:37] edgelordweeb: Loken was more than average last year
[2:00:53] edgelordweeb: Loken still has good positioning in teamfights
[2:00:59] sevenyam: doinB smashed on renek
[2:01:11] phytrix7: @edgelordweeb Idk I saw him in 2 seperate teamfights out of position, his fight in botlane where everyone but knight died he didn't need to lose half his health

[2:04:54] phytrix7: Someone earlier said iG are having internal issues, can't personally comment nor confirm
[2:04:55] the_woo_titan: they cant be that good if tl beat them
[2:05:23] krazy2xtreme: I'm hoping RNG wins Worlds. UZI deserves onw

[2:06:01] phytrix7: @Dethrey They are casting, just not this top plays
[2:06:27] CertainlySomeoneHere: @HugoHalfman There can be plenty of raesons outside of in game skill for a team to lose
[2:06:30] Clement_LoL: @tsmfansaredelusional I'm actually not that worried about IG, pretty normal to see teams that went to MSI bomb out till Rift Rivals
[2:06:32] nekitamocika: LUL CAS
[2:06:33] Dethrey: @phytrix7 oh cool cool
[2:06:33] Soen: IG LUL
[2:06:44] tsmfansaredelusional: @KR_WORST_REGION it was there mechanics that cost them...TheShy getting smashed in a matchup he wins, or Rookie running it down on Naut like WUT
[2:07:00] Clement_LoL: SKT don't look that good coming back to the new split, they're jumping two patches into the future with very little breaks
[2:07:11] PreacherCasts: Feels good man
[2:07:14] yangyangfebruary: RNG No1
[2:07:14] xqf052: IG let LNG have atrox in both the two games....

[2:07:50] Soen: The MSI teams need some adjustment time IMO
[2:07:58] IchiAndJela: 's why okayyyyyyyyyyy chill guys
[2:08:00] Clement_LoL: @Iscaf3 yeah it usually takes a while for MSI teams to be in form, patch difference is large
[2:08:03] 香港奶臭西: SKT No.1 TakeNRG
[2:08:05] banned_for_trihard2: G2 looked a sstrong as ever tho
[2:08:31] tsmfansaredelusional: @Clement_LoL do u have IG winning summer? RNG or FPX seem way more likely
[2:08:39] 삼도천심해어: LNG > IG OMEGALUL
[2:08:43] xqf052: Feel like IG probably wont go to world this year
[2:08:46] Soen: @banned_for_trihard2 We have to see in the upcoming weeks they might lose atleast 1 game or LEC is just bad LUL
[2:08:50] Clement_LoL: @banned_for_trihard2 I'd say the difference between G2 and the rest of LEC is far larger than IG SKT, LPL/LCK
[2:09:32] CertainlySomeoneHere: 8/1/8 elaaDerp
[2:09:35] banned_for_trihard2: its probably true, but still. no silly mistakes, no signs of lost focus etc
[2:10:12] velocegravity: IG didnt lose anything in LPL aswell some time ago...
[2:10:57] Clement_LoL: @tsmfansaredelusional it will be between IG or RNG
[2:11:08] phytrix7: VG went too deep, they cant capitalise on a play like that without any health left on half your team
[2:11:13] banned_for_trihard2: how RNG looked in their game?
[2:11:32] Clement_LoL: Rookie historically has Doinb's number and Uzi had lwx's, too hard for FPX, so it is between those two
[2:11:39] 1kenn1: wtf is TES?
[2:11:48] banned_for_trihard2: the elder scrolls
[2:11:48] jgr1231: knight =vg
[2:11:52] PreacherCasts: @1kenn1 TOP Esports
[2:12:09] xqf052: At least RNG has a more reliable top laner now,
[2:12:21] furbar82: I actually can see IG really struggle this split. Since worlds semis everthing was working for them till the TL game. So for a young team who were kind of choking before i can see them fall apart.
[2:12:47] phytrix7: I can see RNG settling down at 5th place
[2:12:48] CertainlySomeoneHere: @furbar82 it's gonna depend on their mentality
[2:13:18] kma03: krepo?
[2:13:18] PreacherCasts: They had a good explanation for why they lost against TL: because they didn't respect the matchup. It's stupid to lose that way, but it does fit exactly who iG are
[2:13:21] phytrix7: Sej ban yes.
[2:13:25] tsmfansaredelusional: they just need to sub DUKE in, and for Rookie to stop inting, Ning hopefully he gets over his girlfriend, and they can win
[2:13:35] furbar82: @CertainlySomeoneHere Yeah maybe the come back soon even more scary but I think these players dont have the strongest mentality.
[2:13:47] Clement_LoL: @phytrix7 hard for me to see that, they were 4th without playing Uzi most of Spring. they're top 3 for me
[2:14:00] CertainlySomeoneHere: @furbar82 we will have to see
[2:14:08] vicviper: IG needs to get Lukas working or Baolan back
[2:14:11] CertainlySomeoneHere: I think the reason they lost to TL was mentality anyways
[2:14:19] Sov25: @PreacherCasts Nah ning/jackeylove got exposed bad
[2:14:23] btasty: their jersey sleeves are way too short
[2:14:42] Clement_LoL: @btasty oh god you're right, cannot unsee now
[2:14:48] tsmfansaredelusional: lukas didnt look bad, it wasnt his fault the rest of the team started collapsing
[2:15:00] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Clement_LoL I didn't see LUL should I be happy
[2:15:14] Clement_LoL: @CertainlySomeoneHere you are blessed, don't think about it
[2:15:16] furbar82: @CertainlySomeoneHere For sure! I expected them to come into LPL destroying opponents, to show it was just one series. But them even subbing out bolean leaves me worrying
[2:15:18] banned_for_trihard2: they also dont wear underwear
[2:15:26] PreacherCasts: So far, JackeyLove's overperforming. I'm unconvinced this is the utter capitulation of iG until playoffs
[2:15:29] btasty: at least you can appreciate well fitting jerseys now @Clement_LoL
[2:15:31] phytrix7: Will have to see how strong Royal looks next game, I'm not sold but
[2:15:57] CertainlySomeoneHere: @furbar82 hmm. well, we will see right? certai1Lurk let's hope they get over it and manage to keep strong
[2:15:59] phytrix7: So hyped to see this RW team
[2:16:06] weeaboolol: LUL this is the region that lost to NA?
[2:16:07] Audorable_: loooooooooooool
[2:16:10] hamburgchoi: Ning looks bad
[2:16:11] vicviper: Lukas doesn't roam like Baolan but IG really needs that for their playstyle
[2:16:30] weeaboolol: TSM > IG
[2:16:40] weeaboolol: tsm 2-3 TL and IG 1-3 TL.
[2:16:53] luccid: sleep or watch this match? macaiy1Mmk
[2:17:08] Sov25: @KR_WORST_REGION Hopefully not. When he's not on rakan or champs that don't require using your brain, he's awful.
[2:17:09] CertainlySomeoneHere: @luccid sleep. I can update you on the match later
[2:17:11] sqradi: it doesnt look like baolan wants to stay in ig but who knows the guy is always saying he wants to leave ig but ends up staying LUL
[2:17:13] Clement_LoL: @KR_WORST_REGION I hope so, it was weird he wanted to leave after winning worlds, suggests considerations outside of gameplay
[2:17:24] luccid: @CertainlySomeoneHere okay thanks :)
[2:17:27] phytrix7: Ban the sej VG... there's a reason most teams are doing it
[2:17:41] jgr1231: SeemsGood
[2:17:49] shiny_chocobo: Ty raz LUL
[2:17:55] Clement_LoL: lol Auto mod still caught you @tsmfansaredelusional
[2:18:01] 1kenn1: why did they change to TES
[2:18:02] tsmfansaredelusional: nooo
[2:18:05] Clairfoyance: imo Rookie has been heavy weight for IG, he is nowhere near to his last years form when he was mvp material
[2:18:08] 1kenn1: TOP is better
[2:18:10] eScryD: didn't boalan play as MSI? is he not on IG anymore?
[2:18:13] phytrix7: LOL
[2:18:14] 橋科工程師: @clement_lol

[2:19:01] tsmfansaredelusional: @Lofi_Chill
[2:19:11] 1121232132131321: @btasty impossible to know until we see numbers and gampleay
[2:19:14] phytrix7: Can gian play renek?
[2:19:23] tsmfansaredelusional: @Lofi_Chill rookie is still top 5 mid in the world, why would they replace him
[2:19:35] individuum: is sylas disabled for lpl?
[2:19:35] mandamcgee: does anyone know who was favoured for hanwha vs kt on betting sites?
[2:19:36] btasty: @1121232132131321 yea true, i feel like its going to be insanely hard to balance
[2:19:38] Clairfoyance: @StrangeL00ps only natural that next mid to rise up is NA then Kappa
[2:19:41] Clement_LoL: @btasty for me assassins are capped by their invulnerability, if her stealth is long enough she'll be great
[2:19:45] phytrix7: @individuum Nope
[2:19:46] fast_turtle15: no sylas is available
[2:19:48] weeaboolol: @tsmfansaredelusional ? bjerg played better than rookie against TL lol
[2:19:50] Audorable_: @btasty broken like sylas, pick or ban in every game lol
[2:19:53] Clairfoyance: @tsmfansaredelusional top 5? doubt LUL

[2:20:15] btasty: @Clement_LoL @aCrookedWorld going to be interesting
[2:20:18] weeaboolol: @tsmfansaredelusional Caps , Jensen , Bjerg , Nisqy , Pob. how is rookie top 5?
[2:20:22] phytrix7: @mandamcgee 2.20 kt
[2:20:39] tsmfansaredelusional: @weeaboolol shut up LUL
[2:20:54] vicviper: LUL
[2:20:54] Sov25: @weeaboolol Good thing Rookie has played well consistently so he doesn't need a poor MSI playoffs to drag his legacy down unlike bjergsen the "western faker" the best "mid in the world" LUL
[2:21:00] mandamcgee: @phytrix7 sorry idk anything about decimal odds, what is 2.20? is that negative odds in american?
[2:21:01] 1kenn1: TSM Zven LUL
[2:21:04] individuum: @weeaboolol u have to be trolling
[2:21:10] weeaboolol: Bjerg best mid .
[2:21:16] celailinda: BlessRNG vici pls do better this split
[2:21:21] shiny_chocobo: Bjerg best mid west LUL
[2:21:27] tsmfansaredelusional: @Lofi_Chill Caps Faker Doinb Knight Rookie, 100% these are top 5
[2:21:30] weeaboolol: @shiny_chocobo Best mid worlds.
[2:21:32] CertainlySomeoneHere: YESS

[2:22:08] Clairfoyance: @tsmfansaredelusional dont agree with rookie, if u change his name from anything, this player would even be in top 10 LUL
[2:22:08] 1kenn1: Choky > Faker LUL

[2:22:28] weeaboolol: @Lofi_Chill ofcourse , bjerg is better
[2:22:31] tsmfansaredelusional: imagine thinking caps not top 5 or chovy > faker LUL
[2:22:31] fast_turtle15: tahm nerf
[2:22:33] Clement_LoL: Sona Taric are free to scale, VG need renekton to go bottom to stop this
[2:22:44] 1kenn1: no one plays Tahm in lpl
[2:22:44] weeaboolol: @tsmfansaredelusional chovy > faker tho tbh lol
[2:22:52] eScryD: they legit just trying to outscale in teamfights with sona taric
[2:22:55] Sov25: @aCrookedWorld Sona/Taric better synergy. Tahm works as a bandaid if they take taric since he can counter taric in lane
[2:22:56] weeaboolol: @tsmfansaredelusional in fact , pawn > faker the whole spring split xd
[2:22:57] furbar82: @thiaguinxz In playoffs and important matches Faker >>> Chovy Griffin actually have to show up at a bo5 or they cant be considered a good team/players
[2:23:01] phytrix7: @weeaboolol doinb, knight, caps, faker, rookie, chovy, in no particular order, there are the 6 top mids
[2:23:06] MagikLimbo: ca
[2:23:06] Clement_LoL: If Xx gets a gank on Renekton early this game is over for VG
[2:23:12] weeaboolol: @phytrix7 agree
[2:23:12] thiaguinxz: @furbar82 true

[2:23:25] Audorable_: @Sov25 tahm is op lol
[2:23:28] lovenishimiya: is LPL the best region currently?

[2:23:31] WinterStorme: TriHard Clap TriHard Clap TriHard Clap
[2:23:41] eScryD: @phytrix7 don't forget Perkz Kappa
[2:23:41] Sov25: @aCrookedWorld As a top laner in soloq yes. As a support, not really.
[2:23:42] Bobthepi: @lovenishimiya yep
[2:23:46] Clement_LoL: @lovenishimiya I believe it is for overall strength
[2:23:52] bloodrain121314: LPL lost against NA lul
[2:23:58] Clairfoyance: players like nukeduck are heavily underrated, i think he can be better than rookie, knight, chovy LUL
[2:23:59] weeaboolol: @furbar82 according to your logic , pawn > faker right?
[2:24:00] tsmfansaredelusional: @phytrix7 chovy has been inting since finals, Ucal looked better
[2:24:10] weeaboolol: @furbar82 faker hard inted against KZ and teddy carried him

[2:24:33] phytrix7: @tsmfansaredelusional Don't think that's basis to disregard his entire performance last split
[2:24:35] weeaboolol: @ScuffedSaiyan actually true. LPL and LCk are wildcard region
[2:24:36] furbar82: @weeaboolol Why should he? o0
[2:24:37] Clairfoyance: @acrappywizard clear bias, u clearly dont watch LEC LUL
[2:24:46] 1kenn1: LCK is garbage LUL
[2:24:49] Kristianyy: @sulojen loken
[2:24:50] weeaboolol: @furbar82 because pawn played better than faker in that series
[2:25:07] xqf052: EU>NA>lck=lpl But in the world, lck and lpl will come back.
[2:25:23] acrappywizard: @lofi_chill its my most watched league since im european. hes very good and underrated but better than chovy? i dont think so sadly
[2:25:25] weeaboolol: @furbar82 you argument was that in playoff , who plays better is a metric on how good a player is. Faker played super badly against kz
[2:25:29] MagikLimbo: watching ResidentSleeper LUL FailFish Ezreal in lpl watching countdown timer for DWG vs Griffin PogChamp
[2:25:32] furbar82: @weeaboolol So faker inted one series? So what? Griffin losing multiple important bo5 so far.
[2:25:32] WinterStorme: thinking that the LCK is relevant LUL
[2:25:32] 0attackjewel: @Lofi_Chill hes good but not that good
[2:25:36] phytrix7: Hopefully gian can pull off this renekton mid, we saw how huge doinb was on it
[2:25:41] weeaboolol: @furbar82 chovy inted 1 series
[2:25:44] 1kenn1: LCK should get 1 worlds slot
[2:25:51] 1kenn1: wildcard region only deserve 1
[2:25:51] eScryD: Only good LCK teams are GRF SKT SB
[2:25:57] Clairfoyance: @acrappywizard chovy? cmon LUL he was literally akali/zoe 2 trick
[2:25:58] weeaboolol: @furbar82 why are you judging chovy by how well his team does?
[2:25:58] Bobthepi: @xqf052 thats just cause na and eu have one or two strong teams. In terms of overall league lpl is best
[2:26:04] sqradi: @phytrix7 his name is actually Ian not gian LUL
[2:26:07] weeaboolol: @furbar82 if that's the case , untara was the 2nd best top in 2017?
