[3:22:14] fusiion18: 1maps win?
[3:22:23] fusiion18: edg?
[3:22:34] 우헷하헷: in the bench
[3:22:34] phytrix7: The lanes aren't that bad. They aren't winning lanes but they won't get stomoed... Such negative casters
[3:22:44] Lorenzette: JDG LUL
[3:22:47] MelonFortress: edg win in 18 minutes LUL
[3:23:12] 우헷하헷: jdg what the kanavi? where is flawless?
[3:23:30] phytrix7: Casters are so wrong. JDG has plenty of winability
[3:23:44] phytrix7: They need to be less bias and more analytical
[3:23:58] sqradi: are you sure you're not being bias for jdg LUL
[3:24:04] AngieFoxtrot: See, now I want JDG win this just to prove them wrong
[3:24:06] phytrix7: I'm rooting for EDG.
[3:24:08] m00nrabbits: what is the bias?
[3:24:19] m00nrabbits: they think edg has the better draft so they said so
[3:24:27] 3323ssss: TY KFC
[3:24:39] Drekt: Gotta be a fan of this sick bot lane.
[3:25:03] phytrix7: I'm just saying, coming into a game saying "theres no way for team x to win except y" is a bad attitude as a caster. Should be saying "i like this about team A, worried about this for team B, curious to see how they respond to X"
[3:25:22] zenror: wtf where is NAs Boy Ray???
[3:25:46] widepeepoHappy_Clap: @phytrix7 they're not wrong lol, jdg drafted with brain off
[3:25:56] MelonFortress: that makes sense if it's a slight advantage but it's not just a slight advantage
[3:26:26] chunkit1922: O_____O

[3:26:33] chitnyi1993: just watch and u will know LUL
[3:26:54] tr1ption: Lee forced flash "wp Neeko you land snare" :DD
[3:27:40] tobyzzzlpl: I mean EDG is an early game focus team right now. Gave Zoom GP might not be a good pick. GP can't do shit if other teams can't hold up their own lane in ther early game
[3:27:44] coltluger: zoom????
[3:27:45] sqradi: Pog
[3:27:47] tobyzzzlpl: Here we go
[3:27:52] 3StripesLTU: LETS GOOOO
[3:27:53] phytrix7: SKT favours Lee, they have a top tier laner in sylas and a top tier teamfighter in naut, GP has looked good in Korea, and there's a fair bit of synergy with the comp.
[3:27:57] Rudiko: @tr1ption yes scout would be dead without the snare
[3:28:02] sqradi: glad JDG is finally using kanavi at least
[3:28:25] AngieFoxtrot: To be clear, I'm cheering for EDG, but declaring which team is going to like that, just makes me instinctively what the other team to prove them wrong
[3:28:31] Sh1ionx: 20 cs up as gp vs aatrox not great in lane btw LUL
[3:28:36] widepeepoHappy_Clap: @phytrix7 the same skt that lost to JAG? lol
[3:28:53] white_wu: PogChamp
[3:28:54] tr1ption: @Rudiko he hit that double snarew bcs he flashed, it was well played by lee definitely not neeko...
[3:29:09] phytrix7: Oh no they lost 1 series, guess they're no longer a multi-time world champ and consistent top tier team for 5 years
[3:29:29] widepeepoHappy_Clap: winning season 3 worlds means their good in 2019 nice one A
[3:29:55] AngieFoxtrot: I have no idea why I get like that, must just have a soft spot for underdogs

[3:38:54] Linko98: if knight doesnt carry they are not top 4 in LPL
[3:39:18] phytrix7: His team is getting better at playing around him, just like Doinb's team does around him

[3:57:03] vicviper: ming?
[3:57:09] adroit5927: imagine if RNG had knight PogChamp
[3:57:11] m00nrabbits: probably ming

[3:57:20] brandoniannn: knight/chovy probably some of the most mechanically insane players ever
[3:57:20] will_o_will: RNG shortcaller is Perkz
[3:57:23] phrenetico: please 2 games or 3 games?
[3:57:25] phytrix7: I bet Uzi has a lot of input regardless of the shotcaller though
[3:57:39] edwinzs: @hystericscasts Do you have any idea of why it's happening?

[3:58:11] oolloozzxx: LCK LPL waiting ResidentSleeper
[3:58:15] brandoniannn: "kill him kill him kill him auajwbeifjbeneiejcirjie!!!!!"
[3:58:21] phytrix7: RNG with knight would be a top 2 team
[3:58:27] phytrix7: With ease
[3:58:32] brandoniannn: xiaohu is still very good
[3:58:35] AverageUgandan: !playlist
[3:58:35] Aradove: was game 1 stomp?
[3:58:37] brandoniannn: and looks quite in form atm
[3:58:42] edwinzs: @phytrix7 Maybe, I think xiaohu have a good act at this too, in many interviews they (RNG players) quote some of xiaohu calls
[3:58:44] m00nrabbits: xiaohu can be good*
[3:58:47] AverageUgandan: !PLAYLIST
[3:58:48] brandoniannn: xiaohu good at more utility mids as well
[3:58:57] xyanade: xiaohu is doing better this split tho
[3:58:58] brandoniannn: he's been crushing so far this season
[3:59:00] phytrix7: Yeah Xiaohu isn't bad
[3:59:03] vicviper: Kappa xiaohu1 with glasses is good
[3:59:14] m00nrabbits: well this season just started they've yet to play the top teams
[3:59:21] adroit5927: if RNG wants to win worlds they should really try to get knight
[3:59:27] brandoniannn: xiaohu lowkey one of the best sylas players ive seen
[3:59:28] phytrix7: But is he a top 3 mid for a top 3 team? Idk
[3:59:37] phytrix7: @adroit5927 Good luck lol

[3:59:52] mazezhong1994: Lpl suck
[3:59:57] Cayldar: no but i wish i was @alrealre
[3:59:59] sqradi: yeah true im still not 100% sure about rng until they play the top teams
[4:00:00] STONEFREE__: I think RNG can let the carry work to langx and Uzi and let xiaohu do his sup mid job LUL LUL
[4:00:13] sqradi: but they look better than spring for sure
[4:00:18] will_o_will: ning with girl friend good 2
[4:00:22] adroit5927: i dont think xiaohu can win reliably against mids like faker, rookie or caps

[4:00:38] xyanade: yeah ppl would rather watch ezreal poke 50k damage than watching some decent lpl team fights, sad

[4:00:48] feitaaaaaN: does he play 2nd game?
[4:00:49] brandoniannn: rookie/caps/knight/chovy by far best mids atm
[4:01:13] vicviper: LUL some Twitch bois still don't understand majority of LPL audiences are watching on Huya
[4:01:15] adroit5927: knight's champion pool is insane
[4:01:24] phytrix7: Doinb>Chovy>Knight9>Faker>Caps>Rookie
[4:01:26] xyanade: chovy got smashed by faker spring split tho
[4:01:31] brandoniannn: AHHH YES DOINB TOO
[4:01:37] brandoniannn: doinb is an absolute unit
[4:01:42] m00nrabbits: chovy mvp pog
[4:01:50] brandoniannn: chovy smashed faker entire split
[4:01:55] phytrix7: I think Doinb is the best competitive player in the world, in any role
[4:01:56] brandoniannn: up until finals
[4:01:57] edwinzs: Xiaohu isn't bad, but he has a clear limit that Knight does not

[4:02:08] adroit5927: chovy is overrated LUL

[4:02:17] xyanade: doesn't matter, in the most crucial match he did nothing
[4:02:18] TheFlofper: China has 40 bilion people and only 2K views LUL
[4:02:22] fusiion18: 2-0?
[4:02:25] shiny_chocobo: Clement turned on Kreygasm
[4:02:32] tobyzzzlpl: :D
[4:03:01] brandoniannn: there is a reason knight still considers chovy one of the best mids in the world currently
[4:03:02] sugarloww: Clement is really developing into a great caster/analyst <3 <3 <3
[4:03:03] m00nrabbits: wait they summed them out...

[4:04:23] quem_ehh_john_galt: Brasil br
[4:04:26] brandoniannn: just inconsistent players

[4:05:38] quem_ehh_john_galt: Flamengo frontal Br Will win the worlds
[4:05:44] storegitte: @mrpinkxxxxx SKT is losing to Afreeca right now and they basically lost 2-0 to Jin Air 3 days ago, so no, they will not win worlds :)
[4:05:47] brandoniannn: only good player on SKT is Khan and Teddy when he is on lucian/vayne

[4:05:59] quem_ehh_john_galt: JUUUUUUKES
[4:05:59] siegfriedOG: cheater
[4:06:05] adroit5927: if they had knight9, RNG has the best roster they can make (aside from Zoom for LangX but Zoom can be inconsistent and resource intensive)
[4:06:10] tobyzzzlpl: I would perfer Zoom Tian Knight Uzi Ming. Full Chinese rosters POG
[4:06:13] edwinzs: @phytrix7 As a RNG fab I don't want to be that disappointed again so let start slow
[4:06:15] shiny_chocobo: JDG need to find themselves again
[4:06:18] svens_ex_boyfriend: @brandoniannn thinking khant is good LUL
[4:06:20] mrpinkxxxxx: SKT will come when they have to..like everytime
[4:06:31] m00nrabbits: you still want Zoom after that last game?
[4:06:39] phytrix7: @adroit5927 Zoom has looked horrible this season
[4:06:39] Drekt: I mean, do you really want knight and UZI on the same team?
[4:06:47] tobyzzzlpl: Yeah my faith tho
[4:06:49] sugarloww: Boys. Whole LCK is pretty close skill wise. any team can win vs SKT and twke G2 to at least 3rd game in bo3
[4:06:52] phytrix7: He may well be THE reason his team is losing these games
[4:06:58] m00nrabbits: fair enough
[4:07:01] brandoniannn: khan is good when skt doesnt fucking give him a losing matchup everygame lol
[4:07:05] Drekt: Uzi warps space around himself after all.
[4:07:09] brandoniannn: skt garbage drafters
[4:07:19] storegitte: @mrpinkxxxxx SKT is washed up. Faker is not even top 3 in mids anymore and Khan ints too much, Mata is washed up aswell. Clid and Teddy are fairly new and they need to carry the 3 washed up players.
[4:07:20] brandoniannn: like holy shit so bad
[4:07:21] sugarloww: It's just that SKT have incredinle headspace and patience
[4:07:28] brandoniannn: almost as bad as tsm yesterday

[4:08:33] adroit5927: tian might be better than karsa but karsa is proven at international events(MSI)
[4:08:36] phytrix7: SKT will get better. There's a reason why they have been a top team for so many years, every single split. They know how to adapt
[4:08:43] brandoniannn: dread + kiin in kr soloq have like 95% wr or something absolutely ridiculous in top of kr chally
[4:08:44] Pradashiva: also Af draft was very good
[4:08:54] mrpinkxxxxx: SKT <3 <3 :D
[4:08:56] brandoniannn: im sad kiin and ruler and bdd arent on the same team
[4:08:58] m00nrabbits: does buying the best players in each role count as adapting
[4:09:08] sugarloww: You can't discredit their ability to not lose a game
[4:09:17] tyx20200: this year's RR will be very interesting, most Spring top 4 teams in LPL and LCK are playing badly now
[4:09:22] storegitte: KZ are the favorites and look the best atm in LCK
[4:09:31] sugarloww: But LCK teams are so close in skill
[4:09:33] brandoniannn: GRF looks really good still
[4:09:40] brandoniannn: and KZ
[4:09:59] sugarloww: Rhere are like 4teams that can finisk LCK first
[4:09:59] adroit5927: i want to see karsa knight synergy
[4:10:01] sqradi: @tyx20200 looks like RR will be a clown fiesta FeelsGoodMan
[4:10:03] phytrix7: @m00nrabbits 2 of their members they've had since the start, other 3 were not all proven top tier players on joining
[4:10:05] sugarloww: And theyre all good
[4:10:06] storegitte: Do you guys believe in KT?

[4:21:49] phytrix7: Flawless' Chinese is ok, he's been in Chinese teams for 3 years you would hope so..
[4:22:04] brandoniannn: zoom held back by team quite a bit too

[4:49:08] Lorenzette: 343 CS PogChamp
[4:49:10] phytrix7: There is a definite tier system for casters is all I'm saying
[4:49:22] HystericsCasts: I'm definitely a big fan of Uber over in the Overwatch League
[4:49:28] whateverittakesgoddamnit: most casters are really bad its not easy
[4:49:41] EsportsTj: Uber is one of the best PBPs I have ever heard.
[4:49:51] CertainlySomeoneHere: Well,w hile not every caster is great, I think as long as they have the mindset to improve that already puts them higher in my opinion
[4:49:52] phytrix7: Monte cristo is my favourite caster, knows exactly what he's talking about
[4:50:03] HystericsCasts: Monte and Doa another amazing duo
[4:50:10] Ketaknaller: Monte BibleThump
[4:50:11] phytrix7: Phreak is another good one, very entertaining and great game knowledge, even tho hes an old man. Doa legendary
[4:50:14] EsportsTj: I haven't really liked their OWL casting
[4:50:24] whateverittakesgoddamnit: PepeHands old ogn
[4:50:32] CertainlySomeoneHere: I don't watch OWL
[4:50:33] EsportsTj: They still are really smooth conversationalists, but it feels like they fall short at mainstage hype for OWL
[4:50:37] Clairfoyance: lot of Lol casters lack personality LUL
[4:50:37] NiCoThyMe: Odpixel
[4:50:39] EsportsTj: haven't watched since S1 though.
[4:50:40] Cryonik: LUL fid ult
[4:50:43] whateverittakesgoddamnit: phreak is a good one Kappa
[4:50:43] ScuffedSaiyan: Fiddle OMEGALUL
[4:50:46] babydeul: old LCK BibleThump
[4:50:47] belacqua_: I was trying to find an OGN vod the other day and they've all been deleted :(
[4:50:51] phytrix7: HUGE ULT

[4:51:34] Venxar: GO EDG
[4:51:41] belacqua_: He didn't miss he just didn't want to trade his life for it
[4:51:44] Ketaknaller: @belacqua_tp You can find quite a lot of s3/s4 OGN games with their casting
[4:51:49] EsportsTj: PUBG casters are actually really good
[4:51:52] Ketaknaller: on youtube
[4:52:02] EsportsTj: People sleep on them because no one talks about PUBG esports anymore
[4:52:10] sqradi: scout lul
[4:52:13] CertainlySomeoneHere: @EsportsTj hey I haven't watched in a while, but how do you think Wuffie is?
[4:52:14] Poilkj2009: miss DansGame
[4:52:21] EsportsTj: but their EU and NA talent teams are solid.
[4:52:23] Lorenzette: J LUL G
[4:52:26] phytrix7: So what happened with the wage dispute with Monte and DOA?
[4:52:41] belacqua_: @88_jt oh thats cool. I was looking for S4 Summer final KTA vs SSB
[4:53:00] Clairfoyance: @phytrix7 they left LoL for OW LUL
[4:53:19] whateverittakesgoddamnit: i dont blame them for leaving
[4:53:22] EsportsTj: @CertainlySomeoneHere I think I get more work then Wuffie so I feel weird analysing him.
[4:53:31] phytrix7: @Lofi_Chill I remember there being some issue with Riot beforehand, was there more info on that?
[4:53:38] phytrix7: Or did they keep the dispute under wraps
[4:53:42] EsportsTj: I only critique casters that are better then me
[4:53:43] CertainlySomeoneHere: @EsportsTj I'm yet to see your casting one day :)
[4:54:04] phytrix7: and thats game
[4:54:10] EsportsTj: Wuffie seemed really good though when I saw some of his paladins stuff.
[4:54:16] LmaoLp: @phytrix7 they did succeed in that riot bumped up the contract casters pay significantly, unsure about their wage casters.
[4:54:21] Ketaknaller: @belacqua_tp pretty pretty sure those are still up on yt, quality can suck tho
[4:54:22] belacqua_: @phytrix7 you'd need to dig into the old reddit threads, basically Monte bought a team and his business partner was super shady, Riot ended up kicking them both out
[4:54:24] EsportsTj: I hope he gets more work, I think he was doing Brawlstars.
[4:54:31] EsportsTj: Supercell has big esports money
[4:54:32] 3323ssss: Z LUL LUL M
[4:54:38] CertainlySomeoneHere: Yeah. I hope wuffie is doing all right overall

[4:59:11] Fortilux1: Use watch.lolesports LUL
[4:59:13] CertainlySomeoneHere: Also like. YT is a platform for videos. Twitch is one for streams. Trust me, using them for those goals respectively works the best

[5:01:15] PreacherCasts: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
[5:01:17] sqradi: huya streams english broadcast though
[5:01:25] whateverittakesgoddamnit: best thing about youtube is u can skip back and forth also u can watch at 2x the speed to catch up
[5:01:32] EsportsTj: I don't know what to think.
[5:01:38] HystericsCasts: Trust the community not me
[5:01:48] usedxsoul: @whateverittakesgoddamnit you can do the same on twitch lmao
[5:01:49] CertainlySomeoneHere: @cursedexistance I guess
[5:01:58] EsportsTj: I normally trust Australia though.
[5:01:59] PreacherCasts: I gave the truth but also said "yeeeeeeet" so you're conflicted as to whether to believe me or not?
[5:02:03] whateverittakesgoddamnit: @UsedxSoul no u cant
[5:02:15] HystericsCasts: Trusting an Australian gets you a drop bear and a groin kick from a kangaroo
[5:02:23] whateverittakesgoddamnit: only if ur watching a vod
[5:02:34] EsportsTj: I was just in Aus and I didn't even see a kangaroo
