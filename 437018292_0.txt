[0:25:23] NateTheScot: mostly because of timezones honestly
[0:25:30] NateTheScot: america is asleep, europe only just waking up
[0:25:34] FlinchFlinch: LCK gets 20k consistently

[0:26:53] NateTheScot: its funny watching NA teams in the LCS try strats and picks from G2 at MSI
[0:26:56] FlinchFlinch: iG vs RNG barely cracks 10k
[0:27:01] NateTheScot: and failing hard coz they don't understand how to use pyke top
[0:27:14] NateTheScot: they just lock it in and then don't play aggressively to make use of the double goldshare passive on kills

[0:33:42] sqradi: if v5 wins that 1 person is going to be rich
[0:33:47] sqradi: LUL
[0:33:53] NateTheScot: the most satisfying part of G2's victory over TL was the mental victory, where TL are now trying to use G2 strats in LCS and failing... which is just so glorious to watch xD
[0:33:58] Boogielol: ig should stomp v5 ^^ dont expect exciting matches
[0:34:26] wntwang: IG is No.9 place in LPL now
[0:34:50] Boogielol: the played against 2 teams only lol
[0:35:01] Boogielol: the season just started so it has like nothing to say
[0:35:12] NateTheScot: honestly the real MSI finals was the SKT G2 match... that was one of the most hype Bo5s i've seen in league in years
[0:35:21] PG88807783: @NateTheScot but no one asked
[0:35:35] Boogielol: true dat
[0:35:40] PG88807783: why u talking to yourself?

[0:39:28] Boogielol: hoi
[0:39:41] HarisUzair: China is really underestimated here in the west
[0:39:57] emibtw: BibleThump
[0:40:01] CertainlySomeoneHere: I dunno either but I love LPL certai1Hype
[0:40:14] HarisUzair: And they beat EU in the World Finals last year so that gives them extra hete @elikaweli

[0:41:34] 101shiki: Hey guys, ready to watch some CN fiesta while Twitch chat argues about EU and NA for some reason? PogChamp
[0:41:37] slachi: Chinese disco PogChamp
[0:42:00] CertainlySomeoneHere: And honestly, I don't really care about how good or bad the players are in comparison to other regions. I mostly watch LPL cause of the casters and just the time.
[0:42:09] hardenfull: lck not proactive
[0:42:17] HarisUzair: I try to watch all regions
[0:42:30] CertainlySomeoneHere: I watch multiple regions as well, but mostly LPL
[0:42:43] slachi: @aqnguyen96 LPL casters are awful and ruin the viewer experience. Compared to Atlas and Papa who are among the best casters in the world.
[0:42:53] 101shiki: I just watch whatever region is on, but as a morning person, LPL and LCK are always on during my slow productive hours
[0:43:01] HarisUzair: I mostly watch LEC because it's the best time for me, I am from EU, my favourite team is Liquid tho
[0:43:14] CertainlySomeoneHere: LPL casters make my viewing experience great, excuse you LUL

I believe if KR sent AFS they would win the Bo5 vs G2 3-2,, AFS just beat SKT easily, Optic is by far the best NA team and TL who beat IG is mid tier in NA right now.. tells you how strong the region got and LPL teams are beating IG now.
