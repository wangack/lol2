[0:50:43] besirup: because it's referencing a certain event

[0:51:31] NateTheScot: @russianbot2016 yea he's still good, but he won't be able to "outplay" people 1v2 at low hp because of spamming out spells for insane shielding. he'll actually be a lot more reasonable now and rely on hitting spells instead of just crazy passive shielding to sustain
[0:51:36] parqueso: @Clement_LoL This is Parkes btw.

[2:00:38] keebao: @stopat3bars jiizuke was MAYBE a top 3 mid while playing well. if we talk about peak he might be top 5 depending on how rookies turn out
[2:00:40] LmaoLp: weird plex, but okay.
[2:00:41] liltrapster: Khan and Mata are utter trash
[2:00:42] HystericsCasts: SKT Khan FeelsBadMan
[2:00:45] dizzzlo: caps is the only reason I even watched any EU games LUL
[2:00:48] hermeneutist: IG is great at laning and teamfighting; but they don't seem to have the creative drafts to match G2 (outside of uhhh picking kayn)
[2:00:48] unclearhate: @defl0rate OMEGALUL
[2:01:00] tuerance: ***
[2:01:08] Vens5: SKT Bang FeelsBadMan EleGiggle
[2:01:09] Jefe7abibi: Most league pro chats are ResidentSleeper but this one is actually PogChamp constructive conversation with industry pros
[2:01:11] follettortuga27: CAPS IS A MONSTER
[2:01:11] liltrapster: Khan made a few plays on LZ and skt got a boner and signed him cos of that
[2:01:14] kne_: @elminster316 Wunder is actually the best top laner in europe, and of course top tier
[2:01:17] follettortuga27: AND FAKER IS A LEGEND
[2:01:19] liltrapster: so dumb
[2:01:22] TheFakeOneGG: naah
[2:01:30] Vens5: Claps Kreygasm
[2:01:31] zabel_10: Khan is not that bad, but wunder and theshy are monsters
[2:01:32] liltrapster: and the shyte is finally being outed a fraud
[2:01:33] Desroctre: I think this chat understimate G2 roster too much xD
[2:01:42] hermeneutist: honestly, SKT can just get khan to play late game scaling and clid hard camp for faker
[2:01:43] liltrapster: the shyte is washed up and horrible
[2:01:48] dizzzlo: a few plays?? Khan was a monster on kz for multi0le seasons lol
[2:01:48] serbarristan2nd: when i play like LEC/G2 crazy style i can play longer at higher lvl.. korean disciplined style im tired after 3 match
[2:01:50] Clairfoyance: Wunder is not only best top in EU but best top in the world LUL
[2:01:51] Warwizard23: A lot of top laners in general can be liabilities w/o decent junglers
[2:01:51] TheFakeOneGG: Khan was a revolution on LZ. Completely different level of lane domination from what we've seen before
[2:01:51] X4PPY: SKT TheShy
[2:01:54] liltrapster: khant is ovverraeted
[2:01:57] 21044275: Khan got destroyed by Bwipo, Khan is terrible

[2:02:08] MagikLimbo: Faker SeemsGood Fakers solo stream keyboard WutFace
[2:02:15] HystericsCasts: With IG performing horribly, I don't think I would bet against G2 internationally unless RNG/EDG/FPX continued to dominate
[2:02:16] TemplarXVI: @im_the_green_arrow yep, wunder is best player west atm
[2:02:17] Vens5: kids dont take Twitch Chat too serious.. NotLikeThis FailFish
[2:02:20] hermeneutist: khan just looked good cos LCK was still playing tank tops
[2:02:22] YSZN: Idk if ig needs to out-creative G2. they just need to perform at previous levels. It looks doubtful though with ning/lucas and then theshy saying "it doesn't matter if i die" I couldn't imagine faker making that comment saying his lane/position not mattering
[2:02:26] Jefe7abibi: The old razer "stealth" LUL @NiyttOwl
[2:02:27] ogremoch: Mata is less of a liability than Khan though
[2:02:30] kanz19: LUL
[2:02:31] unclearhate: EDG internationally LUL
[2:02:33] 21044275: SKT's entire roster is trash, Khan awful, Faker Mata washed up and Clid some random lpl jungler

[2:02:35] dupiewer: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:02:39] liltrapster: skt only have 3 good players, and id probably say 2 cause faker is just pure garbage rn but obviously who would say that
[2:02:43] dizzzlo: Khan was a monster but as soon as he went to skt he became trash. you know why? because skt ruins players LUL
[2:02:44] HystericsCasts: EDG internationally is indeed a LUL though you're right
[2:02:47] hermeneutist: oh, EDG looks super clean, like wtf where were they hiding this
[2:02:48] tuanchuduc: Chrome developer
[2:02:53] kne_: @ehddnjs9081 why?

[2:03:00] Â±ÖË∏¢Ê≠ê: ?
[2:03:01] Stopat3bars: FPX and TOP are very new teams, i wouldnt expect them to go out guns blazing in a international major
[2:03:03] X4PPY: @xg32 Faker's ryze was just sad to watch
[2:03:03] elminster316: Khan was never a monst LUL
[2:03:10] 21044275: SKT's average age is 23, that's god awful
[2:03:10] tuerance: RIOT ?
[2:03:10] Ackelope: with how close the SKT vs G2 games were at MSI I'd feel pretty confident in placing them as a contender at the very least
[2:03:13] sqradi: EDG didnt hide anything they just got a new toplaner now
[2:03:16] HystericsCasts: I would expect FPX to break some backs at worlds if they went
[2:03:17] Clairfoyance: @hermeneutist i mean they used to play with ray heavy weight LUL
[2:03:18] Vens5: neeko still 3 / 0 PogChamp
[2:03:21] dizzzlo: ??? lol what Khan was a beast what is this chat talking about

[2:03:23] kumnpie: i ate trash
[2:03:23] Excomm: Flandre is getting clapped
[2:03:33] liltrapster: all khan did was farmed late as fiora and renekton and made a 1v2 'outplay' and everyone got a boner
[2:03:36] elminster316: @ackelope with close u mean G2 inting in draft 2 games ??
[2:03:39] hermeneutist: jinoo is definitely an upgrade over (domestic) ray
[2:03:40] kne_: @Excomm he still up in farm, he can turn around any moment
[2:03:40] 0attackjewel: @dizzzlo he was bad at KZ too LUL and he is never a beast
[2:03:42] TemplarXVI: @im_the_green_arrow i guess so, but not first, first being rookie 2nd teddy, G2 just are better as a team than skt
[2:03:45] HystericsCasts: I love that boner is not blocked in here
[2:03:48] 21044275: Khan got shitted on by Bwipo
[2:03:49] liltrapster: overrhyped trash
[2:03:50] X4PPY: @21044275 dont think thats the problem. If that was the problem the wouldnt have won spring
[2:03:51] dizzzlo: I guess people never watched kingzone games

[2:04:23] hermeneutist: SKT ACTUALLY lost to my freecs :D
[2:04:23] Ackelope: @elminster316 really? I thought even in the group stage games, particularly the second one, that SKT was contesting pretty well with G2 and even in the lead a decent portion of the time.
[2:04:25] voidlings: why so much hate for skt?
[2:04:25] fazed343: Is this LCK?

[3:30:31] EmilyTK93: @TheDuckAbuser absolutely agree. she's so good

[3:39:39] Emerkrik: @Yolo_pete Wunder's anything is the best. I think he's the best, or at least top 3, toplaner in the world rn.

[3:40:27] Helmzee: @luitenantcupcake his way of speaking definitely isn't for everyone, and I don't think he understands that, hes a great mind about league just don't think he learned people skills, i think hes making an attempt to now with being a coach and analyst

[3:40:51] hermeneutist: he resigned from bbq tho, last i heard

[3:41:01] Emerkrik: @101shiki wouldn't the game be boring as hell though if every champ was confined to a single role?

[3:41:25] Ackelope: in my experience LS is usually reasonably patient with people who are patient with him and respectful in a decent amount of interactions

[3:42:20] alexlipson: @X4PPY ye like I don't get it, should LS talk 10 minutes about things that are absolutely irrelevant? He makes the farming state where nothing happens legitimately funny so I enjoy his casts at weekends
