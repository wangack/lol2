[1:19:50] nomegalulrth: @gogojuice69 its hard to play with 3 clear carries. JL is good because he doesnt demand so much attention and ning can focus on other lanes
[1:19:52] icant_kekw: @bfrogue 2016 RNG also to SSG in groups, them running into SKT wouldn’t have mattered, if they also ran into ROX or somehow managed to reached SSG in finals
[1:19:58] bfrogue: jackeylove lost to NA, that is no excuse for that
[1:19:59] vinea53: IG put resources to their solo lanes RNG puts it botlane

[1:21:54] STONEFREE__: real gamer glasses SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:22:02] bfrogue: rng with all three lanes on carries is the best version of rng
[1:22:22] icant_kekw: It’s that it’s easiest to play around UZI and Ming, since RNG win lane so often around bot
[1:22:26] pepega_kkona_chan_ayaya: @nindoges *Ming get it right 😡
[1:22:40] bfrogue: UZI win lanes on his own, karsa going bot dont change that
[1:22:44] icant_kekw: @filthyweeb75 OH FREAK.
[1:22:51] Nauk: he used default premade ones pretty much and he played like someone who didint want to be there @CertainlySomeoneHere XD

[1:23:02] CertainlySomeoneHere: @nauk rip
[1:23:03] sqradi: since rng's botlane wins lane no matter what they should put more attention to the solo lanes which is what they are going now SeemsGood

[1:23:36] feng91212: where is MLXG
[1:23:53] bfrogue: last year, they had letme, he wasn't good on carries
[1:24:18] sqradi: @nomegalulrth they didnt in worlds though
[1:24:23] pepega_kkona_chan_ayaya: @KR_WORST_REGION ning wasn't really the best lpl jungler to begin with at spring imo
[1:24:28] nomegalulrth: He was actually decent on carries they just didnt play through him in important matches
[1:24:49] bfrogue: karsa is the best jungler in lpl, he been carrying rng all summer split
[1:25:00] CertainlySomeoneHere: I think playing through your jungle as carry is a risky decission
[1:25:24] CertainlySomeoneHere: After all, early on, junglers have that EXP disadvantage
[1:25:25] bfrogue: with karsa, that isn't risky at all

[1:28:12] goblinguy01: G2 has to beat an LPL team to win worlds to make it worth it imo. G2 can crush NA and beat Korea
[1:28:12] vicviper: letme can play carry, but RNG was so focused on protecting Uzi strat he can't pick
