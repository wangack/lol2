[0:37:43] MNAZerk: @Ti1Dendiii bruh please i've had this account since 2012; im not from china. some people in china can use twitch (such as hong kong or people with VPNs), but censorship is a bit more enforced overthere so i wouldnt be surprised if twitch is banned for mainstream consumption
[0:38:15] Dendii7: ive seen a lot of chinese people in other streams

[0:38:45] Dendii7: maybe LPL is just boring

[1:02:06] Clackbat13: 3 seems fair. Lcs na and eu gets 3 spots to world most of the time same with lck and lpl
[1:02:07] Double_Hitt: Rookie had to go come bc of family health reasons stfu
[1:02:07] Zebrios: Championship teams have to be consistent in their plays. That's why G2 wins, and why China often fails at major tournaments. They have pop off games, but then they have huge dips.

[1:13:25] MNAZerk: solo queue rank doesnt matter too much for seasoned pros, but teams still expect at least diamond1-3+ in soloQ from all their players. LCS/LPL correlation to solo queue as many pros will tell u, is mediocre at best.

[2:01:36] popadoseyoo: ah
[2:01:36] Nibiria: pause POG
[2:01:41] LmaoLp: @popadoseyoo basically re-creates the game state for them and they can rewind it to a time before there was action so they can dive back in without it being janky
[2:01:46] Tevb0t: What’s a remake? A remake is when you restart the entire split
[2:01:46] bfrogue: quinn is so rare, the last time i saw a quinn top was when kiin played him like a god.
[2:01:49] Lispaunt: chronebreak is not ok for the used ults. seju missed the ult and its a big deal i think
[2:01:50] popadoseyoo: LUL eitherway this isn so unfair!!!
[2:01:51] hadizi: See u guys in 2 hours
[2:01:55] 8kuji777: @CriMeD_22 really broken with her 48% winrate in 9.12
[2:01:57] MNAZerk: yeah chronobreak shit. remakes are absolutely a nono these days. complete BS especially in a meta this snowbally
[2:01:57] Deceiv3dDeceiv3rEUNE: @quote_if_game_paused Jebaited
[2:01:58] zandelcorrin: @popadoseyoo It's when they rewind the game to a point before the issue that caused the pause since they have the same game running on 2-3 servers at once in case the primary server dies.
[2:01:59] dannyyeo: @leaniv170 china LOL keep team fighting , hahaha NA keep stick 5 and not team fighting . whyy ?? im new actually
[2:02:07] sharperfisel: Bigger
[2:02:12] bogdan_vre: did they say what the reason for pause was?
[2:02:21] 8kuji777: @CriMeD_22 a slightly behind quinn is irrelevant
[2:02:23] LmaoLp: @bogdan_vre mom boom
[2:02:33] Lispaunt: no they didn't right?
[2:02:36] merthins: They have to make a full remake, if they chronobreak this V5 would lose their 5v4 fight and game
[2:02:38] wickyky: <3
[2:02:48] popadoseyoo: wow time to go log on to my mom's challenger account now
[2:02:50] yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyz: diaoxianle

[2:03:00] AnOldDinosaur: Rewind it too far and they probably won’t even take that teamfight they just started NotLikeThis
[2:03:04] LmaoLp: @merthins thems the breaks, it'll be a chronobreak in spite of that in all likelihood
[2:03:07] zandelcorrin: @bogdan_vre The game literally crashed in a team fight... we had a full frame by frame slide show for a few seconds then it just stopped.

[2:04:23] Tevb0t: Y
[2:04:30] MNAZerk: remakes are not legitimate, in my opinion, which is probably why they stopped nearly all of them after season 2. a form of unintended cheating for the team that's behind. no thanks.
[2:04:31] Tevb0t: Cancel my bets then lmfao

[2:08:10] hopess_: @camotitoasado it not over its in a pause
[2:08:10] Thorinis_B: lul
[2:08:19] MNAZerk: @merthins while i agree from strictly a pick/ban point of view that it favors VG, the play from the sylas this game is probably too much to recover from
[2:08:28] perfectrotation7: LAN*
[2:08:30] 7ricardinho: that's sucks.. i was enjoying quinn with a lot of kills
[2:08:31] popadoseyoo: they tied and are deciding to do rock paper scissors or arm wrestle to decide
[2:08:34] AnOldDinosaur: Error: game is a mess and crashed in a teamfight BrokeBack
[2:08:38] EPICPEARS: LAN* BTW
[2:08:40] zandelcorrin: @Tevb0t They can unpause if the problem is not there, but the game seemed to crash no just pause.

[2:09:27] ShadeOfMidgar: F
[2:09:33] merthins: @MNAZerk It doesn't matter when it's a 5v4 fight with multiple ults expended, only Xayah and Rumble had ult left. They cannot chronobreak this, when that fight was gonna decide the game, and the chronobreak would remove the situation.
[2:09:37] zandelcorrin: Raz? you mean Lucian?

[2:10:55] alfeell: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:10:57] MNAZerk: @merthins you can tell it was a poor engage already from sylas' team, they're bunched up against a wall and they initiated prior to any problems like crashes/laag appearing. Maybe you'd have a point if it wasn't bo3 but im really not seeing it here.
[2:10:58] 0815Taktak: it?

[2:15:02] bfrogue: JUST GIVE IT TO VG, THEY HAD BARON BUFF AND MOMENTUM.
[2:15:04] MNAZerk: they're litteraly going to chronobreak it to the frame prior to the rubber-banding. It's not going to be any different than it would have turned out anyways. sylas' team has bad positioning and is behind alrdy anyways. no one is going to "get their ult back"
[2:15:04] frozen_ashe: thinking missing sej ult hurt them it was a bait for rumble ult
[2:15:09] AnOldDinosaur: @bfrogue Ok but how does remaking the whole game fix that. Better to have a few seconds not matter over the whole 30minutes meaning nothing
[2:15:10] yudai95: ryze
[2:15:12] Lispaunt: no won but many tilts

[3:26:31] Nibiria: @SeriousRising i mean the meta has to shift then right? i don't think kogmaw's kit is problematic or weak or anything

[3:26:38] haypah: @raisin1118 you have time to take a bubblebath
[3:26:41] Heartfeylia: Oh yeah this game only, so remake?
[3:26:49] hatescreamx: ResidentSleeper
[3:26:51] Nibiria: @CertainlySomeoneHere i'm still not sure on that one, varus obviously but we've only seen it on his poke build previously
[3:26:55] xRainnluck: just start the fucking game
[3:26:59] VizeReZ: meta would have to slow down, go back to long front to back team fighting.

[3:27:47] CertainlySomeoneHere: @cursedexistance was not aware of that
[3:27:50] SeriousRising: @nibiria yeah I guess it needs to be more tank meta. Maybe figure out what riot wants rageblade to be?
[3:28:02] 풍미모락: FailFish
[3:28:08] CertainlySomeoneHere: Rageblade still is viable if you go full on hit, right?
[3:28:19] SeriousRising: Longest pause in LPL history
[3:28:27] Nibiria: rageblade was a big reason for kog losing a lot of power alongside other on-hit ADCs
[3:28:28] LmaoLp: @CertainlySomeoneHere it actually is really good for the poke build, but the problem is that it doesn't capitalize on varus' early game strength in lane as you're setting yourself behind with the tear somewhat.

[6:06:30] Gigzur: OMEGALUL verwatch
[6:06:31] scottoflorida2014: Yeah WOW was the best and original
[6:06:34] TheDarkYoshi: @scottofl2014 yeah but lots of players complain about salaries, you cant even stream cuz no one watches dota like that-- its not the best esports to go into
[6:06:40] yudai95: @scottofl2014 overwatch i think its called

[6:09:36] DaveSnow: @scottofl2014 Not even Iron... ?
[6:09:37] Clairfoyance: @scottofl2014 that should last for a year or 2 LUL they need long term plan for their franchises

The figure came from Activision Blizzard's full-year earnings report today. It's up 42 percent over 2015's total of $4.66 billion.
[6:11:27] TheDarkYoshi: Hearthstone is up and down, it loses viewers half way into the expansion, once a new expansion comes out, it gets big again
[6:11:40] kancellar1: @yudai95 not a lot ? How many viewers worlds final had ? 240k-250k ?
[6:11:51] grrrrit: yeah you guys know exactly what your talking about with activision, do you think blizzard cares about your thoughts or money
