[1:46:26] sqradi: EDG have drafting problems

[5:46:00] CriMeD_22: weebs OMEGALUL
[5:46:08] Nibiria: @Send_Trihards_To_TheSpace they ran their sub support every series except the most recent one
[5:46:10] IonIyTop: @nibiria who's your favorite to win, FPX or RNG?
[5:46:11] balde_runner: Rookie was the problem
[5:46:13] Enyxus: any more games?
[5:46:15] dragoni888: theShy finally showed up on the rift
[5:46:30] dragoni888: been missing since MSI
[5:46:44] fridaychill: Theshy was still pretty underwhealming
[5:47:09] liverpool_numba1: The shy is missing after MSI, punished by TL
[5:47:16] dragoni888: At least he was carrying for once instead of getting carried by jackeylove
[5:47:26] balde_runner: Impact broke Theshy FeelsBadMan
[5:47:41] dragoni888: what?! theShy was losing to every one at MSi
[5:47:42] liverpool_numba1: DL LUL
[5:47:52] rebeccamo: didn't remember theshy carry any game in MSI
[5:47:58] liverpool_numba1: DL >PERKZ
[5:48:01] zTurnel: that guy looks like nicktron
[5:48:10] Nibiria: @IonIyTop mmmm, fpx
[5:48:19] dragoni888: DL had the 2nd worst stats at MSI of all adcs
[5:48:20] Nibiria: despite their shaky performance today i trust my man doinb
[5:48:26] Nibiria: but if they look the same they did today then yikes
[5:48:29] balde_runner: @rebeccamo I think he had a good Akali game
[5:48:36] Nibiria: rng will take it if they don't clean it up a bit
[5:48:40] Nibiria: but i have faith in FPX
[5:49:12] rebeccamo: @dreamyhead oh thanks i remember that now
[5:49:15] dragoni888: Jackeylove being the main carry at MSI doesn't sound like IG
[5:50:09] IonIyTop: @nibiria I want FPX to win honestly, but I feel like bit lane is gonna be an issua because, well, Uzi
[5:50:26] IonIyTop: @nibiria bot*
[5:50:34] Nibiria: @IonIyTop fpx can mitigate a lot of issues by using doinb and tian as a roaming gank squad but karsa and xiaohu can lock them down
[5:50:44] Nibiria: so if they can't get rolling i agree
[5:50:48] Nibiria: bot lane will look not great
[5:51:12] Zeliazz: anymore games today?
[5:51:16] Longc8: who won
[5:51:19] tobbypeide: uzi >>>>>>>>LWX
[5:51:52] balde_runner: @Longc8 FPX
[5:51:56] tobbypeide: ning LUL LUL LUL
[5:52:06] spritutu: ning
[5:52:12] 블랙파이어: R.I.P IG Rookie is gone
[5:52:33] 好了啦台主: SN vs. DMO WHO Won?
[5:52:33] spritutu: kramer>jackeylove>uzi
[5:52:39] IonIyTop: @nibiria yeah, it will come down to whether FPX mid/JG duo can outperform RNG's to translate thekr advantage to bot and help them, otherwise Uzi will just carry with Karsa and Xiaohu supporting him as always. But it's gonna be a great series either way
[5:52:48] Nibiria: for sure
[5:52:50] Nibiria: hopefully 3 games
