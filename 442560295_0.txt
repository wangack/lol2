[3:48:19] brandoniannn: @bfrogue i agree with that, but saying rookie isnt a huge issue and acting like flex picks are singlehandedly the issue is missing the bigger picture
[3:48:24] bfrogue: IG better hope riot change the meta to the favor again. because they can't play in anything but a flex meta.
[3:48:27] brandoniannn: @roqtt okay that's fair
[3:48:27] tsmfansaredelusional: @bfrogue there are a lot of teams that are meta centric, IG with flex picks, RNG with bot lane, SSG with vision

[5:48:56] dragoni888: @estenoespedobearxd EU only did well twice at worlds 2015 and 2018, only reason is because Riot changes the meta leading up to worlds
[5:49:21] 3kke: who won
[5:49:26] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: @edwinzs c u when rng lose in worlds like always lol

[5:50:19] annxrae: true, duke is reliable
[5:50:23] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: @dragoni888 eu did only good in msi 2019 lol but rng or fpx wont win nothing they are good for lpl? ig will win
[5:50:39] brandoniannn: theshy is quite volatile
[5:50:50] cifra358: Ig win ?
[5:50:50] brandoniannn: makes good when toplane is carry vs carry tho
[5:50:55] dragoni888: @estenoespedobearxd on EU has one MSI, LPL and LCK has 2
[5:50:58] brandoniannn: yee
[5:51:08] ATLien26: Vitality RNG bootcamp tilted them off the planet in EU LUL
[5:51:21] brandoniannn: i mean G2/FNC are lightyears above rest of EU imo
[5:51:35] will_o_will: Vitality cant handle chinese girls
[5:51:40] xqf052: not forge mvp?
[5:51:42] bushtheteemo: Origin is the only other team close.
[5:51:59] brandoniannn: i dont even think origin is close tbh, so inconsistent
[5:52:07] brandoniannn: just too many mistakes
[5:52:12] Shinji10TH: @ATLien26 LPL teams never really scrim seriously, it was known for years, Vitality literally wasted their offseason on nothing LuL
[5:52:16] VauntDanial: Origen is a bridge between 4th and 2nd In EU but still not close to FNC and G2
[5:52:23] brandoniannn: ^
[5:52:35] Mr_Febreeze_007: origen has no upside unless Kold or Nukeduck is popping off
[5:52:39] 澀澀母莎奈朵: 0-5 LUL
[5:52:48] brandoniannn: nukeduck is the saving grace for OG
[5:52:58] brandoniannn: he has a nice champ pool and smart with matchups
[5:53:03] PatMaweeny: @brandoniannn never been a fan of og glad that fnc pushed them down. Dont like their playstyle or their personality and im tired of deficio hyping them up all the time
[5:53:06] dragoni888: Can't wait to watch the two strongest current teams face off

[5:54:04] dragoni888: G2 still can't say confidenttally they can beat IG
[5:54:29] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: IG is the only salvation of LPL
[5:54:33] 貪蘋果: HeyGuys
[5:54:38] brandoniannn: g2 just needs to get a more consistent read on picks and they do fine because theyre all still mechanically gifted
[5:54:41] miracle_sha: HeyGuys
[5:54:43] BluePlaysVideos: song name please
[5:54:49] Sing3d: HeyGuys
[5:54:52] BluePlaysVideos: whats this song called
[5:54:55] brandoniannn: akali/irelia are not as much 1v9 material vs strong picks like renekton
[5:55:05] machaking: is this the end today?
[5:55:15] BluePlaysVideos: does anyone know the name of this song
[5:55:21] brandoniannn: grf is the most across the board talented team imo
[5:55:22] odo07: SourPls
[5:55:28] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: @brandoniannn G2 almost lost vs SkT trolling drafts lol
[5:55:34] Sing3d: The Akali pick on p2 was a joke
[5:55:47] machaking: use Shazam
[5:55:51] brandoniannn: yea but skt still had a high ceiling at the time
[5:55:58] brandoniannn: idk wtf skt draft coach doing
[5:56:08] dragoni888: @estenoespedobearxd RNG 2 world finals 1 msi win, G2 1 worlds semi, 1 msi win, like wtf you talking , don't forget the rest of the times G2 got knocked out at worlds groups
[5:56:11] will_o_will: g2 beat tl tho
[5:56:21] brandoniannn: xiaohu looks super in form
[5:56:30] brandoniannn: dude is hungry
[5:56:31] bushtheteemo: XL should beat TL LUL
[5:56:53] edwinzs: @dragoni888 Ignore him, he probably have mental problems
