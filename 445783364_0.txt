[2:02:14] Lorenzette: @yingyang777 fnc can't beat top teams lck and lpl
[2:02:30] Kazuhiro1: @Lorenzette the top 3 of LCK? Yes they could

[2:09:33] QuarkStorm: @itachi60011 Like I said I'm not as involved as I wish I would be with LPL. I love TES and it's my favorite team so far. I'm more of a NA and LCK watcher
[2:09:35] itachi60011: @RBQuark i think so yeah but they are always kinda mediocre in lpl but they can change and be better idk
[2:09:37] majster69: KappaRoss

[2:09:52] LmaoLp: @razleplasm @Nibiria @hystericscasts can we get a short segment showing the OPL paintings thanks
[2:10:12] itachi60011: @RBQuark its hard to an lpl fan because of lack of advertisment

[2:11:32] Sing3d: CS:GO is ok to watch imo, sometimes even fun. Overwatch on the other hand ... yeah, I have no idea whats going on, lots of VFX and people flying around.
[2:11:42] belacqua_: CSGO is great from viewing perspective, Overwatch is terrible though
[2:11:53] itachi60011: @RBQuark yes they are also really good and dominant, wathc the schedule and try to catch some of their games, rng is also strong rn and ig is ig
