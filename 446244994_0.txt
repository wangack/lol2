[1:28:10] sqradi: it might as well be a lifetime ban 18 months out of league practice ur fcked
[1:28:15] mujarshad: match fixing
[1:28:18] treshFTW: He toon a big risk by matchfixing and he succeed multiple times
[1:28:26] treshFTW: He dont care about 18 months
[1:28:33] AKAROH: What is match fixing? Inting on purpose?
[1:28:38] treshFTW: Im sure he made atleast half a mil
[1:28:46] mujarshad: losing games on purpose
[1:28:46] treshFTW: Ye he was inting
[1:29:03] sqradi: he didnt actually match fix tho
[1:29:06] Sing3d: Very easy to fix matches as jungler
[1:29:07] AKAROH: thats a sha,e
[1:29:10] LmaoLp: @akarozaraki well, 18 month suspension legit is the reason. but if you wanna know why he was suspended, there's a whole furore over him betting on LGD during NEST tournament and apparently NEST organizers tried to force him into matchfixing during LPL after finding out, so he admitted to what he did and took his punishment for it rather than actually matchfix
[1:29:15] Sing3d: "Oh I failed that smite" Kappa
[1:29:15] AKAROH: what a shame
[1:29:18] wws54300: @treshftw no🙅he just bet on match

[1:29:35] Moobot: @goustous This is patch 9.11 PogChamp
[1:29:51] AKAROH: @LmaoLp I see so the reason was him coming out about it then
[1:30:00] treshFTW: @wws54300 if ur betting on a match ur playing and if ur betting the opponent; thats the same as matchfixing
[1:30:10] treshFTW: If u bet 50k on opponent win
[1:30:12] arcussma23: LPL PogChamp LCK ResidentSleeper
[1:30:15] treshFTW: Why would u try hard right
[1:30:20] LmaoLp: @akarozaraki well, it was sort of a rock and a hard place, and he took the more honest option yknow
[1:30:21] vicviper: walking away like a chad
[1:30:26] sqradi: @treshftw no? he bet his own team to win
[1:30:31] treshFTW: No
[1:30:34] LmaoLp: @treshFTW except he bet on his own team to win?
[1:30:42] sqradi: he did a dumb thing but its not matchfixing
[1:30:42] treshFTW: Did he??????
[1:30:47] LmaoLp: yes
[1:30:50] coltluger: betting is banned outright
[1:30:50] wws54300: @treshftw he say someone want he make a fake match
[1:30:50] sqradi: lmao
[1:30:54] Ketaknaller: i'm afraid Yuuki will go for a ''my team yasuo'' cosplay :)
[1:31:00] AKAROH: @LmaoLp He could've just not done beting and play like any other normal player
[1:31:01] coltluger: you will get suspended no matter what you bet on

[1:31:06] treshFTW: Ooo didnt knew
[1:31:07] sqradi: spouting nonsense without source OMEGALUL
[1:31:12] treshFTW: Thiught he bet opponent
[1:31:18] mujarshad: why would you get banned for betting on your own team wtf
[1:31:18] LmaoLp: @akarozaraki it was dumb and he totally admits that, but yeah.
[1:31:19] treshFTW: Sorry!!
[1:32:12] LmaoLp: because gambling as a pro player on an esport you're involved in is against the rules, irrespective of whether or not it's on your own team
[1:32:46] LmaoLp: and by against the rules, it's typically a breach of contract with the game/tournament organizer or your professional teams
[1:32:48] sqradi: he turned himself in because one of his manager wanted to blackmail him into actual matchfixing
[1:33:07] mujarshad: yeah, why though? if I bet on my own team it just means I believe in my team's ability to win some match
[1:33:25] mujarshad: if I lose, I lose money, if I win it means I performed well
[1:33:28] LmaoLp: @mujarshad removes potential for abuse by blanket banning
[1:33:42] Nibiria: it's also indefensible
[1:33:47] wws54300: @mujarshad BloodTrail
[1:33:49] Nibiria: because of the way betting works for these games
[1:33:52] sqradi: because gambling of any kind is illegal if u are a pro
[1:33:53] Nibiria: it's not just "this team wins"
[1:34:00] Ketaknaller: @mujarshad You can just tell the enemy team they get a share of it
[1:34:03] Nibiria: it's who gets first blood? who gets first dragon? who gets first tower
[1:34:09] Nibiria: as the jungler you DICTATE those decisions
[1:34:16] Nibiria: and the gameflow is altered by your participating in these bets
[1:34:21] Nibiria: other ethical ramifications aside, that's not okay
[1:34:43] Nibiria: maybe your teamcomp says you should cede first objective but you bet for it? now you're actively hindering your team

[1:37:20] Ketaknaller: @mujarshad You do realise you can just ask the enemy team to give up first blood for money then right?
[1:37:20] PreacherCasts: It's a bad look. Imagine if you bet on your team on some games but not others. That makes people believe you're fixing through inactivity, and it could also negatively affect your teammates' mindsets because they don't believe you have faith because you regularly bet on your team.
