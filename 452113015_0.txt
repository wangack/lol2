[0:35:36] CombinedZeus: curse vs theshy will be nice
[0:38:14] flamazide: 4-0

[0:44:02] flamazide: everybody
[0:45:45] flamazide: oh shit i didnt know this was a thing
[0:45:57] goblinguy01: FPX broke Griffin
[0:46:10] tacitician: they have some really interesting segments on LPL.
[0:46:17] flamazide: xiaopeng is one of my favorite junglers. i wish the team was doing better
[0:46:38] goblinguy01: First Griffin loses to mid Panth, and GenG beats them with Support Volibear. Griffin had to ban Bear and Panth 4Head
[0:46:38] 蓮緒柊初: Make America great again
[0:47:10] NocturnVenomKRYP: Yeah! U S A, U S A
[0:47:17] goblinguy01: Could he work on EDG or WE?

[0:47:30] NocturnVenomKRYP: R.I.P VG
[0:47:41] goblinguy01: Whatever dark magic DoinB and FPX did. Griffin is tilted
[0:48:06] flamazide: xiaopeng? id like to see him on JDG. i really dont think flawless is good on that team
[0:48:35] goblinguy01: Flawless, Imp, and Yagao drag the team down.
[0:48:52] flamazide: yagao doesnt drag anyone down
[0:48:54] goblinguy01: Zoom and Lvmao can't 2v8 :(

[0:51:43] goblinguy01: Imp and Flawless don't deserve to be import slots
[0:52:16] goblinguy01: Imp should have stayed benched on World Elite
[0:52:59] ngocduyvn369: khuawj
[0:53:14] ngocduyvn369: no one ?
[0:53:32] flamazide: yeah i agree that there are probably a lot of chinese players better than imp currently. i wouldnt be surprised if the LDL players could perform better
[0:53:33] lhzc123456: yeah,only you .
[0:54:12] goblinguy01: Why would JDG even play with subpar imports? They really need a better jungler
[0:54:31] goblinguy01: Imp can be replaced with new ADC from LDL
[0:55:03] lhzc123456: they change the jungle yesterday.
[0:55:06] sqradi: i think it was homme who wanted to keep imp LUL bet he regrettin now

[1:22:12] 21044275: @tom4958 his advantage is shotcalling and utility
[1:22:26] puchue: now if y'all mind me I'm gonna ignore chat and watch the game

[2:42:22] Riccardo0609: and passive
[2:42:30] tsmfansaredelusional: not at all, TL is better than all LPL teams, and TSM/C9 could perhaps compete for 3-4th LPL teams

[2:46:35] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: TriHard 7
[2:46:41] fridaychill: People just don't watch lpl

[2:46:58] sunnyseason8: at least we get actions and lots of fights here
[2:47:09] joelferreira14: @tsmfansaredelusional Cn is in a good position to fight with Na, but TL can crush FPX anyway

[2:47:34] tsmfansaredelusional: @Sov25 yup, 3 koreans hard carry them at worlds, otherwise KT would win with another Korea title
[2:47:35] Sov25: @sunnyseason8 you get more action watching bums fight than the ufc LUL
[2:47:58] fridaychill: from what I see TL is gonna have a hard time against FPX
[2:48:06] xqf052: Na fans stop being delusional LUL
[2:48:07] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: these guys want action but theyre watching esports OMEGALUL
[2:48:32] joelferreira14: @KR_WORST_REGION TL will get finals at least
[2:48:34] sunnyseason8: I mean.... I guess you guys have a point
[2:48:36] Sov25: @kr_worst_region lpl best got stomped by na LUL
[2:49:02] kiyoeyoshioka: @Sov25 LPL best tilted against NA
[2:49:02] tsmfansaredelusional: TL would most likely beat FPX in a BO5... they had no trouble against IG whatsoever, they definitly wouldnt struggle against FPX
[2:49:23] Aenonarr: Chiefs from OPL will win Worlds.
[2:49:31] kiyoeyoshioka: Ning and Baolan inted harda f
[2:49:36] Sebkan1234: tell that to G2
[2:49:38] sunnyseason8: OCE will win worlds anyways
[2:49:42] 워누비: LCK >>> LPL

[2:49:49] joelferreira14: @tsmfansaredelusional 3x0 with TF Blade
[2:50:01] MagikLimbo: i watched two LCK games back to back a few days ago and both of them had 1 kill each at 17 minutes, it must be in their teams coaching manuals just to farm until then ResidentSleeper
[2:50:18] Aenonarr: OCE will win Worlds, make it a movement
[2:50:24] fridaychill: LCK can't adapt
[2:50:24] Aenonarr: #OCEWINWORLDS
[2:50:33] joelferreira14: Lck 30 min game = 2 kills ResidentSleeper Lpl 30 min game = 15 kills PogChamp
[2:50:40] fridaychill: it's just a fact that LCK doesn't want to change their style
[2:50:41] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: TFT > LEAGUE FAKTS BRUV
[2:51:20] joelferreira14: lck will die and na will eventually rise. Faker would fit perfect in my 100T
[2:51:22] Aenonarr: OPL 20 min game = 50 kills
[2:51:36] 워누비: LCK vs LPL = LCK win
[2:51:41] tsmfansaredelusional: what does it say about your region when a team that can go undefeated gets hard smashed by Korea's 4th place team
[2:51:57] fridaychill: Na hasn't risen ever really
[2:52:21] Aenonarr: Just let OCE win worlds.
[2:52:27] xqf052: NA has been rising for 8 years
[2:52:27] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: na obesity LUL eu teeth LUL
[2:52:27] fridaychill: ^
[2:52:59] fridaychill: bo1 never mattered
[2:53:19] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: yes 100T
[2:53:25] yolodonut: what does it say about your region when a team that couldn’t get to the finals of LPL destroys Korea’s number 1 team LUL
[2:53:38] tsmfansaredelusional: LPL won 1/8 games against LCK...you don't need to be a genius to see 1 region is much better than the other lol
[2:53:46] MagikLimbo: makes me wonder how LCK beat LPL at RR, looked like LPL teams went into those games playing the LCK ResidentSleeper slow and steady style instead of just going in super fast for some early kills
[2:54:10] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: ???????
[2:54:16] yolodonut: @dragoni888 yep
[2:54:21] BUZZ_LIGHTYEAR69: wtf theyre dsayi
[2:54:22] joelferreira14: RR means nothing. LCK will be crushed in Worlds
[2:54:48] fridaychill: What about doinb's pantheon play? @KR_WORST_REGION
[2:54:55] Yuki_Hozuki: Xiye pog
[2:55:06] Yuki_Hozuki: someone get Xiye out of WE pls :D
[2:55:09] Sov25: @kr_worst_region FPX is garbage
[2:55:12] tsmfansaredelusional: no patch advantage justifies the spanking your entire regions teams got in 90% of the games, they weren't even close. lol
[2:55:23] MagikLimbo: @KR_WORST_REGION yeh, i expected FPX would step up and be more dominant
[2:55:27] joelferreira14: @Yuki_Hozuki mystic too
[2:55:27] crosserat: when is g rex starting?
[2:55:43] Sov25: @kr_worst_region what about TOP LUL
[2:55:49] fridaychill: @KR_WORST_REGION Yeah I wouldn't say JDG and IG should be there too

[2:56:06] fridaychill: SKT really steped up though
[2:56:12] joelferreira14: ICON BEST CN PLAYER PogChamp
[2:56:16] fridaychill: they were looking terrible up until RR
[2:56:35] Archie4311: i guess IG had some excuses rookie was away from the team for quite a while
[2:56:41] xqf052: LPL falls behind and LCK has a better understanding of the patch. 3-1 losing to is actually acceptable. LCK is not that strong the 1st team is beaten by FPX.
[2:57:16] tsmfansaredelusional: the fact is, LPL got hard over rated by 1 worlds win by a single team, and them squeaking out a RR win in 5 close games. LS was right, the LPL still lacks basic fundamentals and discipline in there play
[2:57:19] Sov25: @xqf052 yes and lck 4th and 7th seed destroyed lpl best LUL makrle more excuses
[2:57:31] CombinedZeus: Lpl’s first stage games on 9,13 were at RR
[2:58:06] Sov25: @combinedzeus not lck fault that China needs government approval on LOL patches LUL
[2:58:12] yolodonut: LS Was right LUL good joke LUL
[2:58:16] Archie4311: arent people calling lec the strongest region just from msi lol people over react to everything
[2:58:19] tsmfansaredelusional: FPX got smashed by KZ, yes they beat griffin, but wouldn't call that looking strong lol
[2:58:40] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional teams complain every MSI about falling behind after attending MSI due to less time on current patch
[2:58:54] racokky1: hello chat
[2:58:56] xqf052: @Sov25 I agree Sov25 is currently the best region. But my points is that they re not unbeatable. Important factor of LPL losing is that they are behind of the current patch.
[2:58:56] CombinedZeus: Chinese government ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper na government cmonBruh cmonBruh EU government PogChamp PogChamp
[2:59:14] tsmfansaredelusional: he was right....go watch TL vs IG, he was right, LPL was overrated, and they lacked basics and discipline.
[2:59:17] Sov25: @combinedzeus EU banned memes LUL
[2:59:19] HystericsCasts: chat you crazy
[2:59:24] Archie4311: I wouldn't say any of the regions lpl lck and lec are going to win for sure they all have decent chances to do wwell
[2:59:59] joelferreira14: @HystericsCasts tell to these guys, 100t would smash Fpx in a bo5
[3:00:08] Archie4311: LUL
[3:00:20] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional Most games at MSI were 5 kills at max at 20 min, are you gonna act like you never watched LPL? Teams definitely had problems with the patch.
[3:00:21] Sov25: I remember ppl saying lpl is too fast for lck then they got spanked LUL
[3:00:28] dragoni888: I mean at RR
[3:00:41] fridaychill: @tsmfansaredelusional why are you here then if you clearly can't take any criticism?
[3:01:03] CombinedZeus: If lck and lpl are really better then NA then why haven’t they ever won an academy worlds LUL LUL
[3:01:33] Vens5: THESHYT LUL
[3:01:34] dragoni888: @Sov25 Most games at RR were 5 kills at max at 20 min, are you gonna act like you never watched LPL? Teams definitely had problems with the patch. SO what your point again?
[3:02:36] tsmfansaredelusional: man you guys are triggered.... fundamentals, strong communication, and most of all consistency is what wins championships. And the LPL has always struggled in this regard, outside of RNG at times. 9 years of professional league of legends is a testament to this. Stop being salty
[3:02:41] LePapaDeWakz: WHERE IS RAZ?
[3:03:01] Archie4311: so Doinb kinda went through what went wrong with RR he did say that teams were behind in patch
[3:03:04] dragoni888: Out side of RNG? Have you heard of OMG?
[3:03:09] fridaychill: I'm not salty I'm just debating and saying you're wrong
[3:03:14] dragoni888: Have you heard of Team WE?
[3:03:20] YamK_: As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after this game I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free.
[3:04:12] longxds: American is only 300 years history, so they are shallow, end of story
[3:04:41] fridaychill: Na fans are more delusional than I though geez
[3:04:43] tsmfansaredelusional: you guys can keep clinging to your narratives and "best players" or "mechanically talented" statements all you want, it hasn't done you any good this year or for 90% of league history
[3:04:51] will_o_will: Mexico is part of America
[3:05:09] Archie4311: so why are you hanging on to the past history of lck lol
[3:05:26] fridaychill: and Na for that matter ^
[3:05:37] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional maybe you should change your name to iamdelusiona;, OMG, TeamWE, EDG all have done well intertionally
[3:05:49] Damianbmth: Easy for IG or ?
[3:05:50] tsmfansaredelusional: LCK smashed LPL, NA smashed LPL, this happened just this year
[3:06:10] fridaychill: NA has played 1 bo5 against lpl
[3:06:43] longxds: hard to say now, but LCK is reviving
[3:06:54] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional Team WE beat GE tigers at IEM, upsets are meaningless especally when TL gets smashed in sub 25 min'
[3:07:15] xqf052: TL smashed IG does not mean NA smashed LPL.
[3:07:18] fridaychill: and litteraly every analyst says TL winning over IG was lucky
[3:07:25] CombinedZeus: Mfw 16 minute win means nothing
[3:07:40] bushtheteemo: TL plz
[3:07:55] Archie4311: like if your gonna count rift rivals then why not count lpl going 9-1 in groups of msi, both of those are bo1s are they not
[3:07:59] fridaychill: With his arguments we can say EU will smash Na at any point in time
[3:08:00] dragoni888: TL smashed IG, 3-1 one score line doesn't mean smash. IG threw 6k gold leads twice
[3:08:04] longxds: Not luck, LPL is going to a wrong way in spring and summer
[3:08:06] MagikLimbo: Faker makes one outplay, but SKT base was already broken by then...too little too late
[3:08:42] sagaggem: Hot af these guys
[3:08:46] tsmfansaredelusional: every analyst also said TheShy was the best player, IG was going to win MSI, LPL was better than LCK and would smash them, and all of those statements are straight up wrong, like you guys they cling to narratives lol
[3:08:51] longxds: LPL fell into battling all the time, falling behind in stragtage
[3:08:54] joelferreira14: ICON PogChamp PogChamp
[3:08:59] dragoni888: LPL is expanding too fast, G2 is just EU representative team
[3:09:11] xiaohan54321: Icon Kreygasm
[3:09:25] joelferreira14: I'm straight but Icon..
[3:09:32] fridaychill: @tsmfansaredelusional Can you make a real analytical conclusion? Then Eu is the best region in the world with your logic
[3:09:41] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional you obviously don't watch LPL reguarly it was already pointed out something went wrong with IG at MSI, jackeylove was there best player at MSI and RR
[3:09:44] Munchinsteaks: icon Transends sexualities
[3:09:55] Munchinsteaks: he's everyone's biggest crush
[3:10:16] CombinedZeus: @munchinsteaks Icon is my sexuality

[3:11:01] vampfuI: cringe NotLikeThis
[3:11:15] fridaychill: @tsmfansaredelusional all you're stating is win% something even your LS said isn't 100% equivelent to how good you are
[3:11:40] fridaychill: you're not making any analysis
[3:11:53] tsmfansaredelusional: it's irrelevant why they lost, we can go back in history and start excusing every teams loss to because of X and Y. Fact is they lost, and LPL loses a lot
[3:12:03] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional TL being done 6k gold is harder to fix than IG randomly throwing the game.
[3:12:08] Archie4311: oh now we going back to history
[3:12:13] bushtheteemo: omfg
[3:12:16] joelferreira14: jackeylove cmonBruh
[3:12:36] fridaychill: @tsmfansaredelusional I want to debate you for real give me your discord handle
[3:12:41] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional Yeah we lost, we lost in 2015 worlds and 2017 MSI, did it change anything?
[3:12:59] tsmfansaredelusional: good for IG then, I look forward to them fixing that issue, but they still got smashed by TL lol
[3:13:23] joelferreira14: TL prob best team in the world rn
[3:13:25] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional how did they smashed when they inted in winning positions
[3:13:29] vampfuI: imagine thinking NA LCS is better than IG and LPL LUL
[3:13:42] Archie4311: do g2 best team in the world cuz they smashed skt too
[3:13:47] Archie4311: so*
[3:13:54] fridaychill: Imagine thinking NA is better than Eu after rift rivals LUL
[3:14:06] vampfuI: ^ LUL
[3:14:08] bushtheteemo: TL might beat Excel in bo5 LUL
[3:14:22] vampfuI: @kr_worst_region facts
[3:14:34] tsmfansaredelusional: @dragoni888 because smash is a smash, doesn't matter why or how
[3:14:39] Archie4311: Tl aint that bad they might take a few games here and there
[3:14:55] fridaychill: TL might take games yes, but win no
[3:15:27] vampfuI: NA has no chance at an international tournament skill gap is too high
[3:15:28] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional no Smash is when you look up in the dictionary and the TL vs G2 game is the definition of getting smashed
[3:15:29] CombinedZeus: TL might make it out of play ins
[3:15:33] tsmfansaredelusional: just like TL might take a game against IG but lose
[3:15:45] xqf052: TL was smashed by EU teams and LCK teams so I dont think TL can make out of group in the world LUL

[3:16:14] tsmfansaredelusional: @dragoni888 but TL inted in winning positions, that is not a smash

[3:20:40] fridaychill: You're just forcing a narritive that's skewed since you don't want to change your own stance even
[3:21:02] xqf052: @tsmfansaredelusional If we can accept LPL is currently worse than LCK. Why cant you accept IG was better than anyone in the 2018 world?
[3:21:12] CombinedZeus: This draft ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:21:28] Vens5: LETS GO OMG
[3:21:30] tsmfansaredelusional: @xqf052 i do accept IG was better, that is why they won...

[3:21:50] bushtheteemo: I want to see worlds before I am convinced that LCK > LPL
[3:21:51] Jlukke: who won draft
[3:21:52] Archie4311: @tsmfansaredelusional so i just went through the match history of kt vs ig in worlds 2018, only one game did kt have a 2k gold lead early
[3:22:04] Quasar_421: I'm excited to fpx worlds
[3:22:14] vicviper: forge got them 3 wins and is back to bench BibleThump
[3:22:15] CombinedZeus: Doinb ruined the lpl
[3:22:25] Archie4311: so i dont think any of it were throws from kt
[3:22:27] CombinedZeus: Every other draft is boring
[3:22:30] katra_zeall: @dragoni888 if he's trolling, then accept the fact that you won the debate and move on
[3:22:35] tsmfansaredelusional: what is your definition of early? why is only early relevant? are you really going to pull out 1 arbitraty stat lol
[3:22:38] fridaychill: if anything Doinb is the lpl
[3:22:44] yudai95: @katra_zeall wtf no, dont tell him that
[3:22:50] yudai95: @dragoni888 keep debatin him
[3:22:52] MagikLimbo: @CombinedZeus could be worse, least it's not on the ResidentSleeper Ezreal Sona Taric Tahm patch

[3:23:27] Archie4311: out of the 3 games ig won against kt, the only game kt had a gold lead was a 2k gold lead at 16m
[3:23:41] fridaychill: @tsmfansaredelusional you're only pulling out winrate that's not good either for this debate. you're pulling up stats from years ago when you want to talk about these years. maybe make good sense of your arguments first then debate this
[3:23:46] 汶汶熊: GivePLZ
[3:23:46] LePapaDeWakz: Wutface

[3:24:36] fridaychill: @tsmfansaredelusional it's not worth having this talk if we aren't looking at the games 1 by 1
[3:24:39] Miller57: damn even shy is abusing karma top
[3:24:44] lipsnlegs: icon losing cause his skin
[3:25:06] CombinedZeus: Imagine not banning jayce against rookie and theshy
[3:25:36] yudai95: fridaychill is curently winning the debate, with a close second place to tsmfansaredelusional, and well dragoni is last place atm, will dragoni make an epic comeback?
[3:25:56] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional in 2017 Team We lost to G2 at MSI. Do you wanna know who did better at worlds?
[3:26:01] OneSn1pe: and akali @CombinedZeus
[3:26:20] Miller57: "we"
[3:26:37] fridaychill: I try and follow every major region this year
[3:26:47] tsmfansaredelusional: @dragoni888 why are you bringing up win rates from past years? @fridaychill just said that is a bad argument LUL
[3:26:57] fridaychill: If anything I feel more qualified to talk about this than you
[3:27:17] yudai95: OOOF and tsmfansaredelusonal comes to deny dragoni's argument with facts and logic
[3:27:37] carlosedupereira0: AATROS JG META
[3:27:37] Miller57: 100T will win worlds :)
[3:27:50] tsmfansaredelusional: i have been using facts and logic this entire time, he is just so blinded by his passion for LPL LUL
[3:27:56] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional because history repeats it self
[3:28:14] yudai95: ?
[3:28:23] Archie4311: wait you feel like the person being super passionate about lck
[3:28:32] tsmfansaredelusional: @dragoni888 so history repeats it self when LPL wins but it doesn't when LCK won everything for 5 years? LUL
[3:28:33] fridaychill: I'm not passionate for lpl, I'm more passionate over Eu. I can agree LCK looked insane at might be one of the best regions
[3:28:42] xiaohan54321: Naut LUL
[3:28:46] vicviper: WutFace omg wtf
[3:28:46] joelferreira14: @Miller57 I totally agree. Prob a 3-1 vs Skt or Fpx in finals
[3:29:02] fridaychill: But I also think LPL is one of the better regions of the world as well
[3:29:06] dragoni888: @tsmfansaredelusional LCK can come back, no one LCK can't come bacck
[3:29:08] birmz_aaron_is_a_weeb: LPL 4th best region now SuperVinlin
[3:29:21] yudai95: @tsmfansaredelusional ooof friday just confessed hes an EU fanboy, u cant let that go through,, u must stop him

[3:31:05] 21044275: holy shit get this man on a different champ for once
[3:31:10] fridaychill: I'm agreeing LCK is really good I don't agree on the TL and Na part @tsmfansaredelusional
[3:31:13] xqf052: If IG can come back with its strongest form. I hope they can join FPX and RNG representing LPL in the world.
[3:31:14] xiaohan54321: and draven
