[1:24:44] 21044275: I wish riot would just remove TP already, when aggressive high skill champs like Irelia don't take ignite, it hurts the game

[1:28:30] Kxmx_Rin: No ban phases anymore, just random champs every game even in Ranked Keepo
[1:28:33] bushtheteemo: I was thinking of stopwatch as well. It would increase the bloodiness, but Im not sure the play would be better.
[1:28:51] bushtheteemo: LCS already have NARAM :)
[1:28:52] 21044275: knight and 369 are the most overrated players of all time, while xx seems like a choker

[1:29:15] 21044275: he got smashed by faker

[1:29:43] sqradi: knight is good though just can't 1v9 every game
[1:29:50] 21044275: xiaohu and xiye both solo killed faker in his prime, knight got smashed by a washed up faker
[1:30:36] 21044275: xiye destroyed faker with lucian, xiaohu destroyed faker with leblanc
[1:30:45] thxnic: I heard that there is a contradiction between Xx and 369.

[1:36:02] 21044275: no, caps has proven himself by getting to worlds finals and winning msi + LEC, worlds different from knight
[1:36:05] dragaao: being overrated doesnt mean u have to actually say they are a choker, ppl put too many expectations on a 19 yr old boy who is playing his second split on lpl on one of the best teams

[1:43:54] carryme40: IT WOULD BE WEIRD THE DEFENDING CHAMPION DONT MAKE IT TO WORLDS
[1:43:57] YSZN: ig has been looking sketchy be it theshy, ning and baolan. Then we don't know where rookie is mentally
[1:44:16] yudai95: IG lost to best team in the west
[1:44:30] Heyz3r: Kappa
[1:44:30] 21044275: right now FPX and RNG are the 2 best team in lpl, and LNG is just a wildcard that can do well
[1:44:31] yudai95: Kappa
[1:44:34] sqradi: @carryme40 is ur caps lock key broken?
[1:44:38] carryme40: best team in the west would lose to any of the top 5 teams in lpl

[1:45:10] suber3: @carryme40 and any top 5 lpl will lose to kz lol
[1:45:11] carryme40: IG choked, TL is not that good
[1:45:15] yudai95: i thought RNG only played vs bad teams atm adn thats why they look good?
[1:45:15] YSZN: And I really dislike the comment theshy made with "toplane doesn't matter" so he feels his deaths are fine and he justifies bad performances. I couldn't see faker or other elite players make such statements
[1:45:18] kutoriiii: lng overrated
[1:45:28] basement111: adc is sht atm so uzi probably can't carry RNG to worlds

[1:48:02] kayonas: i think that most league spectators are dumb and dont realize its a gold based game and anyone can win

[3:05:15] carryme40: ming is top 3 , but he has competition
[3:05:25] FriedBaozi: @Nibiria not sure if you're just trolling along LUL
[3:05:28] kinghanamaru: G2 bot >RNG bot >>>all

[3:05:35] YSZN: lol andy...
[3:05:39] fakerismyfriend: VIRGIN CHECK monkaS 👉 pokiW I’m safe PogChamp
[3:05:56] 도정잉: RNG couldn't even show up in RiftRivals...
[3:06:12] Yolo_pete: @Nibiria One can dream though FeelsBadMan
[3:06:16] Nibiria: @FriedBaozi i mean is there anything in that that's wrong? i think it's dumb to assume imports solve everything
[3:06:18] sqradi: to be fair RNG was 4v5 the whole spring split
[3:06:19] carryme40: rng would had won rift rivals. they never lost a rift rivals yet.
[3:06:26] Nibiria: and importing a player that doesn't speak the language will drop their relative performance
[3:06:53] carryme40: rng + amazingj was so sad to watch. he was getting killed in top lane :(
[3:06:56] Yolo_pete: But LPL has some Korean imports 🤔
[3:07:08] Nibiria: right and the ones that are successful haven't always started successful
[3:07:08] sqradi: karsa even cried on stage because of how heavy amazingj was LUL
[3:07:14] 도정잉: UZI vs JackeyLove who do u guys think is the best ADC in LPL?
[3:07:15] 21044275: you wonder why rng even signed amazingj in the first place
[3:07:35] 21044275: how can a player as bad as amazingj even get on a team, let alone a top team
[3:07:37] Red_The_Legendary_trainer: LNG will win worlds DogFace
[3:07:41] flamazide: why do you guys even want to keep importing players? you JUST saw LDL players perform well.
[3:07:46] 21044275: amazingj wouldn't make any starting roster even in NA
[3:07:51] FriedBaozi: RNG signed amazingJ because letme was retiring and AJ was the only free agent
[3:07:53] perfectrotation7: when is champ select holy shit
[3:07:57] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: DogFace
[3:08:09] svens_ex_boyfriend: JKL is rly overrated he’s pretty much a kaisa one trick mediocre to bad on other champions
[3:08:20] carryme40: uzi > jackielove because uzi is the best or second best player (karsa), while jackielove is not even the third best player on his team (ning)
[3:08:51] Yolo_pete: JKL has a good xayah performance too
[3:08:57] carryme40: hell, i would say baolan is better than jackielove
[3:08:58] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Not true. Jackey is literally a better version of Uzi. Jackey can play a very good xayah, lucian, kaisa, draven etc.. He is the most insane play i have ever seen in LoL pro play. I would say for me he surpasses Faker status.
[3:08:58] 도정잉: But IG has Worlds title
[3:09:14] carryme40: in fact, I CAN ARGUE JACKIELOVE IS THE WORST PLAYER ON HIS TEAM
[3:09:26] Rudiko: @carryme40 youre actually trolling
[3:09:30] yudai95: Not true. Jackey is literally a better version of Uzi. Jackey can play a very good xayah, lucian, kaisa, draven etc.. He is the most insane play i have ever seen in LoL pro play. I would say for me he surpasses Faker status.
[3:09:45] 도정잉: That's because IG has very good top and mid laners

[3:10:48] 도정잉: in current form, LNG vs EDG?
[3:10:50] wlwhs103: LUL
[3:10:51] yudai95: twitch chat, i have a serious question
[3:10:53] carryme40: rng last game = uzi on vayne. is all the proof i need. uzi > jackielove.
[3:10:55] 도정잉: I don't really watch LPL
[3:11:02] yudai95: is LNG actually good, or are they just a meme?
[3:11:03] will_o_will: i can play that leg allday
[3:11:05] Ketaknaller: 182 isn't that tall
[3:11:06] darkblade83: LNG will have a slight edge

[3:11:08] aesf107: PLEX PogChamp
[3:11:10] Yolo_pete: TheShy is quite tall too
[3:11:14] svens_ex_boyfriend: @yolo_pete that xayah performance was not so good except that flash
[3:11:15] 21044275: @yudai95 this game is the ultimate test for LNG
[3:11:20] sqradi: LNG is pretty good now
[3:11:22] WorthJunglerEU: uzi < jackeylove / Uzi < autofill any pro as adc LUL
[3:11:24] Clement_LoL: Ning is even taller
[3:11:26] 21044275: @yudai95 this game decides if LNG is a top team or a meme
[3:11:28] perfectrotation7: ive never seen a tall asian before
[3:11:42] yudai95: @21044275 EDG will trytheir best to throw for them
[3:11:51] Clement_LoL: legend has it that taller junglers can look over walls and into brushes, it is a large advantage
[3:11:54] sqradi: you've never seen yao ming?
[3:11:58] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Its sad that LPL were patches behind vs LCK at RR and sent JDG instead of RNG :( Would have been a completely different story.
[3:11:59] 21044275: tbh, young generation Chinese nowadays are much taller than before
[3:12:00] unclearhate: Watch EDG make worlds again to disappoint LUL
[3:12:02] FriedBaozi: jeremy lin?
[3:12:03] will_o_will: Laker
[3:12:04] TeemoDoinHisjob: what is the point been tall they sit and play video games all day anyway
[3:12:16] carryme40: i think edg will win, worlds is coming, and edg never missed a world yet.
[3:12:17] will_o_will: LAKERS FOR THE WIN
[3:12:20] 도정잉: Why do LPL ADCs love Kaisa so much... LCK adcs don't pick it
[3:12:31] bokoraxe: I think SirNukesALot is the tallest pro player with over 2 meters
[3:12:37] 21044275: my nephew is 13 years old and already 175cm
[3:12:39] Clement_LoL: @wassuuuupamigo ask the GFs, being tall is like god's gift QQ
[3:12:41] carryme40: lck adcs dont have the mechanical skills tp lay kaisa
[3:12:54] 21044275: my nephew is taller than me
[3:12:55] Nibiria: ig's coach is 193cm i think he's the tallest person in LPL
[3:12:57] Yolo_pete: @svens_ex_boyfriend There was one other game where iG was behind but JL was basically 1v4 and managed to keep themselves in the game and won eventually

[3:13:11] mattaru: does SOFM speak mandarin?
[3:13:27] 21044275: @mattaru yeah hes fluent by now
[3:13:37] YSZN: ive heard rumor sofm is fluent in mandarin and also english
[3:13:39] svens_ex_boyfriend: @dowonking because she requires little mechanics but good instincts which lpl players normally have due to high frequency of fights
[3:13:42] aesf107: TriHard 7
[3:13:43] carryme40: lpl = 16 teams = only 3 world spots , while lck, na, eu = 10 teams = 3 world spots...... this feel wrong....
[3:13:53] yudai95: CMON MODS LET MY COMMENT GO THROUGH IT WASNT MEAN
[3:13:59] mattaru: @thisisdedication english! getting ready for the NA Retirement money as TSM_SOFM
[3:14:07] darkblade83: @thisisdedication not as so as fluent but he can communicate without any problem
[3:14:08] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I think TSM showed something yesterday and it was progress. If they keep improving at this pace i think at worlds time they will be a threat at worlds. I would say their roster at full potential is a world champion team caliber.. they just need to figure that out. Zven is a very hardworking player and Bjergsen is the perfect tool to help them out.

[3:14:50] carryme40: doublelift is chinese...

I would say their roster at full potential is a world champion team caliber.. they just need to figure that out. Ryu is a very hardworking player and Aphroo is the perfect tool to help them out.
[3:15:05] yudai95: LEC ONLY HAS G2 LUL
[3:15:06] carryme40: they dont import chinese because they already have chinese
[3:15:08] 21044275: Doublelift is Chinese but he can't speak Chinese that's hilarious
[3:15:10] Yolo_pete: But hes from NA.....
[3:15:18] YSZN: i want sofm to stay on lng, why leave when they finally get good and the org has money to spend
[3:15:19] Nibiria: @21044275 because they make a ton in china and why would they leave for NA when they have similar earning potential and won't have to adjust to a new culture and learn a brand new language
[3:15:20] TeemoDoinHisjob: doublelift is ABC
[3:15:20] LmaoLp: LPL, aka " L U L PL," is a league for Riot China that is praised for its fast, but nonsensical and low IQ plays. It is specifically known for cherishing their lone world championship and thinking they are the best in the world...
[3:15:25] Nibiria: also doublelift can speak some chinese

[3:20:26] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I wouldn't say DL is the best adc in the world but for sure a top 2-4 adc in the world. I think the only adc above DL is Uma Jan. i mean.. the difference between the 2 is that Uma jan just has a much better xayah.
[3:20:29] yudai95: @epamynondas_ ely
[3:20:30] Red_The_Legendary_trainer: DL best ADC? SoBayed

[3:21:23] vicviper: LUL until he removes mental barrier against Uzi he doesn't even has a spot in top 3
[3:21:34] shaarawytruong: U forgot V1per, Teddy, JackeyLove, Uzi, Rekkness
[3:21:38] carryme40: doublelift won 6 titles on 3 different teams, he reached msi finals. he is a top 3 adc in the world, don't blame him because he play in na
[3:21:58] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: V1per and Teddy are good but nothing special.

I would say their roster at full potential is a world champion team caliber.. they just need to figure that out. Zven is a very hardworking player and Bjergsen is the perfect tool to help them out.

[3:29:15] myhemcph: will be so ez for edg
[3:29:18] mushenfanboy: @kinghanamaru Im a SKT/Bang fan but even then I dont put Bang as the best ADC :/
[3:29:20] sqradi: @benthecitizen wait.. he didnt expect NA support to be leagues below LCK supports? LUL
[3:29:29] yudai95: nemesis said TL would be top 4 or top 5 in LEC, do u agree chat?
[3:29:32] thecat_meow1: doublelift = doubletits .. worst adc in the history of adc
[3:29:53] dragoni888: @carryme40 DL is not top 3, Jackeylove beat him at MSI and jackeylove ins't even top 3, check MSI stats, bot 2 adc
[3:30:08] 21044275: jayce would be balanced if they removed his hammer knockback

[3:30:24] yudai95: rush hour Pog
[3:30:25] LmaoLp: LPL, aka " L U L PL," is a league for Riot China that is praised for its fast, but nonsensical and low IQ plays. It is specifically known for cherishing their lone world championship and thinking they are the best in the world...
[3:30:39] bloodyboii34: i see edg winning this
[3:30:51] dragoni888: @carryme40 DL did nothing and imapct made the game changing plays
[3:30:51] carryme40: jackeylove isn't a top 3 adc , i agree, good thing doublelift beat him then
[3:30:54] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: NA has been a dominant region this last years... 1-2 quarter finals appearances at worlds, 1 semis and now 1 MSI final. Unlucky they always had to face the best region in the world (EU) or they would have advanced further. This is the year, the year everyone sees NA as the 2nd best region in the world.
[3:30:59] demiurggermanec247: 1 ON 1 PogChamp

[3:31:38] carryme40: it is a team effort, doublelift team won, jackeylove team lost. u dont get credit for losing
[3:31:41] sqradi: @temptsau OMEGALUL
[3:31:42] vicviper: LUL NA 2nd best with no MSI or worlds champion?
[3:31:49] Yolo_pete: And EU won rift rivals 2018 and 2019
[3:31:49] dragoni888: @carryme40 DL has bottom 2 adc stats at MSI fact. Impact carried TL, and IG inted more than TL played well, two times throwing baron buff and 6k gold lead

[3:33:21] yudai95: S OMEGALUL FM
[3:33:24] dragoni888: @carryme40 DL is one of the worst team fighting adc's in the world. The lane is his entire carrer
[3:33:26] thecat_meow1: even the worst chines team got a 2nd spot
[3:33:30] buddhaisbetter420: Sofm LULW

[3:33:36] sma55ive: yeah my gradpa told me about lmq
[3:33:48] mushenfanboy: @roqtt But the reason I am pretty convinced is because in that one game when 100T vsed FLY Bang had no idea what Aphromoo was doing
[3:33:57] carryme40: you can't say you are the better adc if your team lost. sorry jackeylove fanboys. but doublelift is better.
[3:34:10] mushenfanboy: Bruh
[3:34:16] mushenfanboy: The best ADC can be debatable

[3:35:28] Red_The_Legendary_trainer: jk never won MSI LUL he won Worlds
[3:35:32] dragoni888: @carryme40 LUL Messi not the best footballer in the world cause he can't win World Cup. Better team on the day one. Corejj and Impact did all the work
[3:35:34] carryme40: true, but if you win msi, that still counts
[3:35:35] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I think 100T showed something yesterday and it was progress. If they keep improving at this pace i think at worlds time they will be a threat at worlds. I would say their roster at full potential is a world champion team caliber.. they just need to figure that out. Bang is a very hardworking player and Ryu is the perfect tool to help them out.

[3:37:28] carryme40: he got out of groups at msi. that counts
[3:37:33] sma55ive: all other competitions are a joke
[3:37:40] mushenfanboy: Not saying Jackeylove is trash but for a world champion to lose to a underdog says something
[3:37:46] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I think XL showed something yesterday and it was progress. If they keep improving at this pace i think at worlds time they will be a threat at worlds. I would say their roster at full potential is a world champion team caliber.. they just need to figure that out. Inspired is a very hardworking player and Mickey is the perfect tool to help them out.
[3:37:50] dragoni888: @BentheCitizen team winning means DL didn't perform like a bottom tier adc. IG lost cause ning and baolan inted

[3:38:51] dragoni888: @BentheCitizen DL had bottom two stats at MSI. That JKL was more consistent and a better adc
[3:39:00] mushenfanboy: @onsesentchanceux You say his team doesn't play well but there is a reason why they're world champions you know....

[3:40:45] dragoni888: @carryme40 you are right all that matter is you win. JKL has won more than DL be quiet when you talk about some worthless adc that hasn't gotten out of worlds in 8 years

[3:41:55] yudai95: apparently NA is going to invade area 51
[3:41:58] mushenfanboy: @onsesentchanceux If they're monstrous last year why aren't they this year? If it worked last year then it should work this year until they figure something out for a counterplay.

[3:58:48] YSZN: i saw he reached as high as 3, but him getting rank 1 again is pretty impressive
[3:59:25] carryme40: now, before edg fanboys get too excited... remember that scout giveth and scout can taketh. brace yourself.... scout is due for a bad game.
[3:59:26] YSZN: @darkblade83 his champion pool looks improved as well, I want to say he only played kalista and varus the first rank 1
[4:00:05] LePapaDeWakz: LPL > LCK
[4:00:07] darkblade83: @thisisdedication problem w light is still mentality he needs stage time but i guess LNG wont bet on that until they start losing more

[4:14:37] sqradi: raz is a closet serial killer
[4:15:24] flamazide: well, there are different forms of rhyming though
[4:15:28] YSZN: i could see someone using zoe and yuumi as a rhyme, but i probably wouldn't
[4:16:04] YSZN: one of those things of coulds and shoulds
[4:16:39] flamazide: it depends on the type of rhyme we're talking
[4:17:27] flamazide: its like...assonance i think technically, which is also a rhyme. its like if you say a simile is a metaphor i guess
[4:17:42] demiurggermanec247: KARTHUS BAN LUL
[4:17:44] flamazide: so raz gets by strictly on technicality!
[4:17:45] YSZN: it seems like one of those things where the rapper would put an emphasis on the on the e to make sure it really lands, but its kind of a stretch
[4:17:46] Ketaknaller: LS 4Head

[4:18:55] YSZN: are you doing the chris delia eminem thing when you say you could make those rhyme
[4:19:10] YSZN: where you are doing the absolute most to make it rhyme by mispronouncing
[4:19:32] flamazide: the issue really is that YOU ME and ZOE E dont have the same sounds starting out ruining the case if it rhyming. lol but yes to your second point
