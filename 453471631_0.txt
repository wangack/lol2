[2:55:41] Sov25: @itzMaeiv They play a reactive play style and eventually have reginald undermine the system they have in place. Once reginald said that the players have the same power as the coaches, that's when I knew TSM was going to remain garbage.
[2:55:46] ktkmsama: @nwpulverizer UZI is the best chinese AD of all time no doubt

[5:17:17] groonin: will do
[5:17:29] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Jesper6739 cause the english broadcast has to walk after the chinese broadcast which is sad
[5:17:34] AnOldDinosaur: Being an lpl mod must be fun LUL
[5:17:48] scottoflorida2014: @AnOldDinosaur They have their work cut out for them

[5:18:00] salada_fria: new akali? 35% wr in soloq, 90%+ on competitive
[5:18:32] CertainlySomeoneHere: @Jesper6739 yep, that makes it hard for the english broadcast to keep their audience that consists of betters too. Which is why I try to keep people here cause I think it's really sad for the english cast

[5:19:22] Worst205: gg olaf
[5:19:33] CertainlySomeoneHere: Also LPL mods have no work cut out for them? The currently only active mod is @Nibiria , a caster. The rest of the mods that aren't casters aren't here too often and are act ually experienced mods you see on a lot of other twitch channels
[5:19:58] scottoflorida2014: Raz is here sometimes modding
[5:20:10] pr3yanimal: Qiyana’s enchanted attacks do some AP.
[5:20:13] ghostedsn1: ***
[5:20:15] scottoflorida2014: and Hysteria keeps it clean
[5:20:16] salada_fria: I mean, 5k viewers, no one really cares for LPL outside China
[5:20:45] Sing3d: Crtvly mods here sometimes
[5:20:54] scottoflorida2014: ^^
[5:20:58] satatardy: LPL has great teams just the English broadcast is pretty low quality
[5:21:00] Drekt: I mean, most people are working or sleeping while LPL is on and today isn't a good day in terms of teams.
[5:21:04] satatardy: Compared to every other major region
[5:21:20] scottoflorida2014: LPL chat is just so much more mature, no need for mods watching everything
[5:21:30] Sing3d: And Yeah I remember the old LPL ghetto stream :)
[5:21:42] Nibiria: based on some of the things i've banned for, that's debatable @scottofl2014
[5:21:45] Nibiria: but probably generally true

[5:22:03] scottoflorida2014: @Nibiria uh oh Mod watching OOPS :O
[5:22:04] satatardy: sounyuumaru the overall production quality is much better and I don't think most people would agree that there's only 1 good caster
[5:22:14] Mechafanboy: LPL is generally slower, wouldn't really say it's more/less mature. Will say there's less cringy meme copypasta though.
[5:22:26] scottoflorida2014: I mean I havent seen like the spam as bad as other regions in this chat in all the years its been around
[5:22:29] Nibiria: we have a lot of automated moderation

[5:22:54] AnOldDinosaur: lol chat is usually just banter about one region being better than the other. EU this NA that SeemsGood

[5:24:48] scottoflorida2014: @marianacard0so End of September I believe
[5:24:48] GeNoFPaniC: LPL has good playes but they just arent on the same level with other regions yet

[5:25:12] CertainlySomeoneHere: @GeNoFPaniC how come? They did become world champions thouguh
[5:25:16] satatardy: LPL has so many insanely good players like it's crazy how when Rookie wasn't available IG's sub midlaner just comes out and plays like a god (in some games) as well
[5:25:23] Sing3d: Worlds start October 2nd

[5:25:38] marianacard0so: @sing3d thank you
[5:25:47] therzonz: 2nd october? Shouldn't it be late summer, like august?

[5:25:50] salada_fria: I mean, they can easily beat KR
[5:25:51] NaraKaiden: wjp won blg vs jdg
[5:25:53] cope_enjoyer: @scottofl2014 didn't watch last worlds?

[5:27:24] scottoflorida2014: I missed EU or NA winning Worlds last year ? Hmmm
[5:27:26] CertainlySomeoneHere: @GeNoFPaniC never said so. I'm only saying, LPL has teams that are on the level of other regions
[5:27:31] doubledeeees: where can I see this live?

[5:28:05] satatardy: filho_do_daciolo I don't think so though, but I guess it's not something you can know for sure
[5:28:08] 21044275: They have the 2 top teams in the world in G2 and Fnatic
[5:28:23] sma55ive: nah LPL is better
