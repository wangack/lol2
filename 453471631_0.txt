[2:55:41] Sov25: @itzMaeiv They play a reactive play style and eventually have reginald undermine the system they have in place. Once reginald said that the players have the same power as the coaches, that's when I knew TSM was going to remain garbage.
[2:55:46] ktkmsama: @nwpulverizer UZI is the best chinese AD of all time no doubt

[5:20:58] satatardy: LPL has great teams just the English broadcast is pretty low quality

[5:21:04] satatardy: Compared to every other major region
[5:21:20] scottoflorida2014: LPL chat is just so much more mature, no need for mods watching everything

[5:22:04] satatardy: sounyuumaru the overall production quality is much better and I don't think most people would agree that there's only 1 good caster
[5:22:14] Mechafanboy: LPL is generally slower, wouldn't really say it's more/less mature. Will say there's less cringy meme copypasta though.
[5:22:26] scottoflorida2014: I mean I havent seen like the spam as bad as other regions in this chat in all the years its been around

[5:27:24] scottoflorida2014: I missed EU or NA winning Worlds last year ? Hmmm
[5:27:26] CertainlySomeoneHere: @GeNoFPaniC never said so. I'm only saying, LPL has teams that are on the level of other regions
[5:27:31] doubledeeees: where can I see this live?
[5:27:38] satatardy: filho_do_daciolo I know those are only the top 3 teams but I don't see why you'd think eu bottom teams are worse than na bottom
[5:27:39] Sing3d: EU is really strong nowadays
[5:27:41] salada_fria: @satatardy lul u didnt get what I said... average games in NA are better than in EU, but EU has a better top 3

[5:28:05] satatardy: filho_do_daciolo I don't think so though, but I guess it's not something you can know for sure
[5:28:08] 21044275: They have the 2 top teams in the world in G2 and Fnatic
