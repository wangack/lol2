[1:42:34] YSZN: @nindoges one lucky thing for IG though is the champion points wasted on JDG who I doubt will reach the level of play last playoffs. The playoff bracket will likely force LNG or EDG out of regional due to difficult of schedule on one side

[3:30:03] TankOfLobsters: what patch is this on
[3:30:11] Corbulo4: @alucarddhs its more like that and they know the market is HUGE AF... like millions/billions so they are looking at long term communist pocket and influence

[3:30:46] haxxBase: was karma banned?
[3:30:46] Nibiria: chinese side has 2 studios
[3:30:46] mnsapobvfdiu: this game was sh*t for fast click weebs from the start, the hype is dying LUL
[3:30:48] Nibiria: and 2 caster teams
[3:30:55] s2Arsenal69: old mid vs new mid LNG monkaS
[3:31:07] Nibiria: so when the second series is started in the second venue they start right on time
[3:31:17] Nibiria: we don't have the same luxury so second series will sometimes be delayed
[3:31:28] storegitte: @kr_worst_region I was getting a bit nervous there....
[3:31:34] YSZN: @Nibiria does lng ever play at shanghai or are they only at their location and other franchised locations?
[3:31:46] DonEladio: @mnsapobvfdiu, game is already dead, the millions active players are all bots Kappa
[3:31:54] alucarddhs: so its basically because of the time delay / maximise viewer ship internationally
[3:31:59] Nibiria: @thisisdedication general rule of thumb is if a team owns a venue they will always be at either that or another team-owned venue and never the central shanghai one
[3:32:03] alucarddhs: in other words, money : D
