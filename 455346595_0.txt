[1:06:14] lipsnlegs: RNG about to serve EDG the D
[1:06:18] 21044275: Smlz is one of the most overrated players of all time
[1:06:47] lipsnlegs: Smlz got fake lips
[1:07:09] Zencent: EDG JIA YOU!!
[1:07:20] 21044275: yes, smlz is trash
[1:07:32] sqradi: would be sad if RNG doesnt make worlds i feel like uzi will retire soon FeelsBadMan
[1:07:48] Zencent: RNG will make worlds
[1:08:02] 21044275: @roqtt do you see the competition in lpl lmao, who can even challenge RNG for a spot at worlds
[1:08:13] 21044275: FPX and RNG are the clear top 2 teams
[1:08:31] Zencent: Royal. Never. Give up. RNG will be at worlds and Uzi will win a worlds, its fate.
[1:08:36] lipsnlegs: @KR_WORST_REGION He'd either retire or stay and bank promotion checks for a couple more years
[1:09:16] Zencent: Fpx, Rng, iG will be the 3 chinese teams at worlds
[1:09:28] 21044275: IG won't be at worlds lmao
[1:09:31] lipsnlegs: ig wont make it
[1:09:38] 21044275: it will be top, lng or edg
[1:09:39] spook1313_: EDG at worlds Pog
[1:09:48] Zencent: they got first in spring. points matter
[1:09:50] lipsnlegs: Itl; be TOP FPX RNG or FPX RNG EDG
[1:09:52] 21044275: ig is way too garbage to make worlds this year
[1:10:08] Zencent: EDG is my favorite team
[1:10:12] widepeepoHappy_Clap: rng over rated
[1:10:15] lipsnlegs: no one cares
[1:10:28] 21044275: wait is angel playing top lane?
[1:10:34] 21044275: wtf
[1:10:43] Zencent: but I believe iG will make worlds pretty easily
[1:10:56] lhzc123456: like v5
[1:11:13] sqradi: IG going to humiliate themselves if they make worlds
[1:11:20] lipsnlegs: So sad about Mlxgs retirement only fun jungler to watch now, tbh rng isnt even fun to watch with karsa hes so boring
[1:11:22] 21044275: @zencent IG making it to worlds is terrible for LPL
[1:11:28] Zencent: teams that get first in spring almost always go to worlds.
[1:11:51] Zencent: heck even teams that get 2nd in spring go to worlds often.
[1:11:52] 21044275: skt isn't making it to worlds if they don't get playoffs
[1:11:56] spook1313_: maybe ig recovers?
[1:12:08] lipsnlegs: iG is mental boom rn
[1:12:10] BaldursDottir: Angel<3
[1:12:15] sqradi: so much drama happening in IG
[1:12:18] lipsnlegs: if they can comeback yeah they can
[1:12:23] Zencent: surprisingly skt is the closest to making that come true
[1:12:43] 21044275: I hopt ig and skt don't make it to worlds so we have actual strong teams from lpl and lck
[1:12:50] BaldursDottir: me<
[1:12:50] Zencent: a team to win spring then not make worlds
[1:12:56] 21044275: ig is utter garbage and skt isn't a top team in korea
[1:13:02] xqf052: RNG looks better than IG though after Langxing joining the team.
[1:13:19] spook1313_: what is the IG score atm?
[1:13:27] lipsnlegs: FPX wont win worlds, RNG might but we are looking at another strong strong korean performance id say we seeing 2 korean 1 chinese and g2 in semis at worlds
[1:13:28] janiop1231: ?
[1:13:38] sqradi: @KR_WORST_REGION dying on the inside :)
[1:13:44] Zencent: G2 is a very strong bet to win worlds
[1:13:51] 21044275: KZ, DWG and GenG to worlds from lck would be the best scenario
[1:13:51] lipsnlegs: g2 wont win
[1:13:53] Zencent: they are a 5man team thru and thru
[1:13:59] 21044275: FPX, RNG and TOP from lpl
[1:14:24] 興達電廠棋靈王: ANGEL TO TOP LINE PogChamp PogChamp
[1:14:25] lipsnlegs: Xiaohu is back on form RNG is veyr high chance of winning worlds
[1:14:33] sqradi: i wouldnt hype rng until we see how they do against edg tonight
[1:14:44] lipsnlegs: Bruh they RNG
[1:14:46] Zencent: G2 is a broherhood team. best u can have in sports.
[1:15:03] 21044275: and Langx is hardstuck in diamond 1
[1:15:03] Zencent: Teamwork makes the dream work.
[1:15:08] qqppb: LCK is back on form as well Kappa
[1:15:20] AngieFoxtrot: shenWow SNG Logo shenDerp
[1:15:30] 21044275: Langx is stuck in diamond 1 while one trick top laners reach challenger
[1:15:32] lipsnlegs: hes not peaking @KR_WORST_REGION he was insane in s6 and s7
[1:15:35] 21044275: That's terrible really
[1:15:38] window7player: karma open
[1:15:53] Zencent: LCK is on form but are susceptible to getting thrown off their game in the world of 2019 league of legends
[1:15:57] lipsnlegs: Langx is top 30 super server @21044275
[1:16:09] 21044275: super server is shit
[1:16:28] lipsnlegs: its the 2nd best in the world
[1:16:28] Zencent: LPL over EU over LCK over LPL
[1:16:31] 21044275: it's no where near as competitive as KR server
[1:16:34] lipsnlegs: lol
[1:16:39] 21044275: it's not even as competitive as euw
[1:17:12] lipsnlegs: No where near??? are you stupid. It close but korean is still the best
[1:17:25] 21044275: You're just biased
[1:17:31] lipsnlegs: ???????
[1:17:35] window7player: Maple left FW?
[1:18:11] Zencent: LPL > EU , EU > LCK , LCK > LPL
[1:18:18] 21044275: Xiaoma is top 10 on super server but he has trouble hitting Challenger on KR server
[1:18:23] Zencent: going to be a hell of a worlds.
[1:18:40] lipsnlegs: xiaoma? xiaohu*?
[1:18:40] Zencent: with the offchance TL pulls something out of their ass.
[1:18:53] 21044275: Xiaoma, the guy that plays Darius
[1:19:18] 21044275: And Langx, as you said, top 30 in super server but hardstuck in Diamond 1 KR
[1:19:27] 21044275: that should tell you the difference
[1:19:35] PoliticalMuffin: Imagine even believing DL even has a chance to get out of groups LUL
[1:19:59] Zencent: I believe it
[1:20:12] spook1313_: LUL
[1:20:14] xqf052: I dont think ranking matters that much. Tarzan and chovy are the NO.1 jungler and mid lanner in KR soloq. But GRF still lost to FPX.
[1:20:16] Zencent: TL is NA's only hope
[1:21:03] 21044275: @xqf052 then why do teams not hire diamond players, why do they only scout challenger players?
[1:21:14] 21044275: Rankings matter, no matter what you think
[1:21:19] LoL_Advantage: Winnie the pooh
[1:21:19] Zencent: EU, KR, LPL will have 3 killer teams a piece. NA will only have TL.
[1:22:06] spook1313_: I mean as long as he plays good on stage the soloQ rank doesnt really matter I guess
[1:22:09] lipsnlegs: @xqf052 soloq ranking do matter in terms of skill especially in servers liek KR and China
[1:22:20] xqf052: @21044275 I mean all of them are top-tier players. But some of them probably spend less tie in soloq than others.
[1:22:36] 21044275: @xqf052 spend less, aka 700 games hardstuck diamond 1?
[1:23:06] lipsnlegs: @21044275 whats langx id on KR server
[1:23:15] lipsnlegs: i forgot
[1:23:24] 21044275: let me go check
[1:23:53] raulvhs: NA Elise LUL
[1:23:53] sqradi: ok but
[1:23:55] 21044275: his id is lin qing fans
[1:24:06] sqradi: isnt amazingj 300+ lp or something
[1:24:12] sqradi: by this ranking logic amazingj > langx
[1:24:43] raulvhs: NA gank
[1:25:01] 21044275: yes, amazingj > lanx
[1:25:02] xqf052: @21044275 then why GRF lost to FPX, the players of which apparently have much lower in KR soloq.
[1:25:07] 21044275: amazingj has reached worlds before
[1:25:12] sqradi: LUL

[1:27:16] la7041831: lanx is tras h
[1:27:22] 21044275: KT had an ad carry main in their jungle role
[1:27:31] 21044275: KT had a washed up top laner
[1:27:41] 21044275: KT had a crippled mid laner

[1:29:15] raulvhs: KR is struggling because Riot dumbed down the game
[1:29:22] sqradi: EDG vs RNG waiting room ResidentSleeper
[1:29:48] 21044275: KR was only good cause they abused tracker's knife
[1:29:54] 21044275: and sightstone
[1:29:54] lipsnlegs: ????? @raulvhs Riot removed a large part of the vision game
[1:30:17] 21044275: as soon as riot removed trackers and sightstone, KR became shit
[1:30:23] 21044275: not a coincidence
[1:30:34] 21044275: They have a one dimensional playstyle
[1:30:35] lipsnlegs: theyre best region still lol
[1:30:52] lipsnlegs: KR as a whole is still the best region
[1:30:58] 21044275: they haven't won anything since s7
[1:31:44] xqf052: nice SN
[1:31:48] asdcxzmm: snlz SeemsGood
[1:31:50] 21044275: right now EU is the obvious best region

[1:33:54] sqradi: "just because they haven't won doesn't mean theyre not the best" PEPEGA

[1:34:00] 21044275: just because manchester united haven't won the premier league in many years, doesn't mean they aren't still the best team in England

[1:34:34] wws54300: manu LUL LUL ResidentSleeper
[1:34:37] raulvhs: It's not about being one dimensional... it's about being better when it comes to acting about available information (vision), now the game is a mess since there is more uncertainty with the lack of vision @lipsnlegs
[1:34:44] Wiildiie: NA sucks
[1:35:04] Mechafanboy: it's not like any of this will matter in the end, Korea was pretty heavily favoured last worlds before it actually began and look how that turned out lol

[1:36:28] raulvhs: that is***
[1:36:34] 21044275: I hope riot removes wards altogether, the game would be more fun that way
[1:36:38] wws54300: yea tl will be world champion Kappa Kreygasm

[1:36:52] Mechafanboy: might as well add the entire coaching staff too in that case LUL
[1:37:59] lipsnlegs: @21044275 Would you say EPL is a better league than La liga as a whole?
[1:38:14] sqradi: excluding the coach it technically is still half korean since there's duke too LUL
[1:38:33] raulvhs: the game used to be all about making calculated plays... not sure what the current best playstyle is

[1:41:23] raulvhs: I used to be an EPL hater since their league relies more on the physical than the technical part of the game
[1:41:30] lipsnlegs: @xqf052 youre not seeing the point im making dude, just because a team from a league won the championship doesnt mean the league theyre from is the best

[1:56:16] pylsevold: while Bang was on a downward trend for many years
[1:56:35] pylsevold: Think they saw him as a better investment
[1:56:35] 1kenn1: Teddy was awful at MSI
[1:56:35] goblinguy01: @21044275 ZWuji is Chinese Kappa
[1:57:01] xqf052: @21044275 why he is a toxic player? I want to hear the story.
[1:57:06] B_L_O_O_D_Y: PogChamp
[1:57:09] goblinguy01: @21044275 Did you see the post that Whitez made about Koreans when Edward Zhou sold Imay to him? It was bad, he never got any ruling lol
[1:57:11] Dimashero: is it pro?
[1:57:12] 澀澀母莎奈朵: LUL
[1:57:18] aesf107: LPL LUL
[1:57:22] Drekt: Give me RNG vs EDG :P
[1:57:34] 21044275: @xqf052 he was so toxic in solo queue that Doinb, a very chill player, opted to report him, he was that toxic
[1:57:38] ono_shigata_numen: ???
[1:57:48] ono_shigata_numen: why didnt he aa ashe lol
[1:57:49] 1kenn1: Deft got his revenge vs IG Kreygasm
[1:57:57] narvuntien: GivePLZ EDG vs RNG
[1:58:28] JAG_Blanc: Give us the best team in the world RNG!
[1:58:49] JAG_Blanc: go next
[1:59:01] pylsevold: Excel isnt playing before later today
[1:59:02] goblinguy01: @KR_WORST_REGION He said in the sense of, "Koreans need Chinese money or they have no where to play" I'm being nice because the translation were really harsh, but real. You can google it. When was gifted Imay from EDG"s owner to avoid Riot's multiple team ownership rules
[1:59:04] 21044275: @goblibguy01 Whitez isn't a player but owner, players are techcnically riot's employees, owners are their own entities, riot has no control of what they say
[1:59:11] xqf052: @21044275 I see. I thought you mean he was arrogant and did not practice hard enough.
[1:59:20] goblinguy01: We all know Edward Zhou somehow runs AHQ, Imay and EDG LUL in some way
[1:59:29] 22yrs: what upshitt company
[1:59:34] goblinguy01: I mean Whitez also worked for the LPL and Tencent
[1:59:48] goblinguy01: EDG bought 90% of the AHQ's share, so it's their sister team since s5
[1:59:55] FBHeron: The lyrics to this song are LUL
[1:59:55] narvuntien: Imay was sold to BLG
[1:59:55] goblinguy01: Imay was Edward Esports
[2:00:10] goblinguy01: So Whitez sold it a major company
[2:00:16] goblinguy01: I wonder if he still runs it :P
[2:00:32] 21044275: Chinese are just incredibly racist, streamers and their viewers all refer to Koreans as "bang zi", derogatory term for them
[2:01:02] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I think LCK has better competition around middle table compared to NA but i believe the top 2-3 teams from NA are actually stronger. No way a team like SB or DWG could be 1st place in NA lcs. I just dont see them being that dominant over there.
[2:01:09] narvuntien: Part of the reason that Asia Rift Rivals is so real
[2:01:18] 22yrs: hes so ygly hahhah smlz
[2:01:26] Pray_lol: @Olgon_MingLee JAG would be top 2 NA
[2:01:40] 1kenn1: JAG are trash
[2:01:41] 21044275: Rogue would beat TSM Kappa
[2:01:43] narvuntien: Rouge > TSM
[2:02:01] 1kenn1: JAG ned to be relegated to cblol
[2:02:03] pylsevold: @olgon_minglee when tsm are playing as bad as they are now?
[2:02:07] Pray_lol: CLG #3 team 0-6 against KT LUL
[2:02:20] 1kenn1: JAG and GRF coaching staff need to be relegated
[2:02:26] JAG_Blanc: @1kenn1 :(
[2:02:41] 21044275: Real talk, TSM seems so stacked on paper with BrokenBlade and Akaadian, how come they suck so bad
[2:02:54] 1kenn1: brokenblade awful bruh
[2:03:01] narvuntien: 60 ping Kappa
[2:03:02] Pray_lol: @21044275 everyone besides Bjerg is horrible
[2:03:02] tsama1: the guy on the left looks so wield
[2:03:05] SupraUltra: theyre washed up
[2:03:09] 22yrs: a serious queastion what do the referees talk when they forget what happened in the game ?
[2:03:14] 1kenn1: Bjergsen need to go
[2:03:24] 21044275: @tsama1 he's Australian
[2:03:24] 1kenn1: TSM mismanaged so bad letting DL and sven go
[2:03:28] lovielife: Only beardman is good in tsm
[2:03:35] pylsevold: botlane not alot of synergy is a good reason
[2:03:41] BenChung0888: rogue>tsm
[2:03:55] pylsevold: Akaadian has confidence and experience issues
[2:03:55] judahyayaya: yr dum if you think broken blade is bad
[2:03:56] narvuntien: Smoothie is engage support and Zven defensive ADC
[2:04:12] VanfetusTheFourth: who cares about na teams ResidentSleeper
[2:04:17] pylsevold: Broken Blade lacks alot of exp
[2:04:19] 1kenn1: Zven is awful
[2:04:24] 1kenn1: he needs to go
[2:04:31] 金鎗客56: FW TheSam is Ryze GOD BloodTrail
[2:04:31] narvuntien: Although that still works for FNC...
[2:04:37] pylsevold: Zven is the worst performer by far
[2:04:46] 1kenn1: Zven worst player in NA LCS
[2:04:47] oidududs: who came her because 45 minutes to next lck match?
[2:04:52] lovielife: Zven and sneaky are the worst na adc
[2:04:54] 1RaiseTheBar: does any1 remember the finals where the dude on the left had a bunch of makeup on and sparkles?
[2:04:54] oidududs: here*
[2:04:58] narvuntien: Meee

[2:05:28] AgentXtreme007: coming from lck waiting room
[2:05:32] 1kenn1: I tho Mithy was trash
[2:05:38] 1kenn1: but hes actually good with decent adc
[2:05:43] 21044275: Does NA really have no better jungler than a 28 year old?
[2:05:46] 1kenn1: It was Zven all along
[2:05:57] 21044275: Is NA's jungle talent pool really that shallow?
[2:06:03] acmilan22: UZIIIIIIIIIIII
[2:06:06] narvuntien: Zven = Ezreal 1 trick
[2:06:06] pylsevold: Mithy also didnt get along with the coaching Staff or Bjerg
[2:06:06] 21044275: That a 28 years old is the best JG in the region
[2:06:15] BenChung0888: na best jg is iwd
[2:06:35] narvuntien: Apperently not but I think Sven learnt a lot from Blabber
[2:06:44] 1RaiseTheBar: start game
[2:06:48] sumsum1103: @benchung0888 yeah best jungler in diamond3
[2:06:57] 전설의딱풀: Lck ZZa yo!
[2:07:32] lovielife: Iwd DansGame
[2:07:33] 1RaiseTheBar: why does a 28 year old being the best jungler offend you. are you 14?
[2:07:40] 1RaiseTheBar: thinking you are a prodigy child or something
[2:08:07] SoYouWannaPlay: CmonRaz
[2:08:12] pylsevold: meanwhile Dardoch is stuck in academy...
[2:08:13] 전설의딱풀: What is the Suning?

[2:08:25] igortrolll: it just shows there's no new young talent
[2:08:25] rvyerimie: WutFace WutFace
[2:08:50] narvuntien: Dardoch a solo queue player... and Meteos is still great
[2:08:54] 1RaiseTheBar: imagine being born in 2003 and thinking you are cool lul
[2:08:55] xqf052: 28 year old being the best jungler means they run out of young native talents, which is bad for the region.
[2:08:55] 전설의딱풀: Russia girls team can win 1 game?
[2:08:57] crushy92: k
[2:08:59] 1kenn1: meteos lol
[2:09:01] 21044275: For real though, Tarzaned and Dardoch are actually the 2 best JG talent NA has to offer, so why don't teams give them a try?
[2:09:01] razlol: patch 9.13
[2:09:19] 1RaiseTheBar: that should mean the younger generation is trash no?
[2:09:25] Pray_lol: @21044275 Tarzaned can't even play a scrim without RQ LUL

[2:10:23] Benchung: @21044275 because they are toxic and NA care attitude more than talent LUL LUL
[2:10:50] 1RaiseTheBar: trick2g the best jungler in the game so
[2:11:13] 21044275: Funny, Mlxg has a huge attitude issue especially in soloq, but he still went pro and actually won MSI
[2:11:14] VanfetusTheFourth: EleGiggle = My reaction when NA people talk about talent
[2:11:19] panela_sr: You need to have issues to become an NA jungler tbh
[2:11:28] oliversbrevkasse_yaholup: @Hollowgram If you actuaslly believe that...
[2:11:35] crushy92: NA worst region anyways LUL

[2:13:47] narvuntien: I was pretty sure they would but now it looks like Damwon will
[2:13:48] pylsevold: unless they drastically change something no
[2:13:52] 澀澀母莎奈朵: TF PogChamp
[2:13:57] Benchung: KZ is the best korean team

[3:31:56] DWCuzzz: @mgl_gantulga baron gives you more stats and enhanced minions when nearby to really help you push. Each dragon has a different buff it gives you either more damage speed healing or damage to objectives.

[3:33:11] hermeneutist: he had enough time to channel it while watching karsa come into lane
[3:33:13] yudai95: @mgl_gantulga baron mainly gives u a temporary buff that allows you to buff up mminion waves that are next to you, giving more health and more damage and more range to the minions, so makes it alot easier to siege and destroy turrets with them
[3:33:16] Hydraplayshin: @carryme40 karthus got top side enemy jungle eeediot

[4:06:53] xqf052: @Hydraplayshin MSI is based on the result of spring season. But RNG has changed they roaster since the beginning of the summer season. So RNG right now could be stronger than G2.
[4:06:59] u293400683: thanks
[4:07:14] Hydraplayshin: @xqf052 yes, rng got a top laner who is hard stuck d1 in kkorea server. Very good player bro

[4:10:14] 1kenn1: Uzi paid these teams to not sign Hjarnan
[4:10:18] xqf052: @Hydraplayshin G2 only won the current 6th team in LCK and lost to current 5th team in LPL. You think G2 is the best? Stop being delusional.
[4:10:25] 21044275: @pardalis_ how come RNG lost if Hjarnan got smashed?
[4:10:41] s1l4dr4p: because LoL is a team based game?
[4:10:47] Hydraplayshin: @xqf052 and those teams won their regions a few weeks ago. Whats your point?

[4:49:18] 12Gamer30: @baejoohyun26 he's been mainly playing pressure-absorber for the team, so the onus is never really on him to carry, but he did have a solid spring split when he did have to do more carrying on Suning, so I think that he isn't in a bad situation. He doesn't int too often. That soloq stat is concerning, though.
