[2:50:56] svens_ex_boyfriend: @zirob1 stats that G2 being 0:5 against the team that lost to V5 and almost lost to VG? LUL
[2:51:02] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Geng are a good team i admit but no way they are better than TL.. cmon guys... seriously TL actually were able to make it into MSI finals by beating fking IG in a Bo5. Yes they lost to G2 but G2 are the best team in the world. Nothing wrong losing to them.
[2:51:13] get_updownleftright: FPX isn't as good as RNG and IG cus lack of experience in bo5
[2:51:14] Toxxxicchd: yes
[2:51:15] carryme40: IG just CHOKED UNDER PRESSURE AT MSI AND RIFT RIVALS. YOU WANT THEM TO CHOKE AT WORLDS TOO?

[2:52:15] yamiric: Mystic didn't say anything...
[2:52:19] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: IG at MSI were 9-1 how is that choking? TL beat that team and LPL teams took notes from TL and how to beat IG. TL completely deserve to be 2nd best team in the world only behind G2.
[2:52:22] svens_ex_boyfriend: Imagine being 0:5 against the team that lost to V5 and almost lost to vg and claiming ur the best team in the world LUL
[2:52:23] Zirob1: @mattias_jkpg not if 4 people want to send a message aswell...

[2:52:54] rafapo12: @toxxxicchd its not like tbey werent playing "happy" games in groups
[2:52:56] vicrainbown: SwiftRage
[2:53:03] GoonerCallum: getting 3-0d by TL loool

[2:53:30] Airt1: if you don't think G2 is the best team in the world, then who is? LUL LPL got stomped in rift rivals so don't even think about it LUL
[2:53:31] rafapo12: IG was just too cocky vs TL they thought they could smash them efforelessly while trolling
[2:53:43] Dethrey: Knight become rank 1 on Korean servers, hes a powerful midlaner for TES, TopEsports
[2:53:45] trickspapi: ^
[2:53:48] Toxxxicchd: i didnt say they are still trash, i said the first weeks after msi they were trash just like in quarters at msi
[2:53:51] Zirob1: @toxxxicchd They are actually braindamaged, it won't work
[2:53:56] handonface: FKEN Finish it LUL
[2:54:01] Toxxxicchd: do u even read what we write or are u just strawmanning?
[2:54:02] carryme40: RNG WOULD HAD WON RIFT RIVALS. RNG IS UNDEFEATED AT RIFT RIVALS. STILL ARE.
[2:54:03] decco41: RR doesnt say much about worlds cuz TES and JDG probably wont go to worlds, FPX looked fine , IG’s current form is better than in MSI and RR DAESuppy

[2:55:25] Dethrey: did FPX give RNG their only loss, hmm hmm
[2:55:28] carryme40: IG CHOKED TO TEAM LIQUID, THEN THEY CHOKED TO KOREANS AT RIFT RIVALS. DO NOT SEND IG TO WORLDS SO THEY CAN CHOKE AT WORLDS TOO!!!
[2:55:31] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: NA isn't trash. NA is around 2nd/3rd best region atm. Nothing wrong with that. Their top 3-4 teams are actually pretty good look at the names: TL, CLG, TSM, C9. Thats how competitive the league looks.
[2:55:33] Zirob1: ABANDONED LUL

Their toplaner is the best in the league...
[3:02:38] EthernnALS: LUL

[3:04:36] Zirob1: IG OWNER AND XIAO XIAO POG
[3:04:41] carryme40: SN VS TES IS NOW, THEY MOVED RNG TO EARLY TIMES BECAUSE THEY KNOW FANS WANT IT

[3:06:14] adroit5927: RNG will easily win worlds with knight on top POGGY
[3:06:14] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: I think both TSM and CLG will make it worlds this year but im not so sure about 100T... i believe 100T are stronger than TL but they need the points.. i believe 100T will actually win the split, TSM 2nd on points and CLG will be able to defeat TL in the gaunlet. Might not sound like that but current CLG power level tells me that.
[3:06:17] Zirob1: Just a little hyped up
[3:06:19] carryme40: WUNDER DONT SPEAK CHINESE, COMMUNICATION PROBLEM :)
