[1:07:54] carryme40: RNG FPX, TOP , SN would be first place in na and eu . LPL is the strongest region
[1:07:57] sqradi: lms is dead, they are smart to abandon ship
[1:07:59] TheFistification: They also speak the same languange, or how does the taiwanese-chinese think work exactly?
[1:08:02] h011ywood: guys whos better, rookie or doinb or xiye
[1:08:06] Zempester: well yeah. the largest player base should have the best players
[1:08:08] clay031: @will_o_will yeah but they made msi semis 4 years in a row, they just choked at worlds and lost to PVB because they let a champ through that got banned in 99% of games against one of the better top laners in the world
