[0:26:42] goblinguy01: How can TES throw such a big lead in Rift Rivals WutFace
[0:26:54] ktkmsama: @goblibguy01 Camp NUGURINT
[0:27:01] goblinguy01: Loken/Ben just seems meh most games or Loken is just bad
[0:27:09] goblinguy01: Utility ADC aren't the Chinese way
[0:27:32] ktkmsama: Who would be your number 4?
[0:27:40] AnOldDinosaur: SN
[0:28:04] goblinguy01: JackeyLove, Uzi, SMLZ, Iboy, Mystic aren't passive laners lol
[0:28:16] goblinguy01: How has Loken kept that LCK style in this 3 years in the LPL
[0:28:21] ktkmsama: Mystic really?
[0:28:31] ktkmsama: He didnt look too good yesterday
[0:28:36] goblinguy01: Yes. Mystic plays nothing like a Korean ADC
[0:28:42] goblinguy01: That's my point :P
[0:28:50] basement111: Donald Trump will out lane DoinB tonight.
[0:28:52] ktkmsama: Depends on what your def of a Korean ADC is
[0:28:59] ktkmsama: the Pray type or the Deft type
[0:29:10] ktkmsama: or the Nuclear LUL
[0:29:11] AnOldDinosaur: lck tomorrow VoHiYo
[0:29:11] goblinguy01: Pray Type is LCK
[0:29:22] goblinguy01: Deft was forged in the fires of LPL though, and got better
[0:29:36] ktkmsama: Tbh no pray types left in LCK
[0:29:39] goblinguy01: Deft in LCK s4 was pretty bad if you watched any old OGN
[0:29:41] ktkmsama: apart from sangyoon
[0:29:58] goblinguy01: We can't say Deft is a typical Korean ADC though
[0:29:58] ktkmsama: well and pray himself cos he unretired again LUL
[0:30:08] ktkmsama: @goblibguy01 he is now though
[0:30:20] ktkmsama: aggressive plays
[0:30:24] goblinguy01: When he played in the LPL, he matched the aggression LUL
[0:30:36] ktkmsama: @goblibguy01 when he played in LPL he had that jayce game LUL
[0:30:41] ktkmsama: in worlds
[0:30:47] goblinguy01: TP from s5 LUL
[0:31:03] ktkmsama: Korean adcs now for me are the Ruler/JAG Teddy style
[0:31:11] goblinguy01: ^^
[0:31:11] ktkmsama: Lategame hyper
[0:31:21] goblinguy01: Pray would have been a good candidate, but not anymore
[0:31:31] tacorainbow: ranked que is down but these slant eyes can play?
[0:31:33] ktkmsama: Utility adcs just dont work anymore
[0:31:45] goblinguy01: Chinese ADC had two stages - WeiXiao style and Uzi style
[0:31:49] ktkmsama: Too many champs with it all
[0:31:58] ktkmsama: How would you rate NaMei?
[0:32:06] goblinguy01: I would consider San, NaMei to be copy WX too much
[0:32:14] goblinguy01: He is was great though
[0:32:22] goblinguy01: S2-s4 = WX clones Kappa
[0:32:27] goblinguy01: Except Uzi of course
[0:32:28] ktkmsama: shame he never showed up internationally BibleThump
[0:32:38] weebonduty: ANELE
[0:32:47] ktkmsama: Even Uzi i'd say is more of a ruler type
[0:32:52] ktkmsama: lategame puppy solocarry
[0:32:54] goblinguy01: I saw enough s4 LPL to know he is good lol
[0:33:00] ktkmsama: When I think aggro chinese adcs Krystal pops to mind
[0:33:15] goblinguy01: NaMei lvl mid roam on Twitch while skilling Stealth
[0:33:22] goblinguy01: Helping U win lane at minute 1
[0:33:39] goblinguy01: Uzi can play aggro though
[0:33:43] ktkmsama: Theres a reason Edg always won LPL LUL
[0:34:01] weebonduty: dont do drugs skrt ANELE
[0:34:05] goblinguy01: I mean s4 EDG was pretty unfair :P
[0:34:23] goblinguy01: They had 2 World Elite players, the best ADC, A good tank player and utility mage Mid
[0:34:34] goblinguy01: They copied the World Elite playstyle LUL
[0:34:39] goblinguy01: EDG is just WE 2.0
[0:34:49] ChalieClair: pepeD
[0:35:10] goblinguy01: Except U wasn't as good as Misaya, same for Pawn
[0:35:11] mikelavz: Hi everyone! :D

[0:37:37] goblinguy01: LUL\
[0:38:17] goblinguy01: s2 = TPA, S3 = SKT, S4 = OMG (RiP), s5 = SKT, s6 = SKT, s7 = Samsung
[0:38:33] goblinguy01: Pray doesn't have it, had had more chances then Uzi to win worlds
[0:38:43] goblinguy01: Yep
[0:38:58] goblinguy01: Every other Najin Shield team was the world's winner
[0:39:07] goblinguy01: It all started with an "upset" from TPA
[0:39:13] goblinguy01: We all knew TPA was just better lol
[0:39:27] schraderhannes: 15 years? ResidentSleeper
[0:39:57] rxthunder1: s1 where everyone else didn't know what the fk League was LUL
[0:40:02] Aenonarr: Best team in the world right now is Mammoth from the OPL.
[0:40:37] goblinguy01: TPA matched well with World Elite, that's how were able to beat them at all in S2. TPA/CLG. Eu were the only teams to beat World Elite in before their undefeated streak
[0:40:45] goblinguy01: Then IG beat them randomly LUL
[0:40:52] rxthunder1: waiiitttt..s4 OMG? what u smoking
[0:41:00] fh_bl4ckryder: 2-0 FPX?
[0:41:04] Ghost_of_Dividion: why did you say s4 = OMG when SSW won
[0:41:13] goblinguy01: I said RiP
[0:41:14] basement111: dam i remember when i first started watching league in s4
[0:41:23] basement111: i still remember gogoing's ryze at worlds
[0:41:29] rxthunder1: overall best worlds was s4 with assassin meta
[0:41:29] goblinguy01: Since OMG broke the beating TPA, win worlds curse
[0:41:39] rxthunder1: much more exciting to watch s4 out of all seasons
[0:41:40] goblinguy01: I should have said, "Beat Pray, win worlds"
[0:41:57] goblinguy01: S8 meta was better Kappa
[0:42:08] goblinguy01: I want to see TheShy on Jayce dealing 26k damage in 25 minutes Pog
[0:42:23] rxthunder1: well aside from toplane where s4 meta was maokai and ryze 24/7
[0:42:31] wifi12345678910: !song

[0:46:20] rxthunder1: @ktkmsama more than often he fails
[0:46:58] ktkmsama: @aznboi_126 I dont think his bad, he just makes big brain plays and ints
[0:47:05] sma55ive: snake (now lng) is a good team and they will wreck TES easy
[0:47:06] goblinguy01: Guys, let's make a guess. What is more likely to happen? Griffin makes it worlds, DL gets out of groups or SKT misses worlds Kappa
[0:47:07] NocturnVenomKRYP: NASUSSSSSSSSS
[0:47:08] fawwazashraf: WE will win -DoubleLift 2018 WOrlds
[0:47:11] Varlin: that one guy is going fucking nuts lmao
[0:47:17] goblinguy01: I know my answer - Griffin never making it to worlds.
[0:47:32] fawwazashraf: @goblibguy01 DL never get out from groups
[0:47:45] ktkmsama: @goblibguy01 GRIFFINT LUL
[0:47:46] rxthunder1: @ktkmsama burn flash miss bard q for no reason? clap clap
[0:47:50] goblinguy01: @fawwazashraf Your betting your odds over Griffin choking in the gauntlet? That is risky
[0:47:51] ktkmsama: Griffin is never winning a playoff game
[0:47:52] jianme: WOW
[0:48:01] basement111: WutFace
[0:48:11] himself4396: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:48:14] fawwazashraf: @goblibguy01 Griffin going 2nd place again in LCK LUL, go to worlds by point LUL
[0:48:15] ktkmsama: Have they even won a bo5 that wasnt promotion?
[0:48:16] goblinguy01: I'd say Griffin 5% to make worlds, SKT 55% to miss worlds, and 45% DL gets out of groups
[0:48:22] Elba__neado: D:
[0:48:29] Varlin: ever roll swords neck gains makes griffin stronger
[0:48:37] ktkmsama: Griffin need to get 2nd
[0:48:40] goblinguy01: If Griffin makes it worlds, I will become a Griffin fan

[0:48:51] Smilyou: @lpl Thank for the subtitles BloodTrail
[0:48:54] goblinguy01: Griffin is still tilted after losing to Mid Panth
[0:48:57] ktkmsama: I'd say KZ gets in by points
[0:49:04] ktkmsama: DWG wins the split
[0:49:09] Varlin: @basement111 shieeeetttt they fucked then OMEGALUL
[0:49:11] ktkmsama: GENG ( LUL ) climbs the gauntlet
[0:49:24] ktkmsama: KZ or SKT if they make it in
[0:49:25] cheshmate: Facts: DL will never win worlds
[0:49:38] goblinguy01: It's sad when the chat thinks DL has a higher chance to get out of groups over Griffin making it worlds xD
[0:49:40] basement111: DL will win worlds this year
