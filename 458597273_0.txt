[1:53:43] carryme40: @adroit5927 when you play in the same league as theshy, anyone would look bad too.. if langx was in the NA LCS, he would be praised as the best top laner.

[1:55:10] Archie4311: yea why does lck have such long delays between games
[1:55:15] carryme40: LANGX IS PLAYING IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS THESHY AND HE IS ON A TEAM WITH UZI, KARSA, XIAOHU , AND MING. IT IS UNFAIR TO GET ANY RESPECT EVEN IF HE IS PLAYING GOOD.
