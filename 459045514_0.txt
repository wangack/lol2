[0:48:48] HystericsCasts: WE & IG are the oldest orgs in the LPL so I would say yes
[0:48:53] CandySlash: LPL IS FUN NOT BORING AS LCK
[0:49:02] HystericsCasts: first series will be chaos so yes again
[0:49:12] nothankyouidontwanna: hmm okay ill tune in then
[0:49:37] domanoes: I just witched out of LCK cause it was boring as shit. Gotta say I enjoy this wait screen more than the games there already.
[0:49:51] northlansing: ^
[0:49:52] HystericsCasts: The casting was entertaining though
[0:49:57] HystericsCasts: like the banter was 10/10
[0:50:06] domanoes: well, the LCK podcast is amazing
[0:50:12] domanoes: the games are not.

[0:51:59] h011ywood: 1:53am Los Angeles
[0:52:09] JAG_Blanc: @HystericsCasts is RNG gonna win worlds or RNG?
[0:52:30] HystericsCasts: Here's what I think - our three teams are FPX, IG & RNG
[0:52:36] domanoes: I remember last split GRF vs SKT in second round, one fo the best series this year so far. What the hell happened to that?
[0:52:44] HystericsCasts: I think RNG OR IG wins worlds
[0:52:46] JAG_Blanc: with RNG winning it all
[0:53:00] HystericsCasts: But the IG that faced FPX
[0:53:01] NoSopaForYou: this game looks like shit zoomed in. i must admit lol
[0:53:08] h011ywood: Has RNG been the same since they lost at worlds last year
[0:53:24] HystericsCasts: RNG were on a slow recovery, especially after changing out their top laner
[0:53:29] NoSopaForYou: imagine the fog of war actually looks like that
[0:53:34] HystericsCasts: They now have Langx (XiaoAL who was on SN)
[0:53:41] JAG_Blanc: thats if doinb qualifies for worlds first Kappa
[0:53:49] h011ywood: IG vs FPX was great. I think FPX is close to IG
[0:53:58] HystericsCasts: FPX are still first remember, 10-1
[0:54:04] CombinedZeus: can rng win it all without ever playing through langx tho
[0:54:20] nothankyouidontwanna: jackeylove is a nutter wow
[0:54:26] HystericsCasts: If Xiaohu is performing incredibly like he is now, yes
[0:54:44] HystericsCasts: If they can diversify at least to another lane for sure
[0:54:51] JAG_Blanc: RNG should get Zoom
[0:55:00] CandySlash: og
[0:55:05] HystericsCasts: I would rather Gimgoon/Duke/TheShy
[0:55:12] CandySlash: that kaisa angle lul
[0:55:19] CombinedZeus: zoom cant play weak side as good as langx
[0:55:23] Ajs3095: Kreygasm
[0:55:25] HystericsCasts: Gimgoon can though
[0:55:26] CombinedZeus: and rng top is always weak side
