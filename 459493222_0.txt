[5:00:37] fridaychill: FPX beat RNG
[5:00:43] fridaychill: You forgot that
[5:00:44] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: STUPID LPL TEAMS BEAT IG LUL BUT G2 CANT LUL LUL LUL
[5:00:45] thephelixz: NA is still 4th
[5:00:45] Rachador: FPX 2 kr, rng no
[5:00:45] Sing3d: TES won 2:0 and RNG won 2:0
[5:00:46] Fedelta: @Olgon_MingLee reasonable
[5:00:48] rafapo12: @Olgon_MingLee I wanted one of your hot takes about NA teams FeelsBadMan
[5:00:55] carryme40: xiaohu is the best midlaner in the lpl. you can argue for doinb though.
[5:00:56] Calrael: @Slowacki True. The difference this year is that the explosive game play, if done well, seems to win out over the slow, scaling teamfight gameplay very consistently though. So I still think teams with that sort of style have an advantage
[5:01:02] welm22: G2 0-5 IG LUL
[5:01:07] Rachador: fpx 2 kr, Rng no
[5:01:09] hermeneutist: @beem0o probably Doinb or Knight9
[5:01:10] Scaloriox: LOOK AT ME IM SPAMMING CAPS LOCK WITH EMOTE LUL LUL LUL
[5:01:12] numan577: are who is win?
[5:01:17] jesusVdeVelas: it is coming again, WE comeback to playoffs an Suning out of PO
[5:01:24] Qantas124: RNG no KR
[5:01:27] thephelixz: IMAGINE HAVING TL AS YOUR BEST TEAM LUL
[5:01:28] syby: even tl can beat ig
[5:01:30] weebonduty: happy games 4HEad
[5:01:32] hermeneutist: actually, Doinb is probably #1 mid now, Knight9 is probably slightly above Rookie
[5:01:35] Sing3d: WE TOMORROW = "Lets bench Mystic" Kappa
[5:01:39] Scaloriox: @dormodontootbot thx m8
[5:01:40] jesusVdeVelas: WE have a very easy schedule to the end
[5:01:45] AnOldDinosaur: dogdogHey bye chat dogdogH
[5:01:46] 凯撒无畏: yeah RNG no KR
[5:01:47] hermeneutist: Xiaohu and Kuro are close behind
[5:01:48] numan577: are who win
[5:01:48] Slowacki: @Calrael yeah, definitely, hence the success of G2 on MSI. But on the same MSI G2 dropped games to PVB and IG lost to TL. Sometimes those teams just lose too much control and they are not able to pick it back up again :P
[5:01:52] aries_jw: Doublelift best adc in the world
[5:01:52] carryme40: i don't see how you can not put rng as #1 team in the world at this point.
[5:01:55] jesusVdeVelas: V5 RW VG and LGD
[5:02:00] rafapo12: @thephelixz LUL it's better than having TSM or C9
[5:02:10] Sing3d: KonCha HAVE A GOOD DAY KonCha
[5:02:11] 03c63ef3: SourPls
[5:02:16] eddy1114: Censorship on twitch LUL

[5:02:26] Rachador: ig kr, fpx kr, rng no
[5:02:27] vicviper: LUL even WE can beat IG, so?
[5:02:29] birkinbagowner: EU DansGame NA DansGame
[5:02:41] carryme40: BARON IS WHY YOU DON"T PLAY KARMA ADC KIDS
[5:02:44] hermeneutist: even Ning can beat IG LUL
[5:02:53] thephelixz: @rafapo12 C9 beat them, but still trash team. And TL is just an average NA team LUL
[5:02:57] jesusVdeVelas: Xiaohu on Corki PogChamp
[5:03:01] carryme40: SUNING HAD NO ADC DAMAGE TO DO BARON. THAT WHY THEY LOST WITH A KARMA ADC
[5:03:07] Calrael: @Slowacki Well, PVB is actually a more explosive team than even G2 or IG so off course that can happen. They just can't do that consistently :D As for what happened to IG against TL...I still have no idea
[5:03:12] Clairfoyance: @God_of_Lee_Sin RNG 2-0
[5:03:13] alan1nz: TriHard TriHard can we yeet alinity’s cat?
[5:03:26] hermeneutist: @Calrael Nint happened
[5:03:31] vicviper: LUL like I said before, you can cheese any team in LPL, good luck doing it on all 3 teams
[5:03:31] Rachador: by @HystericsCasts
[5:03:41] Slowacki: @hermeneutist lol, pretty much
[5:03:50] beem0o: WutFace
[5:03:51] Malevolent1: Hysterics PogChamp
[5:03:52] Slowacki: like in the last IG series, Ning pretty much lost the game solo
[5:03:53] OGRedd: THIS SONG WHAT IS IT
[5:03:59] HystericsCasts: Malevolent PogChamp
[5:04:02] Clairfoyance: @alan1nz D:
[5:04:05] carryme40: i swear, RNG has to be the #1 or at worst #2 team in the world after this win.
[5:04:17] russianbot2020trump: TriHard 7
[5:04:20] hermeneutist: some teams you can int jungler and get laner fed; other teams will snowball off your feeds and beat you right up
[5:04:31] Malevolent1: PogChamp
[5:04:33] Calrael: @hermeneutist lol maybe yeah...though all of IG seemed to just play so far beneath their regular level that series. I had no idea what I was watching
[5:04:35] kurtyyyoh: LPL <<<< EU
[5:04:36] ultimec1a: TriHard
[5:04:37] BerKay35_: shipHYPERS
[5:04:41] Rachador: PogChamp
[5:04:54] Quinn__Quinn: Na music
[5:05:00] MilkInvictus: just starting or?
[5:05:01] hermeneutist: i'm pretty sure a good part of it was underestimating TL
[5:05:12] carryme40: i am rooting for WE, they did rng a huge favor by beating iG
[5:05:14] hermeneutist: TL were prepared too
[5:05:20] vicviper: LUL IG is just coin flipping
