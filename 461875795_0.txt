[1:07:11] window7player: im not a g2 fan...but man...they are good
[1:07:22] HystericsCasts: I mean it counts
[1:07:38] HystericsCasts: They lost the bot lane in that game before Garen was even involved
[1:07:39] AKAROH: @window7player OMG lost all their good players because their players all have attitude problems arguing against each other in the past and I dont know if thats changed
[1:07:46] BestIZedIZimbabwe: idk which team will win Worlds but I know 100% that EU will win it.
[1:07:56] demiurggermanec247: They lost people's faith in their superiority, that's all
[1:07:59] AKAROH: Plus G2 are still #1 they dont really care
[1:08:04] athoned: @HystericsCasts yes actually. mowgli had more impact than jankos
[1:08:11] AKAROH: they are playing soloq in LEC
[1:08:16] HystericsCasts: But I agree G2 are still #1 undisputed
[1:08:37] JAG_Blanc: RNG is #1
[1:08:45] demiurggermanec247: @HystericsCasts isn't it possible that had Wunder play something else they would have won?
[1:08:51] BestIZedIZimbabwe: Fnatic or G2 will win Worlds. Maybe even Splyce
[1:09:06] demiurggermanec247: BTW, CN stream and everyone dicusses EU LUL
[1:09:08] ItsPacstar: @athoned you have to consider lane pressure as well

[1:10:39] AKAROH: @window7player Idk if OMG know how to do that
[1:10:54] demiurggermanec247: @BestIZedIZimbabwe Tris mid isn't trolling
[1:10:55] johnkrv: they are trying things now that they can without losing much
[1:11:01] 21044275: I actually find it ridiculous that LPL don't even try to hide their biased schedule towards RNG

[1:12:04] window7player: @akaroh maybe they dont...no one knows...
[1:12:16] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @kr_worst_region what region are you from?
[1:12:43] ItsPacstar: @Srinivas_neeli why would there be a fine? They lost its their choice who to pick as a team, if they won with it would you ask the same question?
[1:12:45] JAG_Blanc: as long as LPL or LCK wins I'm happy :)
[1:12:56] johnkrv: worlds is so different than other splits .. teams try really hard.. cant tell for sure who is the best

[1:13:53] 21044275: I'd rather want NA to win over LCK
[1:13:58] johnkrv: delusional @roqtt
[1:14:06] johnkrv: lul
[1:14:17] 21044275: the best case scenario is for either G2 or RNG to win worlds

[1:14:26] 21044275: Next best case scenario is FPX or Fnatic
[1:14:30] sqradi: how is it delusional to want the best region in the world to win? the NA?
[1:14:37] BestIZedIZimbabwe: Worlds is by far by far the most important tournament. after Season ends nobody asks "hey who won lpl/lck/lec/lcs?" they only ask "hey who won worlds?"

[1:17:54] AKAROH: Notice how NA took NA out of NALCS and kept it as LCS? Its because most of the players aren't even North American
