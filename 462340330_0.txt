[0:56:18] heggra: IG FIGHTING
[0:56:31] wingsofdegeneratex: @TheScarySnail i know, i never use it so it doesnt matter
[0:56:43] 21044275: What I'm hoping for is RNG winning the split, Top gets second place and goes on points
[0:56:50] 21044275: Then SNG or IG wins the gauntlet
[0:56:55] selfmadepeach: like teemo says: size doesnt me everything

[0:59:01] JAG_Blanc: I strongly disagree that TES is a world class team
[0:59:01] 21044275: RNG, SN and IG all have the tools to do well, not FPX and TES

[1:03:27] samgreig98: DoinB needs to go to worlds
[1:03:36] demiurggermanec247: We start with WE-LGD?
[1:03:43] Igorece1: 2-0 for WE
[1:03:52] LmaoLp: lets go nibiria's LGD prediction POGGERS
[1:03:56] 21044275: Why does Doinb need to go to worlds when he chokes every playoffs?
[1:04:17] 21044275: It's like asking for LPL to be humiliated during bracket stage
[1:04:21] samgreig98: Theshy ?
[1:04:48] maxt23: xddd
[1:04:48] samgreig98: Hmmm because he is top 3 best mid in world. They would do good internationally imo
[1:05:05] 21044275: top 3 best mid? uhhh not even close man
[1:05:13] samgreig98: name 3 better XD
[1:05:17] demiurggermanec247: @21044275 assuming FPX would come out of groups, which is unlikely
[1:05:22] 21044275: caps, showmaker, rookie
[1:05:26] samgreig98: do NOT include faker
[1:05:34] Nibiria: @LmaoLp i believe in LGD's ability to show up when it no longer matters
[1:05:36] 21044275: xiaohu
[1:05:40] Nibiria: if they did it last split they can do it again
[1:05:41] fabianptft: rookie Kappa
[1:05:43] 21044275: that's 4 already
[1:05:46] demiurggermanec247: @21044275 Thrownaker top 3 mid? LUL
[1:05:47] JAG_Blanc: showmaker Kappa
[1:05:49] samgreig98: Rookie?
[1:05:55] LmaoLp: @Nibiria idk man, it's BLG that's up against iG Keepo
[1:05:55] samgreig98: Showmaker???
[1:05:57] JAG_Blanc: are u kidding? Showmaker?
[1:06:03] Nibiria: oof
[1:06:05] 1122121a: how can the teams qualify for the worlds?
[1:06:11] 1122121a: some1 can answer?

[1:06:25] Nibiria: thanks haha
[1:06:34] 21044275: Nemesis is also better than Doinb

[1:06:36] tonykim878: knight is overrated
[1:06:48] samgreig98: Nemesis.
[1:06:51] 21044275: Knight is at least mechanically better than Doinb
[1:06:57] joyleslie: anybody here?
[1:06:59] 1122121a: @21044275 how can the teams qualify for the worlds?
[1:07:10] fabianptft: knight is better than nemesis showmaker
[1:07:23] joyleslie: win the summer champion
[1:07:25] Kimi: kreepo ?
[1:07:34] 21044275: RNG wins the split, qualify 1st seed, TES gets second place, qualify on points, IG wins gauntlet @messeverywhere
[1:07:36] maxt23: he is such an FPX hater lmao
[1:07:55] maxt23: only IG and RNG are good enough to him
[1:08:08] LmaoLp: @21044275 nah, RNG wins split, iG gets by on points, TES get through the gauntlet
[1:08:08] 21044275: I'm less of a FPX hater, and more of a Doinb hater
[1:08:16] 21044275: I actually like FPX, but I don't like Doinb
[1:08:26] samgreig98: Why
[1:08:35] 1122121a: @21044275 only 1 team can qualify from every league or what?
[1:08:38] demiurggermanec247: How can one hate Naut mid player? Better than Azorki at least
[1:08:54] Zontrexx: but doinb shows us renekenton and kled mid
[1:08:55] joyleslie: why?doinb did really well this season
[1:08:58] demiurggermanec247: @messeverywhere ***
[1:08:59] 21044275: I dislike how Doinb chokes every playoffs he has ever played in
[1:09:07] samgreig98: LMAOOO you said showmaker, are you watching LCK?
[1:09:12] 21044275: Doinb has never NOT choked playoffs
[1:09:17] 1122121a: @demiurggermanec247 man im asking i didn't know
[1:09:45] demiurggermanec247: @messeverywhere all the info can be found on that site
[1:09:59] demiurggermanec247: Or maybe Riot official stite
[1:10:05] demiurggermanec247: site*
[1:10:05] 21044275: People like Doinb because he picks unvoncentional champs, but ignores the fact that he is utterly trash during bo5s
[1:10:16] 1122121a: i already search
[1:10:22] demiurggermanec247: @21044275 what about 2015 summer playoffs?
[1:10:24] 1122121a: but didn't found anything
[1:10:24] 21044275: His cheese style of play is only good for regular season
[1:11:22] samgreig98: if IG come 2nd do they qualify for worlds?
[1:11:27] samgreig98: i know its unlikely
[1:11:45] joyleslie: yes
[1:12:11] samgreig98: i dotn even think they can come 2nd
[1:12:20] demiurggermanec247: @messeverywhere ok then. From ach of LEC, LCS, LCK and LPL qualify three teams: the team which won Summer split of each of the leagues, the team with most points among the remaining teams and the victor of Regional finals - 12 teams from 4 regions to sum up
[1:12:25] demiurggermanec247: each*
[1:12:35] joyleslie: me neither
[1:13:02] 1122121a: @demiurggermanec247 man thank you <3
[1:13:09] 1122121a: finally
[1:13:24] tommychat55: @demiurggermanec247 15 from 5, LMS follows the same format for Worlds qualification
[1:13:36] 21044275: Why has LGD not kicked PYL yet?
[1:13:43] 21044275: How is this dude still playing in lpl
[1:13:44] samgreig98: who you guys think the 3rd EU team will be?
[1:13:55] samgreig98: Splyce? OG?
[1:13:55] tommychat55: @samgreig98 Splyce
[1:13:56] 21044275: G2, Fnatic, Splyce
[1:13:57] demiurggermanec247: @TommyChat yea, I forgot, I still think in the way of 2015-2016 Worlds
[1:14:02] maxt23: Splyce
[1:14:15] joyleslie: you really think RD is better than PYL?
[1:14:23] Rhinne: ?
[1:14:31] samgreig98: TSM Pog
[1:14:31] 21044275: I think any rookie support is better than PYL
[1:14:35] tommychat55: @samgreig98 i think EU Finals will be G2 vs Splyce actually
[1:14:42] joyleslie: lol
[1:15:00] 21044275: Mystic still can't speak Chinese?
[1:15:16] 21044275: He's been in China for as long as Doinb has
[1:15:18] therealantonshudder: sadly g2 will win anyway
[1:15:19] samgreig98: @TommyChat Good call tbh, it must be G2 and either splyce or fnatic
[1:15:24] joyleslie: he can
[1:15:40] 21044275: He just spoke Korean
[1:15:46] demiurggermanec247: @messeverywhere also as TommyChat pointed out three teams from LMS just like with LEC, etc.; two teams from Vietnam (victor of Summer split and of regional finals) and victors of summer splits in seven Wildcard regions
[1:15:50] Miller57: is he crying?
[1:15:54] 21044275: If it were Doinb he would never spoke Korean in that situation
[1:16:00] Nibiria: @21044275 why would he not speak his native language in an interview
[1:16:06] joyleslie: lol
[1:16:10] samgreig98: Damwon gaming getting trashed by HLE hahaha
[1:16:10] Nibiria: doinb goes above and beyond
[1:16:15] Miller57: trueeeee
[1:16:28] LmaoLp: btw @21044275 fwiw if iG make final 4 then TES can't qualify on points :P
[1:16:49] joyleslie: doinb never treated himself as a korean...
[1:16:58] 21044275: Doinb isn't even the only example, most footballers are fluent in new languages by 2-3 years
[1:17:09] demiurggermanec247: @samgreig98 ofc they do, Flame in top
[1:17:20] samgreig98: Weird sub after gsme 1
[1:17:24] Sing3d: @21044275 Gareth Bale? Kappa
[1:17:37] 1122121a: @demiurggermanec247 I really appreciate thank you man for telling me everything
[1:17:38] JAG_Blanc: yeah lets ignore the fact that different people have different language learning capacities
[1:17:38] 21044275: He's Welsh so it doesn't count Kappa
[1:17:43] tommychat55: @demiurggermanec247 + the 3rd team from each except LPL, cause an LPL team won Worlds last year has to go through play ins against the Champions of wild card regions
[1:17:44] thedraine11: where
[1:18:09] samgreig98: Showmaker is atrash

[1:50:18] y0ngy0ng: shouldve yolo to HLE man it hurts
[1:50:19] demiurggermanec247: Does anyone else have lags?
[1:50:28] Sing3d: ShoeMaker FeelsBadMan
[1:50:40] halloderbaer: they also won the fight because WE started it with 50% hp. on full hp caitlyn would have shredded them
[1:50:49] hermeneutist: beishang's FH is so giga value
[1:50:59] arthilin: DWG tops didn't play hot today FeelsBadMan

[1:51:25] arthilin: DWG baron call at end monkaS
[1:51:29] 21044275: first VG now LGD
[1:51:32] Clairfoyance: Dota 2 has 6 major international tourney this year while Lol has 2 and here we are watching these irrelevant teams that no one cares about playing for nothing LUL
[1:51:38] crystal_kamikaze: enable AYAYA PunOko
[1:51:38] demiurggermanec247: @21044275 counters Corki
[1:51:39] Laphx: @21044275 its getting played in solo lanes in every region
[1:51:41] y0ngy0ng: i saw 40k$ bet on DWG LUL LUL
[1:51:41] halloderbaer: @21044275 pretty common all around the world right now
[1:51:45] Sing3d: Tristana mid is also played in other regionos
[1:51:51] Sing3d: regions*
[1:52:02] Laphx: trist top also got played in na, not sure if other regions got it top though
[1:52:15] Clairfoyance: @KR_WORST_REGION i feel u
[1:52:19] demiurggermanec247: @Lofi_Chill and then in Dota no one watches tier two -> no new players
[1:52:25] crystal_kamikaze: Voyboy played it first :)
[1:52:26] halloderbaer: NA is a wildcard region, they do all kind of nonsense
[1:53:01] NocturnVenomKRYP: HAHAHAHAHAHA
[1:53:10] FireFox167: LUL ^
[1:53:13] kiyoeyoshioka: @KR_WORST_REGION you're kidding me ?
[1:53:14] 21044275: I don't understand anything when watching Dota even though it's also a MOBA
[1:53:25] KaIaxia: He's not wrong , dota is better to watch.
[1:53:26] TronWeasley: gg
[1:53:26] Clairfoyance: @demiurggermanec247 what LUL
[1:53:32] Xeraish: yea, that top Tristana was horrible both game, lost hard
[1:53:34] tommychat55: @KR_WORST_REGION dota exists only 10 days per year as a sport
[1:53:41] Crnlpotato: dotas fun to watch, league sometimes is so fkin slow
[1:53:48] 21044275: I literally don't understand how Dota works
[1:53:50] maykayolo: LUL
[1:53:52] KaIaxia: League is slow thanks to the " laning phase "
[1:53:53] crystal_kamikaze: what's dota :)
[1:53:58] kiyoeyoshioka: @Crnlpotato you mean LCK and NA right ?
[1:54:00] 삼도천심해어: Kyle > league caster
[1:54:12] KaIaxia: Or at least it feels slow, even though dota games usually last longer
[1:54:18] y0ngy0ng: kyle LUL
[1:54:19] Sing3d: Yeah, Dota competitive is really fun to watch, its a shame that Riot hates roaming
[1:54:28] Xeraish: none understands dota, it's a fiesta, people die 20 times per game and still can win
[1:54:37] demiurggermanec247: @Lofi_Chill you ever read what Dota tier two-three players write? They don't have anything from Dota, and it makes people less interested in trying to become pro players
[1:54:47] Sing3d: League champions are more fun to watch/play than most heroes in Dota, but the meta is so damn simple and slow
[1:54:55] fawwazashraf: in Dota u can carry the team alone LUL
[1:54:56] Crnlpotato: @Glast1234 no eu?
[1:55:03] so4_kimmrich: League is only slow if teams are bad
[1:55:09] 1kenn1: season 8 meta was nice
[1:55:13] kiyoeyoshioka: There's no game that can compete with League as an e-sport scene
[1:55:14] Clairfoyance: @demiurggermanec247 dota is lot smaller than league
[1:55:17] Iron_Rice_Bowl: yeah go watch G2 play and tell me the meta is slow
[1:55:17] Zayx13: why are you saying that the meta is slow hello_
[1:55:18] vhakann: mirtharin <3
[1:55:21] KaIaxia: @Glast1234 Dota 2.
[1:55:21] crystal_kamikaze: na > eu
[1:55:22] DemonDm1: Que buena partida la conchaetumadre! Valio cada maldito segundo de mi vida de virgen miserable
[1:55:27] halloderbaer: lol bademan what are you doing
[1:55:30] tommychat55: @Glast1234 ow?
[1:55:34] carryme40: he had flash....
[1:55:42] thurindur: DOTA esport scene in indeed a lot smaller than league. Or better; it's less diverse and more centralised
[1:55:45] Xeraish: Dota is trash, it's fun to play but it does not exist competitively outside of The International
[1:55:46] demiurggermanec247: FeelsBadeMan'
[1:55:48] Zayx13: exactly @Iron_Rice_Bowl G2 ends games in 20 min as maximum
[1:55:51] bradyeli: LCK WAITING ROOM ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:56:02] Sing3d: @S04_kimmrich League is slow by design, you HAVE to sit in lane, or you lose the game, because the exp and gold from minions is insane, specially nowadays with the tower plates
[1:56:05] FireFox167: @tommychat ow LUL dead game
[1:56:08] KaIaxia: @Xeraish Wrong. ( Starladder, The Summit , other majors )
[1:56:14] thurindur: Not exactly true, pro players often have a living purely by getting into the international
[1:56:22] monkhbileg: gg
[1:56:28] kiyoeyoshioka: @TommyChat ???? Does ow and dota have national regions through out all the world, with players getting a salary from riot and the teams ?
[1:56:30] vhakann: KOLAYDI
[1:56:32] Crnlpotato: oh game ended
[1:56:34] tommychat55: @FireFox167 ow is indeed a dead game, ow league however is very much alive
[1:56:37] Crnlpotato: Kappa
[1:56:41] Xeraish: I've watched all of these and it was just a fiesta especially SSummit
[1:56:45] will_o_will: Shanghai Dragon
[1:56:52] thurindur: why should riot pay salaries to pro players?
[1:56:56] fawwazashraf: @thurindur go home or go rich
[1:56:58] Clairfoyance: it is def true that Lol
[1:56:59] thurindur: That's like FIFA paying footballers
[1:57:00] y0ngy0ng: whats LOL international tournament call?
[1:57:01] window7player: same jg everytime...gragas, j4, sej
[1:57:02] kiyoeyoshioka: Like League competitive structure is another level, there are so many regions
[1:57:07] y0ngy0ng: TI? LUL
[1:57:07] tommychat55: @Glast1234 ow has a global league were players get salaries from bliz and teams
[1:57:08] FireFox167: @tommychat if u actually believe that ur insane
[1:57:09] vhakann: KOLAYSINIZ
[1:57:14] thurindur: True @fawwazashraf
[1:57:17] demiurggermanec247: I thought whole Summer split that it would be enough for LGD to play with Pyl to win, oh God I was so delusional LUL
[1:57:20] will_o_will: Neymar will join TSM next seaon
[1:57:23] KaIaxia: @Xeraish Well that's true though , summit is a fiesta because it's a casual tournament. But people watch it because it's fun.
[1:57:30] crystal_kamikaze: @thurindur thats entirely different wtf
[1:57:31] kiyoeyoshioka: @TommyChat They have one league in the US where they call it global full of koreans
[1:57:36] Xeraish: League may be slow but let's be honest every real sports can be boring at some point because there is so much on the line
[1:58:03] fawwazashraf: CS:GO better Kappa
[1:58:09] y0ngy0ng: a few weeks to TI 9 Feelsgoodman
[1:58:11] tommychat55: @Glast1234 it's still a new game, only second year in esport scene, has potential
[1:58:12] crystal_kamikaze: not bowling :)
[1:58:12] thurindur: Like I said; the esport scene in DOTA is alot more centralised around the International, which is amazing during the International but not as alive as League outside of it
[1:58:17] window7player: LEC is much more entertaining
[1:58:43] tommychat55: @Glast1234 i prefer LOL, just saying
[1:58:43] 삼도천심해어: Fortnite Kappa
[1:58:44] kiyoeyoshioka: @TommyChat League is more than the major regions, the wildcard regions has good structure and good views. No other game does have it
[1:58:47] KaIaxia: It's very alive outside the international since teams are trying to qualify for the international via other tournaments.
[1:58:48] thurindur: @crystal_kamikaze It's not exactly different in a legal sense; you can't have the judge also be the owner/payer of salaries
[1:58:53] bradyeli: LEC ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:59:05] stinnytv: Buddy on the left went overboard on the makeup lmao
[1:59:10] kiyoeyoshioka: @TommyChat I know they have potential, but league still far because of diversity
[1:59:14] crystal_kamikaze: @thurindur LOL delusional
[1:59:14] thurindur: Most teams are predictably in the International though
[1:59:22] window7player: LCK ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:59:26] thurindur: @crystal_kamikaze In what sense?
[1:59:34] Sing3d: @thurindur thats not true, its just different, theres a pro circuit with majors, minors etc, you can always see the best teams in the world playing against each other no matter where they come from
[1:59:37] thurindur: @crystal_kamikaze we're both talking about Riot paying salaries right?
[1:59:38] 삼도천심해어: Minecraft > league Keepo
[1:59:46] KaIaxia: True , but isn't it the same in league? there's always skt , tsm , fnatic
[1:59:48] demiurggermanec247: 4Head I HAVE NO BRAINS 4Head I HAVE NO SKILL 4Head YOU GUESSED IT RIGHT 4Head I'M LGD PYL 4Head
[1:59:58] bradyeli: LEC WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:00:08] tommychat55: @Glast1234 League is far above everything ofc
[2:00:17] thurindur: @Sing3d You're probably right, it's been a while for me since I followed DOTA
[2:00:21] kiyoeyoshioka: @Sing3d The league circuit is the best for stability on long term, where you can have diversity from regions though out the world.
[2:00:30] Crnlpotato: i miss ekko
[2:00:42] kiyoeyoshioka: You can make the game popular even in Japan where they don't even like moba
[2:01:00] Xeraish: In DotA you have buybacks, sick comeback mechanics and heroes who require no skill at all. Teams are always throwing and feeding non stop. It's fun but very chaotic and can't be taken seriously. I've played and watched DotA for 5 years btw :)
[2:01:06] demiurggermanec247: When was the last time Maokai appeared in top leagues?
[2:01:16] CuteIing: in Japan they dont like pc gaming overall
[2:01:18] tommychat55: @KaIaxia SKT and TSM didnt even make Worlds 2018
[2:01:40] KaIaxia: @Xeraish and there's decisions where you don't use your buyback.
[2:01:43] kiyoeyoshioka: @CuteIing The league comunity in japan is raising with the LJL
[2:01:50] KaIaxia: @TommyChat I haven't watched worlds for years , didn't know that.
[2:01:50] thurindur: @Xeraish makes no sense lol, these mechanics are the same for every participating player which makes it competitive again
[2:02:16] thurindur: @Xeraish it's perhaps the case in lower tiers but they're definitely not throwing when there are millions of dollars on the line
[2:02:20] kiyoeyoshioka: When the play-in teams starting to be more competitive we'll have a true wolrd cup of league and it'll be sane
[2:02:28] soul1347: kids game
[2:02:54] 삼도천심해어: league b01 bracket OMEGALUL
[2:03:07] FireFox167: Dota is trash u could face roll ur keyboard and still win
[2:03:11] Xeraish: It's not since heroes and mechanics are totally imbalanced. A buyback on Storm or Spectre easily wins you a game
[2:03:18] Sing3d: LUL
[2:03:20] tommychat55: @Glast1234 the problem is that play in regions, are in general smaller economies than the main regions
[2:03:44] 삼도천심해어: even singsing from playing lol back to dota Keepo

[2:05:29] panela_sr: Imagine talking about the game that copy LoL LUL

[2:05:41] Sing3d: @Xeraish the game is so unbalanced you can see over 100 heroes being played on the sametournament ;)
[2:05:42] kiyoeyoshioka: @TommyChat The players are bad mechanically, soloq is trash and theres is no discipline sadly.
[2:05:43] NocturnVenomKRYP: Like 9-1 in msi?

[4:00:14] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: GRF and IG biggest upsets of the year LUL
[4:00:16] tsmfansrdelusional: TheShy either gets ahead or ints, same with Ning, these guys don't know the fundamentals of league, or they neglect it, because they do this way to often to be a coincidence
[4:00:19] cristianke: who won?

[4:02:42] teemo5519: Tian POG
[4:02:47] slickjavel: can only knock up one?
[4:02:56] carryme40: WUNDER IS ONE FOR SURE, I WOULD SAY BOTH TOP AND FPX's top laners are the other two. and that is before i even mention lck's top laners
[4:03:31] dmonblu: FPX has superior skills to every other teams
[4:03:48] GN_Paradox: holy fuck tien is a god
[4:04:02] teemo5519: POG
[4:04:06] mattaru: Tian is top 3 JG .

[4:04:21] Lantogh: loved this
[4:04:26] dmonblu: A team that relies solely on mechanics will never win anything
[4:04:39] carryme40: AND I WOULD SAY IMPACT IS CURRENTLY PLAYING BETTER THAN THESHYT.
[4:04:42] dmonblu: Less the other teams choke of course LUL

[4:05:20] dmonblu: @GN_Paradox U dont watch LPL often do u? There is a reason why FPX always chokes when it matters LUL
[4:05:31] dmonblu: They rely solely on mechanics to win game
[4:05:56] goblinguy01: IG, don't let Ning int Kappa
[4:06:00] LmaoLp: TL, aka "Total Losers", is the current #1 NA team. Despite being based in NA, they are made up of 4 Asians and 1 EU. They are especially known for the fastest BO5 loss internationally.
[4:06:13] Bugattiz644: ig 2-1
[4:06:16] Lantogh: @Nibiria thank you very much
[4:06:29] vicviper: LUL LPL is in a bad shape now with RNG and IG like this
[4:06:43] carryme40: rng ?
[4:06:45] dmonblu: W/o macro and tactics not matter how good a team is they just cant win anything
[4:06:49] carryme40: they are 9-2....
[4:06:51] 풍미모락: TriHard
[4:06:53] goblinguy01: I can say the same for NA and LCK
[4:06:55] HystericsCasts: I was made for this
[4:06:55] willwill2018: The shy is still here, but his style would easily be ganked if the Jungle can’t do anything
[4:06:59] carryme40: if 9-2 is playing bad.....
[4:07:09] GN_Paradox: @dmonblu nah i've seen them last split aswell, they arent only mechanicall team, that is the most bullshit thing've heared. its their insane champ pools and game knowledge aswell as mechanics to execute on their strat that makes them so good.
[4:07:10] tyree_sanada: rescHi rescHi rescHi
[4:07:12] CuteIing: feels like level of play dropped across all regions but especially in lpl
