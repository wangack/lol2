[3:36:31] KaIaxia: @zandelcorrin True , you can 1 v 5 but it requires high skill level. An Immortal ranked player with Invoker ( arguably the hardest hero in all MOBAs ) can kill 5 heralds alone.

[3:38:35] Sing3d: @window7player I didnt say that Invoker is easy, I said that Meepo is harder to play than Invoker for most players
[3:38:36] tempore420: @SimplyNextGen its still more than lol gives. man just use math, lol world prize pool is 5 milion. dota ti prize pool is 20+ milion. now add all dota majors and minors and you get over 30+ milion
[3:38:38] zandelcorrin: @KaIaxia As someone who has played both I can assure you that competitive level play in Dota 2 is much easier than LoL.
[3:38:39] hyourinni: @BestIZedIZimbabwe Hemoplay

[3:40:25] zandelcorrin: @KaIaxia Not the same team roster tho, the org has won but not the same players. Guess Dota doesn't have a good org like that. The downside to less viewers and sponsors I guess.
[3:40:28] tempore420: @frozen_ashe what it's from then? paycheck? you know lol players complained ( especiALLY FORMER ONES WHO CAN SPEAK NOW ) HOW LOW riota pays them actually

[3:40:51] SimplyNextGen: @bajic91lp but thats the main prize to one team if you was to take that out and then just add the smaller events lol would have paid more and supported there smaller teams more then dota do, there are dota pro players that have gone to lol because the money is better for smaller teams and more stable if you dont win TI or not top 5 teams your team is going to be broke
[3:40:56] chibogtaba: less sponsor $31 million prize pool lmao
