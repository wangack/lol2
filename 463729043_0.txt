[1:31:37] cryptori: SKT 1-5, win 10 in a row. JAG 0-15? you think JAG "miraculously" wins EVERY RELEGATION and then SKT COINCIDENTALLY plays them when they need a boost in standings

[1:35:31] cryptori: @hermeneutist we arent talking about match fixing with comms. read up and see my LCK comment. 0-15 JAG ALWAYS win relegations, ALWAYS play SKT at the PERFECT time to boost them in standings. Those type of things arent deciding exact matches or throws, but they are there to help the big teams continue to be big

[2:20:38] cryptori: I love both, but @demiurggermanec247 when it comes to auto-chess is a direct copy pasta even my buddies who play LoL daily and TFT agree. and they are so biased against dota so its confirmed
[2:20:46] babalew: I wanna see Vici vs Jin Air, 2 goat teams
[2:20:48] RVxReaper: @rattybag those people who made the custom map made dota 2 -_-

[2:22:54] demiurggermanec247: @BruceJenna okay I believe you, I just never olayed any autobattler. And I'm pretty convinced that either Riot stole the idea from Underlords when it was in creation, or both companies made it at the same time, dates of release are just two weeks different
[2:22:55] ruavjp: zzzzzzzzz
[2:23:15] hermeneutist: vlad again
[2:23:17] demiurggermanec247: Can't say anything about autochess ofc

[2:23:41] cryptori: Underlords was in production WELL before TFT
[2:23:42] hermeneutist: underlords is a lot better-designed than TFT
[2:23:49] cryptori: ^
[2:24:06] hermeneutist: UI looks so much better, even a non-dota player like me can learn it in a few games
[2:24:19] cryptori: go look at the other auto chesses, then look at TFT. TFT looks slopped together in a 3 week period
[2:24:34] hermeneutist: it actually is lmao

[2:26:48] perfectrotation7: vici has out drafted and outplayed LNG to a freakin T and still lost

[3:10:17] theviper12: TL can 1st place in LPL

[3:10:22] hermeneutist: i think JDG v LGD is more boringer
[3:10:26] demiurggermanec247: @goblibguy01 if Griffin are in gauntlet, who are top 2 from LCK?
[3:10:28] TastyAMG: @Dendenyoshi Is there a English channel for that?
[3:10:38] TastyAMG: because i really want to see those 2 teams play
[3:10:40] theviper12: IG was defeated by TL LUL LPL is a joke

[3:11:09] Dendenyoshi: @TastyVR As far as i know, i havent found one if there is
[3:11:17] TastyAMG: i wish League had more tournaments so we could know who truly is the best team
[3:11:28] BestIZedIZimbabwe: Man I'm really excited for Worlds. S8 Worlds was insane. I hope S9 worlds will be even better.
[3:11:30] TastyAMG: @Dendenyoshi Okay that's kinda unlucky. Thanks for the help though
[3:11:33] demiurggermanec247: TFW you haven't seen a single game form ohso hyped G2

[3:12:31] demiurggermanec247: EU is too late for me, it is 3 pm for me right now
[3:12:33] sdimi95: @adadadaw do you really belive that c9 is better than rng and dwg? or that clg is better than fnc?
[3:12:37] Ryn4r: G2 overhated
[3:12:38] demiurggermanec247: So I watch asia
[3:12:49] NahtewOCE: @adadadaw i can't watch a lot of NA due to timezone but that sounds right to me but FPX over TL and FNC is maybe too low imo
[3:13:09] TastyAMG: @BestIZedIZimbabwe i dont believe that. people can over perform or under perform on the day. if there were more tournaments then i feel like we would have a better idea who the best teams are.
[3:13:12] BestIZedIZimbabwe: Imagine living in a country where it isn't 13:14 right now LUL LUL LUL
[3:13:13] Ludboi: @adadadaw 3 NA in top 10 ? bias
[3:13:14] kenovell: saying g2 you mean team caps LUL
[3:13:16] Barushko: demiurggermanec247 it's 1pm in EU, the difference is pretty small, no?

[3:13:37] 島輝7: <3 <3 <3

[3:14:14] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @tastyvr partly true I agree, but we can say whoever wins Worlds is the best team in the world RIGHT NOW.

[3:14:19] perfectrotation7: @Dendenyoshi i actually agree with you. korea can have 100T LUL LUL

[3:14:35] Dendenyoshi: LUL
[3:14:37] demiurggermanec247: Moreover, G2 are always late
[3:14:44] MIBR_IS_OVERRATED: LUL if lng drop this they're out of playoffs
[3:14:55] demiurggermanec247: 3rd game of the day is already too late
[3:14:59] Maxzzie: Who is casting?
[3:15:01] Zynos_AT: @TastyVR 👍
[3:15:01] goblinguy01: Griffin has 0% or 10% chance to make it worlds. I hope KZ make it, so LCK doesn't roll over
[3:15:02] TastyAMG: @BestIZedIZimbabwe Yeah for a month maybe, but just because G2 was the best team on the day at MSI doesn't mean they are the best team now. hopefully the way i described that makes sense
[3:15:07] demiurggermanec247: and they are always 3rd or later
[3:15:08] WenceTheMagi: 🤔🤔
