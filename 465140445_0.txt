[0:53:14] la7041831: it is delay
[0:54:37] will_o_will: guess they will skip first series when RNG and IG match begins
[0:55:14] thelastheroinuyashiki: Lol poor things
[0:55:37] thelastheroinuyashiki: They will skip for sure
[0:57:02] babbols: Why is this delay by an hour?
[0:57:44] HystericsCasts: Due to the Typhoon the games in Hangzhou are delayed
[0:58:04] fridaychill: makes sense

[1:20:49] apumaTV: Rng vs IG monkaS
[1:22:53] hentailover12345: wait what? why is the match delayed by 1 hour?
[1:26:37] 21044275: So uh, will they be casting the LGD game or the RNG game?
[1:26:48] NarutoEU: RNG LUL
[1:26:52] bumazzwolf: both
[1:27:20] 21044275: If they don't do RNG game live Imma have to go watch the Chinese stream
[1:27:29] 21044275: I just can't stand the Chinese casters and their 0 game knowledge
[1:29:36] NarutoEU: Kreygasm time for Rookie to destroy RNG Kreygasm
[1:32:01] razlol: wait why is chat in slow mode
[1:32:19] 21044275: Mr. Raz will you be casting the RNG game live?
[1:32:22] razlol: yeah
[1:32:28] 21044275: Thank goodness
[1:32:34] razlol: 2nd series casted live 100%
[1:32:36] 21044275: Don't want to watch Chinese stream
[1:32:55] NarutoEU: @Razleplasm Who u got ? IG or RNG ?
[1:33:15] razlol: I have RNG before seeing rosters. IG after seeing rosters. The ultimate flip flop
[1:33:43] 21044275: Pretty sure Karsa will demolish Ning, even when Ning is at his best he isn't as good as Karsa
[1:33:58] razlol: Ning not playing though. Leyan in.
[1:34:03] NarutoEU: @21044275 Ning will subbed out according to news
[1:34:07] 21044275: Oh really?
[1:34:19] razlol: yea, academy jungler, he's good
[1:34:33] sqradi: if leyan destroys karsa we will probably not see rng make worlds
[1:34:44] sqradi: karsa will never recover being destroyed by a rookie
[1:35:02] 21044275: Yeah Karsa is a very tilt player, still remember his Taliyah ult
[1:35:14] razlol: it wont be that bad, they just need someone to not hard int away lane leads
[1:35:33] NarutoEU: Jungler is the least worry for me. Its either can Uzi/Ming snow ball early, or will Rookie/TheShy take over the game.
[1:36:15] NarutoEU: Karsa will be camping that bot 24/7. I pray for RNG top laners.
[1:36:37] NarutoEU: @The_Most_Interesting_Guy IG or FPX
[1:36:56] toodlele: late start?
[1:37:16] cutiecat88: lgd rng waiting room ResidentSleeper
[1:37:19] 21044275: IG is doing very bad
[1:37:25] 21044275: IG is in danger of not making playoffs
[1:37:34] NarutoEU: doesn't matter. if none can stop IG in playoffs, or will FPX finally win after dominating regular split
[1:37:40] luccid: TriHard 7
[1:37:51] toodlele: Where's duke?
[1:37:56] fridaychill: I'm putting my money on RNG at least 85% of the time
[1:37:59] rebetc: let's go IG
[1:38:07] Jenabellaa: rng vs ig hype
[1:38:07] JAG_Blanc: delayed start?
[1:38:08] Carstik: Duke FeelsBadMan
[1:38:17] fridaychill: yeah
[1:38:20] toodlele: What heppned to duke?
[1:38:23] JAG_Blanc: why delay
[1:38:26] fridaychill: there is a typhoon
[1:38:36] 21044275: Typhoon in Shanghai?
[1:38:41] toodlele: @KR_WORST_REGION so does everyteam
[1:39:24] llxavir4: sond please ?
[1:39:38] llxavir4: sound please*
[1:39:52] fridaychill: just for the first game as I understand
[1:40:20] sqradi: ning swimming in cash and girls he doesnt giv a fk anymore
[1:40:27] fridaychill: Are they finally subbing out ning?
[1:40:33] CYBERBOOLI__xD: SourPls
[1:41:01] fridaychill: Ning has been so terrible i mean but so has theshy for the most part
[1:41:02] sqradi: if they win with leyan i doubt they will sub him our for nint LUL
[1:41:19] fridaychill: ^
[1:41:32] fridaychill: At IG's high's he will be insane
[1:41:47] fridaychill: but from what I've seen it's not looking great for IG
[1:42:10] sqradi: ^ agree
[1:42:45] fridaychill: yeah true but I'd still put money on LPL
[1:42:45] sqradi: ning distracting the fact that rookie has been very mediocre
[1:43:03] fridaychill: Rookie is okay now
[1:43:19] fridaychill: not as much of a trainwreck from early in the split
[1:43:32] kylldeth: Rookie might be mediocre, but Ning has been absolutely abyssmal at times, which is inexcusable
[1:43:35] sqradi: eh from the last few games idk
[1:43:51] fridaychill: oh did you see the early split from IG?
[1:44:01] fridaychill: they would lose to OMG now that's how bad they played
[1:44:03] kylldeth: this music is DansGame
[1:44:12] sqradi: he went from a trainwreck to mediocre
[1:44:34] fridaychill: they still have a small potential to be good
[1:44:40] kylldeth: gachiBASS
[1:44:58] fridaychill: but subbing out Rookie basically shows too much
[1:45:00] storzu: Guys is Ig still can go to Worlds?
[1:45:12] fridaychill: I really can't say
[1:45:15] G58N: what? did they bench rookie?
[1:45:29] fridaychill: No rookie is not benched
[1:45:37] fridaychill: I'm just hypothetically speaking
[1:45:42] storzu: @KR_WORST_REGION but they got still chance if gonna win all matcherS?
[1:45:47] G58N: god bless, this one is match of a month
[1:46:09] fridaychill: IG winning a ton now I wouldn't count on it
[1:46:35] fridaychill: IG is too inconsistent
[1:46:49] storzu: @KR_WORST_REGION i want to bet on Ig vs Rng i think they gonna try hard and win ;d
[1:47:01] fridaychill: it shows they kinda haven't grown anywhere
[1:47:26] fridaychill: if anything they are declining to an extent
[1:47:26] sqradi: rng actually dont have too big of an incentive to win
[1:47:40] sqradi: the best spot to be is 4th rn
[1:47:41] hermeneutist: why is LGD BLG starting late?
[1:47:42] fnask10: LGD wins this one
[1:47:46] sqradi: to avoid edg ig tes
[1:48:05] stevesrh: a hurricane is hitting shanghai so the game was delayed
[1:48:17] fridaychill: I mean RNG can highly likely win all of them
[1:48:29] fridaychill: maybe Tes I'd be more iffy on
[1:48:30] LeMassiveNoob: probably not an unpopular opinion, but I would be less surprised if BLG or Suning make it to Worlds over iG
[1:48:50] storzu: So what happen to IG they were so strong;/
[1:49:05] fridaychill: they just can't do any macro
[1:49:10] fnask10: RNG isnt actually that good, langx is a potato
[1:49:15] fridaychill: mid game from them is either win or loss
[1:49:24] hermeneutist: holy heck delayed cos of hurricane monkaS
[1:49:39] lunarwolffff: LUL
[1:49:41] sqradi: rng forever 4v5 LUL
[1:49:47] fridaychill: IG also has no cohesiveness in the game
[1:49:51] yudai95: chat whos the better region: LPL or LCK?
[1:49:57] fridaychill: RNG don't need to bank on Langx
[1:50:08] SmashBob_SquarePants: IM DRUNK
[1:50:10] byfat: @yudai95 Lck of course
[1:50:14] fridaychill: Karsa is a god damn monster and Jackeylove is basically 1v4
[1:50:33] SmashBob_SquarePants: howcome IG was so doinating in MSI but not now
[1:50:33] toodlele: @fridaychill Karsa been shitting since fw days
[1:50:41] SmashBob_SquarePants: im out of it eli5
[1:51:02] lunarwolffff: monkaS
[1:51:12] fnask10: @byfat lck kinda suck pretty hard right now.
[1:51:14] fridaychill: Karsa is smurfing on RNG wdym?
[1:51:22] Cinamo2: Looking at rift rivals lck is better by far
[1:51:34] Cinamo2: But they’re so slowwwww
[1:51:42] SmashBob_SquarePants: jin air > G2???
[1:51:43] fridaychill: Lck is the place where no one adapts and the meta is probably not figured out the most
[1:52:03] yudai95: JAG > G2 > SKT
[1:52:18] toodlele: have you watched the games; Karsa single handedly lost them the game vs tes
[1:52:26] lunarwolffff: They are so excited
[1:52:40] fridaychill: Have you watched RNG this split?
[1:52:59] Cinamo2: Yea I agree the meta in lck is corki azir mid and that’s pretty much it aatrox too
[1:53:02] fridaychill: did you watch RNG last year?
[1:53:11] toodlele: yea he also screwed langx over by doing that verticle jgling against jax
[1:53:15] lunarwolffff: "single handedly" @toodlele you know thats not true
[1:53:29] fnask10: Things have changed since RR. SKT winning every game becuase every other team sucks, they are honestly not even looking that good imo. KZ looked good at RR and they are horrible now. LCK was obviously better at RR but they suck now, league is weird.
[1:53:46] toodlele: @lunarwolffff it's true; He fked up so bad on ults and got out jgled by tes
[1:53:58] fridaychill: Langx was never the person they played around
[1:54:01] Quakkulol: MingLee
[1:54:03] Cinamo2: @fnaskpojkenx SKT is on a 9 game winning streak
[1:54:12] irvingwellsjr: I’m waiting for the next match later today RNG vs IG
[1:54:18] hermeneutist: RNG lost game 3 TES from draft
[1:54:21] fridaychill: it's obvious it's still Mr Uzi show with a great Xiaohu finally
[1:54:24] lunarwolffff: @toodlele What about Xiaohu who got abused all 3 games by Knight?
[1:54:50] fridaychill: Also Tes aren't even bad?
[1:55:00] toodlele: @lunarwolffff there's a reason he got abused; TES jg was on top of shit
[1:55:02] fridaychill: IG is a joke now
[1:55:02] hermeneutist: TES are actually damned good lmao
[1:55:05] sqradi: u cant blame xiaohu being abused by knight... knight is a prodigy
[1:55:09] Cinamo2: Isn’t TES top 4?
[1:55:15] fridaychill: ^
[1:55:19] hermeneutist: they're top 2
[1:55:27] jinhyun: ig vs rng waiting room ResidentSleeper
[1:55:30] toodlele: @lunarwolffff Karsa literally cant adapted; Tes did the same pathing and Karsa just let it happned
[1:55:36] hermeneutist: RNG is trying to knock them off into 3rd; but i don't think they can do it
[1:55:39] toodlele: Tes first to top
[1:55:49] toodlele: Karsa was always late
[1:55:51] TheAdjusting: There should be mic checks before LEC too
[1:56:03] Cinamo2: there is lmao
[1:56:09] fridaychill: rng isn't a topside team though
[1:56:12] lunarwolffff: @toodlele That's not how i remember the series, in fact Knight was often 1v2 in the mid lane
[1:56:38] fridaychill: I never saw the game thank you for helping @lunarwolffff <3
[1:56:41] toodlele: @lunarwolffff you should rewatch
[1:56:52] toodlele: @lunarwolffff look at all 3 games first ganks by Tes
[1:57:01] Cinamo2: The meta rn is so all over the place
[1:57:03] toodlele: @lunarwolffff Karsa doesn't learn
[1:57:15] fridaychill: Meta isn't so all over the place
[1:57:21] fridaychill: it's kinda solid
[1:57:26] fridaychill: with some flexibility
[1:57:27] Cinamo2: Throughout regions
[1:57:28] fnask10: TES had 3.6 odds against RNG lmao, made bank on that series
[1:57:42] toodlele: @lunarwolffff he's not adaptive; and not proactive enough vs other jglers
[1:57:50] mattaru: why is the game so late? :/
[1:57:53] toodlele: at least against likes of Tes and FPx
[1:57:58] mattaru: shouldn't it have started an hour ago
[1:58:07] fridaychill: I think most shit is pretty solid, like Renekton, GP Akali and so on
[1:58:07] storzu: @fnaskpojkenx you think is worth to bet on IG 2.6 odds?:D
[1:58:27] fridaychill: Typhoon*
[1:58:31] mattaru: @KR_WORST_REGION oh yah thx
[1:58:32] fridaychill: a bit worse
[1:58:41] Cinamo2: Only thing solid I’ve seen is aatrox corki and azir and I watch every region
[1:58:41] mattaru: yeah crazy typhoon season here
[1:58:44] Sing3d: VoHiYo
[1:59:00] fridaychill: I try and watch every region too
[1:59:04] Sing3d: 5 seconds monkaS
[1:59:09] fridaychill: we can discuss if you want
[1:59:14] fnask10: I've got IG at 3. I think the odds are too high yeah I think everyone is overrating RNG a bit
[1:59:56] fridaychill: yeah it's very yikes
[2:00:02] sqradi: where did it hit?
[2:00:43] lunarwolffff: Hard to take iG seriously after MSI
[2:00:51] lunarwolffff: I'm trying but it's hard
[2:00:59] sqradi: oof
[2:01:01] hermeneutist: Typhoon Lekima

[2:08:39] Sing3d: Uzi is still 22 or 23?
[2:09:06] Cinamo2: Only OGs remember Star Horn Royal Club I think it was called
[2:09:18] fridaychill: ^

[2:12:59] xqf052: need to go to playoff first
[2:13:02] Sing3d: VoHiYo
[2:13:12] Cinamo2: Pairing Teddy with Mata who has so much experience was like the best idea ever imagine how better Teddy got after spring split
[2:13:31] achesquared: LUL
[2:13:37] Rudiko: @scottofl2014 AH yes GRIEFfin, Masters of the choke
[2:13:49] scottoflorida2014: Teddy with Zayzel would go 10/0/10 every game
[2:13:52] hermeneutist: Gentle Reliable Farmers
[2:13:53] Sing3d: SKT is losing against HLE monkaS
[2:14:01] scottoflorida2014: GRF is LCK's TSM
[2:14:07] Cinamo2: SKT draft is horrible again
[2:14:38] Cinamo2: They drafted Quinn? Top?
[2:14:54] Rudiko: @scottofl2014 hey at least tsm has won some championships
[2:15:12] Rudiko: @scottofl2014 more like immortals
[2:15:18] scottoflorida2014: True, LCS championships are the most prized ones to win too
[2:15:21] Sing3d: ResidentSleeper
[2:15:22] lunarwolffff: Kramer is gonna show up today
[2:15:23] Cinamo2: TSM is doomed for playoffs
[2:15:29] scottoflorida2014: Dignitas returning in 2020 PogChamp
[2:15:44] Cinamo2: Idk about that
[2:15:51] fridaychill: azir first pick???
[2:16:02] fridaychill: this draft is something else
[2:16:04] Cinamo2: Clutch got New Jersey’s so idk if they’re gonna keep the name clutch gaming
[2:16:13] scottoflorida2014: Dignitas bought CG PogChamp
[2:16:21] achesquared: picking Sylus into Olaf LUL
[2:16:23] hermeneutist: quinn is paying off a bit
[2:16:24] scottoflorida2014: Yeah they didnt say if they were or not
[2:16:36] Cinamo2: Cuz why get new yellow jerseys if the split is gonna end you know? Doesn’t make sense
[2:16:58] scottoflorida2014: Rick Fox got screwed by Riot and EF partners. Hopefully he finds a new home in LCS
[2:17:15] bbqriceroll: LUL LCS LUL
[2:17:31] Cinamo2: Fenix is getting echo fox slot I think
[2:17:31] hermeneutist: collector's items
[2:17:39] hermeneutist: clutch might be selling spot right?
[2:17:48] fnask10: SKT losing early 3/3 teams against HLE.. It's obvious that LCK sucks atm and only reason SKT keeps winning is because every single team in entire LCK besides SKT has been shit since RR except for Damwon for like 3 weeks
[2:17:49] scottoflorida2014: Its already sold to Dignitas
[2:17:52] silenlg: There are still 42 mins from the beginning of LPL Spring Festival ! Who is " comfortable" at the time ? We still wait and see! LUL
[2:17:54] scottoflorida2014: from wha I understand
[2:18:08] StokesAKAShrek: ya
[2:18:21] StokesAKAShrek: dig and imt are both coming back
[2:18:24] scottoflorida2014: Nice to see Mike " Dont call me Mike Yeung" Yeung playing again
[2:18:26] fridaychill: Isn't quinn a pick against Renekton?
[2:18:30] scottoflorida2014: IMT are too?
[2:18:35] StokesAKAShrek: ya
[2:18:36] Cinamo2: Idk I’d say it’s more of a draft issue from SKT it’s where they’ve struggled worse
[2:18:48] fridaychill: ^true
[2:18:50] soundpraenk: @fnaskpojkenx that's why Damwon got rekt by Africa, right? LUL
[2:18:51] storzu: skt still gonna win vs lucian rene in late..
[2:18:54] StokesAKAShrek: pretty sure its cg and optic that are leaving
[2:18:58] Cinamo2: Also HLE Key is such a good support rn wouldn’t be surprised if he was doing shotcalling
[2:19:02] hermeneutist: because khan and faker don't have much overlap in champ pool
[2:19:04] scottoflorida2014: That was partly owned by Linkin Park
[2:19:08] soundpraenk: @fnaskpojkenx and HLE, sry i forgot it :D
[2:19:09] Sing3d: old man PYL has to play point and click champions Kappa
[2:19:25] hermeneutist: all the strong teams have at least some solid overlap in top/mid pools
[2:19:55] scottoflorida2014: The money involved now WutFace
[2:19:58] hermeneutist: and they usually draft for at least one of the solo lanes to be able to win in lane
[2:20:01] Cinamo2: Idk if LCK teams suck rn or if it’s more like the gap between the teams is closing cuz imagine if it’s that then lck would slap in worlds
[2:20:29] fnask10: @Arnej35 Damwon sucks now, I said they played good after RR. Learn to read and you'll look less stupid
[2:20:51] StokesAKAShrek: lck is an absolute shit show at the top rn
[2:21:00] xqf052: is that a frog?
[2:21:01] hermeneutist: wait, this is lpl chat right
[2:21:04] fridaychill: I don't really think lck team can take more than 1 game of lec and lcs teams in groups
[2:21:09] hermeneutist: why aren't we talking about the game
[2:21:16] thwersz: lgd can f5?
[2:21:22] Cinamo2: Lol
[2:21:23] StokesAKAShrek: theres nothing going on rn
[2:21:26] soundpraenk: @fnaskpojkenx LCK is not shit, you are going to be proved very wrong at Worlds :P
[2:21:41] scottoflorida2014: Its BLG LGD Kind of like last place OCE teams PogChamp
[2:21:42] fridaychill: I don't think so
[2:21:44] hermeneutist: kuro vs kramer - AF civil war
[2:21:57] achesquared: what patch is this
[2:22:09] sqradi: !patch
[2:22:09] Moobot: @roqtt This is patch 9.14
[2:22:11] scottoflorida2014: 9.14 still ?
[2:22:12] silenlg: Beijing Time 7pm : RNG fans vs IG fans Don't forget it 4Head
[2:22:13] Cinamo2: Look lck is not trash you’re right but against NA and LEC who don’t play as clean and formulating they’re the early game is gonna be wild and idk if lck is ready for that
[2:22:28] xqf052: why does the game start late today?
[2:22:40] kurotsuchii_: idk lck other than skt looks shaky rn
[2:22:45] scottoflorida2014: Yeah it was 2 hours later than usual
[2:22:46] kurotsuchii_: and even today skt lost a game to HLE
[2:22:54] fridaychill: I don't think lck teams can play the game as it's supposed to be right now
[2:22:59] scottoflorida2014: or 1 hour
[2:23:01] fnask10: Maybe things change again in a few weeks. LCK right now is a shit show. If worlds was played today then both EU and LPL would place better
[2:23:09] kurotsuchii_: ^
[2:23:22] Sing3d: its the patch 9.15
[2:23:25] hermeneutist: super typhoon lekima caused delay
[2:23:28] Sing3d: the bot is outdated
[2:23:28] StokesAKAShrek: id argue that tl and possibly c9 would also do better
[2:23:29] soundpraenk: @fnaskpojkenx it's not, observe LCK better and you'll look less stupid :)
[2:23:35] kurotsuchii_: yeah like at rift rivals lck looked really strong but know its fiesta
[2:23:40] kurotsuchii_: *now
[2:23:41] scottoflorida2014: Its a given than NA will win Worlds but can LCK surpass LEC and LPL, that is the unknown papas200IQ
[2:23:48] fridaychill: @Arnej35 you know he's 100% right
[2:24:02] hermeneutist: also, it's rift rivals... hard to tell if everyone was fully committing their best strats
[2:24:06] Cinamo2: Idk RR can only lead us to think lck is better and when we’re talking about EU it’s not really EU it’s G2 and the rest of LEC
[2:24:17] Cinamo2: LEC teams do have different play styles
[2:24:20] kurotsuchii_: china and korea take RR very seriously
[2:24:25] fridaychill: I mean FNC can have strong games
[2:24:39] scottoflorida2014: G2 RNG GRF Each regions version of TSM at Worlds
[2:24:52] kurotsuchii_: fnc have strong games then they have a game like today where hyli is just running it down
[2:25:00] fridaychill: ^
[2:25:08] soundpraenk: @fridaychill im pretty confident KR team takes first place, EU is bad rn too imo, only G2 is able to do something and still i dont think they can win
[2:25:41] fridaychill: I think you aren't valuing Eu teams because of history more than analysis from this year
[2:25:45] kurotsuchii_: idk g2 is really scary in 5 games who knows how many crazy strats they have
[2:25:53] Cinamo2: The thing is when you are placed in a region with G2 you learn a lot of things wheras LCK is all kind of the same play style so
[2:26:01] kurotsuchii_: only team with crazy shit like them is FPX
[2:26:27] scottoflorida2014: ID still stands on top till they are taken down at Worlds PogChamp
[2:26:30] scottoflorida2014: IG
[2:26:31] StokesAKAShrek: lck is still playing too slow while the rest of the world has faster game times
[2:26:37] fridaychill: FPX is the closest to G2 you can come I think and even FPX has better midlane
[2:26:39] ケイザー: sorry I just got here, why is this still in game 1? rng was scheduled an hour from now
[2:26:50] kurotsuchii_: weather issue
[2:26:53] kurotsuchii_: delayed the game
[2:27:05] ケイザー: ah thank you
[2:27:10] fridaychill: Talk to Lekima
[2:27:26] 21044275: RNG vs IG in 30 minutes
[2:27:34] sqradi: typhoon Ligma monkaS
[2:27:39] 21044275: I haven't slept for nearly 20 hours
[2:27:41] Cinamo2: G2 is good but the thing is they’re so confident and just used to being ahead where if you match them early on and put them behind you’ll win cuz after that caps pretty much ints
[2:28:04] ケイザー: wait rng is still in 30 minutes @21044275
[2:28:06] fridaychill: that's is if he's craps
[2:28:08] ケイザー: ??
[2:28:22] sqradi: yes
[2:28:23] 21044275: Yeah I just checked Douyu
[2:28:26] 21044275: starts at 1900
[2:28:31] StokesAKAShrek: skt just lost to hle
[2:28:32] Sing3d: SKT LUL
[2:28:34] StokesAKAShrek: 2-1
[2:28:38] kurotsuchii_: rip skt LUL
[2:28:39] fridaychill: G2 usually don't have a lead early but in midgame they are insane
[2:28:46] Cinamo2: Wow HLE beat SKT rip streak
[2:28:50] sqradi: SKT OMEGALUL
[2:28:52] ケイザー: will it be separate stream or what, what's going to happen to this series
[2:28:53] 21044275: Wtf?
[2:28:54] YakHerd: anyone know why this series is delayed?
[2:28:54] hermeneutist: hahahahhahaa SKT
[2:28:57] scottoflorida2014: HLE beats DWG and SKT LUL
[2:29:01] Cinamo2: If SKT won 2-0 they secured playoffs
[2:29:12] 21044275: How is it possible to go on a massive winstreak to lose to the second worst team in the league
[2:29:19] Cinamo2: HLE escapes relegations by beating the top 2 teams lol
[2:29:21] hermeneutist: HLE gonna get out of relegation zone rip KT
[2:29:24] alexis00777: hle won
[2:29:31] scottoflorida2014: KT BibleThump
[2:29:41] Sing3d: JAG BibleThump
[2:29:42] StokesAKAShrek: to be fair HLE also beat DWG
[2:29:43] Cinamo2: Someone got to pick up HLE key this guy is so good
[2:30:03] scottoflorida2014: Key signs with TSM Kappa
[2:30:17] kurotsuchii_: key has been insane since EVER days
[2:30:19] mattaru: LUL SKT CLAPPED BY HLE
[2:30:19] Cinamo2: TSM is so doomed for playoffs lol
[2:30:21] kurotsuchii_: hes really toxic tho
[2:30:24] yudai95: FAKER LUL FAKER FANS OMEGALUL FAKER HATERS Pog
[2:30:24] YSZN: skt was decent in game 3 playing to their win condition, hle made the correct gambles and out executed. LCK strong as usual
[2:30:27] scottoflorida2014: TSM is toast
[2:30:38] Cinamo2: @optimustaco Lol is he actually toxic
[2:30:41] goblinguy01: IG vs. RNG 4Head
[2:30:41] hermeneutist: DWG and SKT conspiring to sabotage KT
[2:30:58] mattaru: IG vs RNG waiting room, plz quick 2-0 BLG
[2:31:01] scottoflorida2014: Faker will end up in OPL playing for Legacy
[2:31:09] Sing3d: LUL
[2:31:10] StokesAKAShrek: tsm is actually going to lose to cg today
[2:31:12] nujabes_val: kramer
[2:31:13] sqradi: they will skip to ig rng dont worry
[2:31:16] chitnyi1993: HLE WON PogChamp
[2:31:17] s0naut: 4 people around Jinjiao and they dont focus him LUL
[2:31:21] mattaru: @KR_WORST_REGION YESSSSSSSSSS
[2:31:21] 魔女王女: Shouldn't this be RNG vs IG soon ? was there are delay ?
[2:31:21] hk18810186: skt t4
[2:31:30] narvuntien: balls I am going to be too busy to watch IG vs RNG :(
[2:31:36] R11David: Skip this match pls
[2:31:42] narvuntien: Looks like BLG is going to make play offs this time
[2:31:46] asheeiii: SKT LUL
[2:31:48] scottoflorida2014: LPL start times were delayed FailFish
[2:31:51] hermeneutist: faker's akali was so meh
[2:31:56] NoRulesJG: @thisisdedication how was skt decent in game 3? they got out drafted and didn't play to win early which was their win con
[2:31:58] kuawang: kuro PogChamp
[2:32:06] fkdqjf: skt is clid one man team lol
[2:32:07] la7041831: SKT FANS StoneLightning
[2:32:10] ripnotize: SKT LOST LUL
[2:32:19] Cinamo2: SKT draft back again KKhoma please stick to draft
[2:32:29] StokesAKAShrek: kinda feel like the quinn wasnt the best pick
[2:32:29] scottoflorida2014: SKT fans right now BibleThump
[2:32:34] asheeiii: Lost for HLE? LUL
[2:32:39] hermeneutist: but really, HLE made a great decision to hard push top with first baron
[2:32:42] prick86: yeah, lck is in between games
[2:32:44] YSZN: @No_Rules they provided khan the ability to safely 1v1 renek and if hle didnt coinflip baron skt would have choked them out
[2:32:47] Cinamo2: Also SKT effort was so bad in game 1 I’d think just sub Mata in for the next game
[2:32:50] hermeneutist: that's something you don't see often, esp not in lck
[2:33:01] G58N: SKT T100 EleGiggle
[2:33:14] rogoergooer: ??
[2:33:16] ripnotize: cmonBruh
[2:33:16] chitnyi1993: HLE won dwg skt PogChamp
[2:33:27] ケイザー: use ez ult??
[2:33:32] sqradi: i love watching the "FAKER/SKT HATERS? SoBayed " ppl in the chat get silenced Kreygasm
[2:33:34] hermeneutist: effort's rakan was okay tho
[2:33:38] Cinamo2: SKT draft was so bad u have zero frontline 2 ad carries basically and a 1 and out reksai like how are they gonna teamfight
[2:33:52] NoRulesJG: @thisisdedication Skt had no chance late game and Quinn is a counter matchup to renekton and he did more around the map. Quinn was a terrible pick they had no frontline.
[2:34:14] G58N: @KZyesletsgo imagine giving 2 kills early to Quinn when shes COMPLETELY useless past lanephase even with RFC
[2:34:17] Oburiksss: +770
[2:34:21] StokesAKAShrek: quinn was almost all their dmg tho
[2:34:23] M00191250: Why is it still 0-0?
[2:34:30] eatsleepandrace: Yuuki is so bad
[2:34:32] belacqua_: how is this series so delayed? are they going to switch straight to RNG vs IG?
[2:34:37] YSZN: @No_Rules khan was going to solo get inhib...
[2:34:37] basement111: @chat why is score 0-0
[2:34:44] Cinamo2: At least get the sej or trundle like a reksai???? A reksai who’s job mis game and late game is just trade a kill if u can????
[2:34:48] fnask10: FPX, TES, BLG going to worlds
[2:34:56] needrod: rng vs ig waiting room
[2:35:06] hehexd69691: what the hell when is ig vs rng gonna start
[2:35:11] parra897: wtf about RNG vs IG at 13:00??!!!!
[2:35:18] M00191250: Same question
[2:35:33] basement111: why is score 0-0
[2:35:48] la7041831: HALF HOUR TO IGRNG GAME
[2:35:52] parra897: but they are 0-0 xdd chinease puntuallity onpoint
[2:35:52] Cinamo2: Are they skipping the bo3 for this game?
[2:35:59] crushonmaeve: the most nonfiesta game in lpl history
[2:36:00] Cinamo2: So it’s just a 1 game decision?
[2:36:11] crushonmaeve: boring
[2:36:13] basement111: this match is lck
[2:36:14] kuawang: ADD PogChamp
[2:36:21] Sing3d: typhon killed millions of people so they had to delay the game
[2:36:24] crushonmaeve: yea lck style
[2:36:41] M00191250: Looks like many people came here after SKT vs HLE XD
[2:36:41] sqradi: millions of ppl wtf
[2:36:45] hermeneutist: garvey PogChamp
[2:36:45] lunarwolffff: LUL

[2:36:53] not_for_fun: HAHAHA
[2:36:55] rogoergooer: JG??
[2:36:58] babbols: Trrrrr
[2:37:01] Sing3d: Garveyg
[2:37:03] hermeneutist: why did jg try to 1v1 top laner lmao
[2:37:21] Cinamo2: Because he’s sylas
[2:37:24] ripnotize: NA GANK LUL
[2:37:27] mattaru: HLE clapped SKT so hard FeelsGoodMan
[2:37:41] hermeneutist: actually, 1mil people were displaced
[2:37:46] vismortis: RNG waiting room Kappa
[2:38:00] 魔女王女: now that I think about it I could be watching KT vs jag that's sounds about as entertaining as this....
[2:38:09] goblinguy01: Typical SKT, throws at Baron. Fake baited his team into three bad fights. Yet the rest of the team gets blamed
[2:38:17] 21044275: Mark my words, this year's world finals will be G2 vs Fnatic
[2:38:21] YSZN: The issue with skt in that match is that they dared HLE saying they won't do a 50-50 baron, they will hesitate with engages and HLE proved them wrong, then punished for a pick like quinn where they did an all in on that split push. IG does it too where they disrespect weaker teams
[2:38:23] Cinamo2: Prob more because they’re bottom teams so it’s more interesting
[2:38:34] goblinguy01: Faker lost them the game at 10 minutes with almost dying at Dragon
[2:38:46] xyanade: why do ppl still think fnatic can go to worlds with edg debuff
[2:38:51] YSZN: SKT is still a high chance winning worlds, but they need to work on consistency as with IG
[2:38:53] vismortis: Mark my words, this year's world finals will be TSM vs OG
[2:39:03] goblinguy01: Clid doesn't play like a Chinese jungler anger
[2:39:09] toodlele: @goblibguy01 it was the fact that skt only had 1 tp
[2:39:09] basement111: @thisisdedication lol
[2:39:11] goblinguy01: anymore*
[2:39:21] 21044275: SKT have 0 chance of winning worlds if G2 are in form
[2:39:21] 魔女王女: @xyanade fnatic will go to worlds but expect them to be free for top contenders
[2:39:29] goblinguy01: @toodlele Did you see an ADC? Teddy was afk
[2:39:30] 21044275: G2 has better players than SKT in every position
[2:39:46] 21044275: G2 also has better teamplay and macro than SKT
[2:39:48] Cinamo2: They have Haru as a sub SKT has haru as a sub which is crazy I feel bad he should be a starter for another team
[2:39:53] goblinguy01: 0/1/0 World Class ADC
[2:39:59] Wrath_Of_Zaun: PLS FINISH that matches iG RNG waiting room
[2:40:01] 21044275: Basically G2 is a level or 2 above SKT
[2:40:02] cukcen: PYL LUL
[2:40:07] YSZN: SKT will likely beat every top team in the LCK, ignore the HLE blemish
[2:40:10] kauansccp0: @21044275 xD
[2:40:17] goblinguy01: 2-0 Anyone. We want to see IG vs. RNG
[2:40:21] eatsleepandrace: Wtf
[2:40:26] robnhoney: 0/1/0 olaf might as well be 0/10/0
[2:40:31] arionexus: no other lec team can go to above semi except g2 imo lpl much better overall
[2:40:49] 21044275: @kauansccp0 you think I kid but it's true, G2 is clearly the best team right now, they have 4 players who are top 3 in their position
[2:40:51] goblinguy01: G2 needs to dodge IG, they can make finals
[2:40:52] basement111: theyll switch to rng in 20min probably
[2:40:55] babydeul: @21044275 ok bro
[2:41:01] JAG_Blanc: Stream will be switching to RNG vs IG after this match
[2:41:04] goblinguy01: IG vs G2 is bad news for G2
[2:41:08] JAG_Blanc: dont worry
[2:41:12] 21044275: Caps, Wunder and Mikyx are the best in the world in their position
[2:41:14] Boogielol: wait 20 minutes left for rng vs ig and this game is on 0:0??
[2:41:23] Rudiko: the way to beat g2 is to beat them in the early game, no way they can come back vs world class teams
[2:41:29] 魔女王女: seems rng vs ig will start on time on douyu
[2:41:30] toodlele: delayed due to typphoon
