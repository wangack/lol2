[3:16:12] Boogie1blyat: i got zero hopes for edg now after seeing this
[3:16:18] Boogie1blyat: Kappa
[3:16:25] HystericsCasts: I think one of the best is what he meant
[3:16:35] 21044275: doinb best mid laner? mechanically not even close
[3:16:52] carryme40: scout
[3:16:55] HystericsCasts: I agree, Doinb, Xiaohu, Knight, Scout, Rookie etc
[3:16:56] Quintrophenia: how can IG qualify for worlds, only points?
[3:17:00] Boogie1blyat: well its not all about mechanics no?
[3:17:04] znixon__: 8th
[3:17:08] HystericsCasts: IG have two easy series to finish, they will make it
[3:17:11] Boogie1blyat: SKT Scout PogCHamp
[3:17:13] Boogie1blyat: PogChamp
[3:17:24] 21044275: I know, but mechanical skills are important in high pressure games, and doinb is the living proof
[3:17:31] Norgos21: Mechanically Knight is No1 by far. But Doinb as a roam machine top 1 in my eyes
[3:17:34] HystericsCasts: but IG can make worlds because they have the most points, if they make semis I think they make it alone on points iirc
[3:17:36] sqradi: but u forget IG's debuff against weak teams this split LUL
[3:17:39] Boogie1blyat: hehe
[3:17:39] 21044275: Doinb has always failed in high pressure games, cause he isn't confident in his mechanics
[3:17:53] lordofadditionalpylon: iG spring champ
[3:18:11] 21044275: Rookie won worlds last year cause he played with confidence
[3:18:18] Norgos21: IG FPX RNG
[3:18:18] LmaoLp: @HystericsCasts there's a situation where they don't make it on points if they get 4th place instead of 3rd, but yeah, generally make semis = make worlds on points
[3:18:39] 21044275: Doinb has no confidence in his mechanics, which is why he sucks in Bo5s
[3:18:43] HystericsCasts: Yeah that's true, because JDG will most likely not make playoffs, FPX have a really good chance
[3:18:48] Quintrophenia: I dont think the performance nationally matters in the world championship, everyone adjusts their playstile in worlds always
[3:18:54] HystericsCasts: if FPX make finals im pretty sure they are secure
[3:18:55] LEKO25: Who won Sn vs Fpx?
[3:19:06] HystericsCasts: I have to go through and do scenarios
[3:19:12] LmaoLp: fpx 2-0

[3:20:07] Norgos21: I wish FPX will win this split
[3:20:11] LmaoLp: just keep in mind the boosted points during summer playoffs @HystericsCasts
[3:20:12] MaterialBurst00: which teams look more likely to go to worlds?
[3:20:16] 21044275: If TES loses in finals they go on points
[3:20:27] dmonblu: @Norgos21 No they wont they r super disrespectful team
[3:20:29] HystericsCasts: yeah true
[3:20:30] Norgos21: IG 90%
[3:20:42] dinn9999: 1
[3:20:43] Norgos21: FPX 60%
[3:20:45] dmonblu: RNG will win split no doubts LUL
[3:20:47] mattaru: he'll have to tell his mum he goes to trump university instead of harvard Kappa
[3:20:51] Norgos21: RNG 30%
[3:20:55] 21044275: TES making worlds on points is most likely, and RNG will probably win the split
[3:21:02] 21044275: Which leaves the gauntlet for IG, SN and FPX
[3:21:05] svens_ex_boyfriend: @dmonblu what? No they won’t
[3:21:13] MaterialBurst00: can RNG stop G2s gei style?
[3:21:13] kprs1231: @Norgos21 Privet :) I ty tyt)
[3:21:13] mattaru: why are TES still playing Ben. he's freaking awful
[3:21:29] Norgos21: only FPX can
[3:21:30] aprichan: No edge is gonna win the split

[3:25:09] lordofadditionalpylon: key factor is whether 369 rolled out 3 6 or 9
[3:25:11] krenoime: TL will surprise people
[3:25:18] not_ur_cha: do knight9 have a special keyboard
[3:25:24] not_ur_cha: how does he play

[3:25:27] sqradi: or maybe roll out a 69 Kappa
[3:25:28] not_ur_cha: if his left handed
[3:25:34] mattaru: tl will surprise people by making quarterfinals and losing
[3:25:38] HystericsCasts: 3+6=9 btw
[3:25:48] 21044275: 369's mental is soooo bad, he tilts so easily and have no confidence in high pressure games
[3:25:58] lordofadditionalpylon: 3 = below avg, 6 avg, 9 top tier
[3:26:01] 21044275: TES needs to hire a sports psychologist
[3:26:10] HystericsCasts: Did you know Knight used to play with his arms crossed over each other before realising he could just swap his mouse to the left side.. LUL
[3:26:24] krenoime: wow

[3:47:31] mattaru: ResidentSleeper
[3:47:49] Exter_is_b: according to that logic letting the enemy farm a single minion means its no longer a perfect game
[3:47:50] 21044275: @iLawz we're talking realistic man, it's realistic to not lose platings
[3:47:52] YSZN: @turkusowy_nick I just wonder what the point is behind all of this is, it seems trivial

[4:27:24] carryme40: but dionb is more of ganking bot lane and less i will carry us in teamfight.
[4:27:30] brandoniannn: all of them are individually godlike mids
[4:27:36] carryme40: dionb carry but he do it by ganking bot
[4:27:42] carryme40: and get the adc ahead
[4:27:52] carryme40: it is still good way to win, but not 1v9
[4:28:00] krenoime: caps is also roamer and insane mechanics
[4:28:01] teemo5519: doinb roaming is the best
[4:28:17] brandoniannn: bdd was also very known for his roaming plays
[4:28:26] brandoniannn: when he was stomping with KZ/LZ
[4:28:26] krenoime: caps my favorite midlaner cause he is european
[4:28:32] brandoniannn: champs like taliyah

[4:30:01] brandoniannn: @sounyuumaru tarzan is
[4:30:07] carryme40: @sounyuumaru chovy would be my pick for the best mid laner in the world except he choked twice in playoff. still no lck title despite stacked team....
[4:30:11] brandoniannn: i know still think chovy is disgusting
[4:30:22] brandoniannn: interesting

[4:32:48] brandoniannn: just so inconsistent sometimes
[4:33:05] carryme40: okay, perkz is getting so much credit when his team is stacked, i would like to see him be on a lesser skilled team and carry them 1v9
[4:33:11] brandoniannn: perkz mid>perkz bot
[4:33:20] teemo5519: BO3 yes
[4:33:24] Linko98: perkz yasuo>perkz lucian

[4:33:41] brandoniannn: mikyx actually best player on g2
[4:33:41] carryme40: this is why i don't think cap is the best mid laner in the world, stacked team makes it hard to judge how good he reallly is
[4:33:45] brandoniannn: or wunder imo
[4:33:59] krenoime: mikyx best saport world

[4:34:52] krenoime: i cant wait for worlds
[4:34:59] boostedtoaster42: Knight is overrated :)
[4:35:05] brandoniannn: jankos historically dominant

[4:35:13] brandoniannn: chovy + knight bromance is the best

[4:35:28] teemo5519: @brandoniannn Most of them are good,for me, G2 and FPX are at the top Tier
[4:35:34] brandoniannn: yee
[4:35:46] carryme40: knight is a top three mid laner , but xiaohu and doinb are ahead of him. and their teams have better records this split.
[4:35:56] brandoniannn: depends
[4:35:56] krenoime: @roqtt thats a new pasta
[4:35:59] TaviBleach: @krenoime ig most likely won't even make worlds

[4:37:06] brandoniannn: like they all depend on so many factors
[4:37:12] carryme40: if edg win 2-0, knight is for sure not the best mid laner.
[4:37:15] brandoniannn: hard to pick a single player over the other
