[2:06:45] carryme40: RNG have the best bot lane with the best jungler and mid laner, that team is winning worlds. 100%

[2:16:31] Axiomaya: personally im hard for TEDDY
[2:16:37] MikotoGun: @NarutoEU They weren't a playoff team ofc but I do think they looked a lot better. And Teddy has been looking great on SKT in the latter half of this split, so he could prob at least win a couple games for JAG
[2:16:43] garysocontrary: I just want the more aggressive teams from each region to make worlds, FPX will be sick internationally

[2:26:02] shikarie02: @MikotoGun then he should leave and go home to EU. there is no one outside of Team Liquid and C9 that are surefire bets for Worlds and none of them need new mids. At least with him there, TSM can attract new names. He is literally their brand in League

[2:49:44] carryme40: @Archie4311 i only saw game 1 where his kennen was beating theshy. i stop watched after that.
[2:49:47] achesquared: @carryme40 the only reason RNG won is just iG being dumb like taking 3v5 fights multiple times
[2:50:03] Yolo_pete: @Adaptatab Yea but now they lost 0-2 to DMO LUL
[2:50:04] lunarwolffff: ig should have won vs rng

[2:54:57] achesquared: @kr_worst_region I somehow feel like FPX and TES still won't make it to Worlds
[2:55:03] carryme40: uzi being denied a world title by faker for the fourth times would be cruel and unusual punishment.
[2:55:03] yaaz000: IG owners should got him a new gf LUL
[2:55:20] Archie4311: skt lost to HLE of all teams ...

[3:16:21] sdimi95: @path19833 i think they can but it is too difficult because both the 7-7 teams have to lose for them to get in
[3:17:02] bospho: oh i know imp WOW
[3:17:03] carryme40: JDG need to win this game, and win against RNG (not likely) just to have a chance

[3:18:01] Mete5533: %40 jdg %60 omg i think now
[3:18:10] carryme40: jdg is probably not making playoff because there are not 2 spots left and ig, lng, and we are probably taking those spots.
[3:18:14] Arkn23: wait, wasnt JDG in finals during spring split? What happened to them LUL
[3:18:35] carryme40: they got a lucky draw
[3:18:39] carryme40: in that spring playoff
[3:18:49] kepzzz: LNG will win their last game. no hope for JDG.
[3:18:50] samutries: 20 teams, just wow
[3:18:59] vaction_smurf: Who cares if they're techincally not out, do you think a 5/8 team could do anything at worlds anyways? No, then no point in even hoping
[3:19:08] sdimi95: @Arkn23 they never really were a top team they overperformed and the enemy teams made a lost of mistakes for me. Also zoom was a gof
[3:19:16] Arkn23: oh so luck's ran out. gotcha LUL
[3:19:18] ReWriters: Bad management. The team seems to just give up after RR
[3:19:22] killer21252: jd 1/0 zoe <3 <3
[3:19:38] carryme40: to be precise, IG is probably taking the 7th spot, which means there is really one spot left and WE + LNG is probably taking that spot . sorry jdg fans

[3:21:14] carryme40: honestly WE is facing V5 in their last game and if they win (most likely), JDG Is eliminated regardless of how they do.

[3:21:57] lunarwolffff: they have to win against rng which isnt happening
[3:21:59] carryme40: JDG is not making hte playoff simple because WE will beat V5 and have a better record over JDG.
[3:22:05] jzeeeee123: OMG and playoff in same sentence LUL
[3:22:07] sdimi95: anyone has any view on IG as I didn't watch most of their games this split

[3:23:03] lunarwolffff: @sdimi95 ning become garbage, new jungler is good but somewhat lacks synergy with the rest
[3:23:19] dockantoop: IG coinflips as usual but now they’re not better than everyone in micro so they don’t win the 50/50s anymore
[3:23:26] suspendvictim: @shikarie02 mobile data bro,, still 0-0?
[3:23:29] carryme40: honestly, IG missing the playoff coudl happen, they facing LGD next and ldg is playing so good for some reason.
[3:23:44] carryme40: of course IG then face RW, which is an easy win for IG...
[3:23:48] sdimi95: I saw the IG games against RNG and I think they are still pretty good but they put themselves in a spot that they will have to fight for worlds
[3:23:52] shikarie02: @suspendvictim YES LUL i think it'd be better if you just choose "audio only" instead of wasting data on video at this point
[3:24:00] ZZPulse: IG always 2-1 or 1-2 against every team
[3:24:09] lunarwolffff: @sdimi95 they looked good because ning didn't play
[3:24:21] carryme40: I can see IG losing to LDG, but not against RW and IG only need to win one of those 2 games to make playoff.
[3:24:26] dockantoop: carryme40 says ever IG fan before IG loses to some low tier team LUL
[3:24:34] dockantoop: @carryme40
