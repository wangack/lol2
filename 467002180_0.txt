[0:47:05] falcogrine: LEC is where its at
[0:47:07] DoinkusDown: Cant wait for a NA/EU worlds sweep. :)
[0:47:11] Zhareiva: Did you watch the shitshow that is called lck??? @n1ckst4r02
[0:47:26] YSZN: saying wildcard>na makes you look like a troll, I'm willing to accept wildcards turkey/vietnam > lms though
[0:47:27] sqradi: no i'd scrap RR altogether bc its irrelevant bo1s chosen randomly
[0:47:32] fridaychill: LCK has had worse drafts and can't adatp to how the meta is supposed to be played
[0:47:39] sqradi: even when LPL won the last 2 years i didnt think they were above LCK
[0:47:51] sqradi: until they actually won worlds and sealed the deal
[0:48:04] sqradi: won RR* i mean
[0:48:10] LeonBlackYT: lck is a mess the top teams only win cause they group and contest drakes, the bottom dont even try xd
[0:48:13] yum_nai_: serious mic checks ResidentSleeper
[0:48:14] sqradi: in RR OMEGALUL

[0:48:23] fridaychill: not even the Eu Na one
[0:48:29] fridaychill: I care about regular splits
[0:48:32] sqradi: so when LPL smashed LCK RR in 2017 LPL > LCK?
[0:48:39] sqradi: OMEGALUL
[0:48:41] fridaychill: apparently so
[0:48:54] Zathorius89: LULW
[0:49:05] fridaychill: or it's cheap
[0:49:17] sqradi: bruh its u guys who use it as an excuse
[0:49:19] fridaychill: china to korea isn't too pricey
[0:49:28] sqradi: when LPL won RR "its just 4fun, LCK wasnt trying at all"
[0:49:36] fridaychill: I'm not even from Na LUL
[0:49:41] fridaychill: I'm 100'% european
[0:49:44] sqradi: and now when LCK won suddenly its the most serious tournament to ever exist
[0:50:14] sqradi: whatever helps you sleep at night mate
[0:50:17] LmaoLp: RR was a display in what doing really good prepwork can achieve - LCK committed hard to finally getting a rift rivals win for the first time, whereas while LPL cared about it they didn't care close to as much.
[0:50:28] rearcat: lec lost to vietnam twice lol
[0:50:33] fridaychill: I don't think you're watching the regions closely if you think LCK is better
[0:50:34] sqradi: hey if it helps cure your depression or whatever
[0:50:51] fridaychill: LPL has better talant than LCK
[0:50:54] fridaychill: it's more teams
[0:51:06] YSZN: I feel bad for lms, can't afford imports, if i recall low playerbase and now you have the best players going to lpl
[0:51:06] fridaychill: I couldn't really fit them in
[0:51:12] fridaychill: also the first game was super snore
[0:51:13] markkzgz: 4Head
[0:51:34] cherishbunny: i think that LCK is weaker

[0:51:57] fridaychill: yes
[0:52:06] johnnyrivers: croki LUL

[0:52:21] yum_nai_: skt are on a ridiculous win streak
[0:52:26] LeonBlackYT: faker trash but undefeated 17-1 Kappa
[0:52:32] fridaychill: IG*

[0:55:55] GretSeat: lol g2 isn't winning worlds
[0:55:58] koiyesh: Not good as LCK
[0:55:59] hermeneutist: Starting his journey on SKT, Lee "Scout" Ye-chan had been hailed as the next in line to Faker. Gifted and raring to go, he would wait no longer and headed westward to join EDG back in Summer 2016.

[0:56:50] YSZN: @qNpHardt pro sports have 30 teams or so leagues on average and china has an obscene playerbase it seems outlandish since it's 3x the other leagues, but it makes sense for china
[0:56:55] fridaychill: They were playing better than every player on SKT that day
