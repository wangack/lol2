[0:02:53] Mackenjo: antonioDEADLY
[0:03:44] imDpx: this stream is in english?
[0:03:48] imDpx: thought it was only chinese
[0:04:00] AustinXhensL: nah
[0:04:20] AustinXhensL: theres even a crew that does the official streams off days
[0:04:24] brotakuplays: It's purely in meme language.
[0:04:39] AustinXhensL: that said the backup crew kinda sucks
[0:04:46] brotakuplays: ^
[0:04:49] brotakuplays: They really do, but it's okay.
[0:04:59] imDpx: oh yikes
[0:05:03] AustinXhensL: theyre better than they were last season tho
[0:05:12] goblinguy01: Do these matches mean anything?
[0:05:27] goblinguy01: I doubt Victory5 vs World Elite be will exciting.
[0:05:40] goblinguy01: IG will just run it down, and maybe 2-0 but I assume 2-1 RW.
[0:06:54] kais295_: who is awake
[0:06:57] marchendeath: what this bgm name
[0:07:15] kais295_: who is #1 team?
[0:07:21] AustinXhensL: hmmmm we 2-1, rw 2-1, rng 2-0
[0:07:30] Zucchi98: BabyRage
[0:07:41] goblinguy01: DoinD's team is Numba One Pog
[0:07:45] goblinguy01: Until Semis LUL
[0:08:11] goblinguy01: Poor FPX, I really want them to make worlds before he retires. Same for the rest of the team
[0:08:13] LlamaTiiddies: Why is this on so early?
[0:08:29] YSZN: @lpl are you going to stick with we vs v5 since we still is fighting for playoffs?
[0:08:30] goblinguy01: First match will end in 50 minutes lol
[0:08:34] AustinXhensL: they always start stream 1 hour before opening ceremony starts
[0:08:41] YSZN: playoff implications> big name teams imo
[0:08:56] goblinguy01: LCK has SKT as 4am O_o
[0:09:05] goblinguy01: We all know they can't LCK IG, SB LUL
[0:09:06] LlamaTiiddies: I'm in NA and LPL usually starts around 5am for me. it's only 1am. Much earlier than usual
[0:09:38] AustinXhensL: im also in na and i shouldve went to sleep 3 hours ago
[0:10:09] AustinXhensL: in the trash where it belongs
[0:10:44] jupiter2412: @LlamaTiddies so ur in the east coast btw
[0:11:02] LlamaTiiddies: Yes, I'm in East Coast. I'm in canada LUL
[0:11:07] AustinXhensL: going to opl because better bgm
[0:11:58] 21044275: wtf? leaguepedia says RNG JDG was first game of the day
[0:12:04] 21044275: Fucking liars
[0:12:13] Rixoki: omg
[0:12:17] Rixoki: if ig dont make playoffs
[0:12:21] Rixoki: im gonna be so sad
[0:12:28] goblinguy01: IG will make playoffs
[0:12:32] goblinguy01: SKT might not
[0:12:33] Rixoki: i need v5 and rng to win
[0:12:41] Rixoki: ig can miss playoffs
[0:12:44] 21044275: sorry but why would you be sad?
[0:12:44] Rixoki: if we and jd win
[0:12:48] Rixoki: and ig lose
[0:12:49] 21044275: IG is trash
[0:13:01] 21044275: I hope IG stay away from worlds
[0:13:04] Rixoki: yikes
[0:13:13] Rixoki: iG is trash
[0:13:18] Rixoki: typical twitch chatter
[0:13:21] YSZN: ig is pretty lackluster, i also want them away from worlds this year
[0:13:25] JokerGavin: this freaking chat does not allow chinese???
[0:13:28] lianzongwang: lol
[0:13:31] JokerGavin: any Chinese here
[0:13:40] JokerGavin: shufule
[0:13:48] lol_zx1: shu fu le
[0:13:53] Rixoki: i think fpx, rng for sure
[0:13:59] Rixoki: who do you guys want for 3rd rep
[0:14:06] 21044275: IG's top and jungle ints half their games
[0:14:07] Rixoki: to worlds
[0:14:11] JokerGavin: fpx, rng, ig
[0:14:14] JokerGavin: other teams are jokes
[0:14:14] Rixoki: they got new jungle
[0:14:22] Rixoki: maybe tes?
[0:14:27] JokerGavin: maybe tes is good 2
[0:14:29] 21044275: IG and RNG are both jokes
[0:14:29] Rixoki: rng, fpx, tes
[0:14:30] goblinguy01: IG new's jungler is legit
[0:14:30] lol_zx1: IG's support and jg are meh
[0:14:32] YSZN: jackeylove and rookie are the only reliable players on ig lately
[0:14:32] JokerGavin: yeah, forgot about dat one
[0:14:38] Zarmack: mamacita LUL
[0:14:39] goblinguy01: He is 17 I think, so I think will Int less
[0:14:45] 21044275: LPL is trash this year
[0:14:47] lol_zx1: no team really stands out tbh
[0:14:48] JokerGavin: jackeylove and rookie have been underperforming too
[0:14:49] hopingforablast: RNG IG PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:14:52] lol_zx1: ye agree
[0:15:00] YSZN: BLG came out of nowhere, they aren't flashy but maybe they'd be okay representives
[0:15:01] goblinguy01: TheShy can be TheShit. King Ning is usually King Int LUL
[0:15:20] Rixoki: TheShy stat-wise is still one of the best top laners in LPL
[0:15:22] 21044275: This year I see lpl and I can't name any team that can actually challenge for worlds
[0:15:35] goblinguy01: TheShy could the best next Faker...but he runs it down a lot
[0:15:43] aesf107: TriHard
[0:15:44] Rixoki: @goblibguy01 i agree
[0:15:45] YSZN: FPX has best worlds chance for LPL
[0:15:47] 21044275: Last year I can name both RNG and IG as challenger for worlds, this year I can't name any lpl teams
[0:15:51] goblinguy01: It took Uzi so many years to be the best AD of all tiem. TheShy will learn lol
[0:15:52] Rixoki: theshy has so much potential
[0:15:58] goblinguy01: TheShy reminds of S3/s4 Uzi
[0:16:04] EDG_richardk1568: @goblibguy01 this guy
[0:16:06] goblinguy01: Uzi making hero plays that loses and wins the game
[0:16:10] 21044275: Theshy ints half his games, fuck him
[0:16:16] YSZN: It would be funny if BLG wins worlds
[0:16:17] goblinguy01: @EDG_richardk1568 Pog spreading real facts
[0:16:26] EDG_richardk1568: sup
[0:16:27] 21044275: Look at MSI, Theshy was absolutely terrible
[0:16:38] goblinguy01: TheShy Ints = Your Trynd. TheShy carries = Opponent's Tryn LUL
[0:16:54] goblinguy01: When the TheShy ints, he is the 0/10 Mundo 4Head
[0:16:57] Rixoki: theshy had one bad series against tL and inted one game as neeko when they already secured first seed
[0:16:57] 21044275: Theshy manages to lose lane to Impact lmao
[0:17:00] Rixoki: at msi
[0:17:37] 21044275: Anyways for lpl's sake, the 3 teams at worlds should be FPX, TES and SN
[0:17:39] Rixoki: TheShy is bad compared to 2018
[0:17:43] YSZN: Kuro 2019 Worlds MVP
[0:17:44] Rixoki: but still an elite top laner
[0:18:01] Rixoki: TES and SN over RNG
[0:18:03] Rixoki: ?
[0:18:04] deeYUMYUM: this music
[0:18:13] 21044275: If RNG goes to worlds then Langx will get shit on and they will crash
[0:18:21] freeko: whoa lpl is on early today
[0:18:23] LlamaTiiddies: I think it's funny. Every region has better music than NA.
[0:18:24] goblinguy01: TheShy could lose to Darshan, but crush Zoom/Kiin/Summit Kappa
[0:18:25] 21044275: Langx is one of the worst top in the league
[0:18:31] PykeFirsTHex: 02:17 AM in Brazil, I'm going to sleep, then watch on youtube
[0:18:33] Rixoki: @freeko thre games today
[0:18:37] goblinguy01: TheShy could lose to any top laner, but still carry the game
[0:18:49] freeko: yeah, 3 matches i guess thats a thing
[0:18:51] 21044275: SN has Angel and Maple flex and would do much better than Langx
[0:19:03] LlamaTiiddies: Is IG even in playoffs this year?
[0:19:06] goblinguy01: Imagine if RNG gets more FW players lUL
[0:19:08] freeko: does the first one even matter for either team making playoffs?
[0:19:08] goblinguy01: LUL
[0:19:20] Rixoki: @LlamaTiddies today can decide if they are
[0:19:24] goblinguy01: RNG = Korean Coaches and LMS coaches
[0:19:24] 21044275: WE has to win @freeko
[0:19:25] freeko: they will get worse if they do
[0:19:29] Rixoki: @freeko yes we is contesting a spot
[0:19:39] freeko: they already have Steak and Karsa, RNG does
[0:19:47] LlamaTiiddies: Ah okay. Cool. I don't follow LPL. I'm just here for the games. But, I like IG and RNG.
[0:19:54] 21044275: S7 was RNG's best shot at winning worlds, and they should of won if they beat SKT
[0:19:55] goblinguy01: They have GreenTea, Dandy and Kezman
[0:20:06] freeko: iG i assume is a win and in?
[0:20:15] 승호닥: hey we are win LCK
[0:20:18] Rixoki: YES
[0:20:27] YSZN: BLG has a 6 series winning streak, which is longest in lpl right now and recently 2-0 RNG, 2-1 IG
[0:20:27] freeko: RNG gatekeeps JDG from playoffs?
[0:20:29] EDG_richardk1568: @21044275 man S7 RNG was POG
[0:20:32] Rixoki: jd can even make playoffs theoretically
[0:20:43] LlamaTiiddies: I'm pretty much waiting for LCK to start so I can watch it while I go to sleep.
[0:20:45] YuYuYuna: pepeD
[0:20:47] 21044275: S7 RNG would have crushed Samsung if they made finals
[0:20:52] YSZN: BLG isn't fancy, explosive and superstars but they are a hot team late in this year
[0:20:59] EDG_richardk1568: yo its tru @21044275
[0:21:03] 승호닥: LCK ACE DWG GRF SKT
[0:21:18] Rixoki: BLG Meteor is really good
[0:21:27] Dang3rRuss: @LlamaTiddies same cyrZzz
[0:21:33] 21044275: BLG is basically a 2 man show of Meteor and Jinjiao
[0:21:44] 21044275: BLG has a below average mid laner, below average top and a decent support
[0:21:59] mkgodx: POG
[0:22:01] goblinguy01: Kuro is carried by their 17 year old jungler
[0:22:02] Rixoki: eh I wouldnt call kuro below average
[0:22:09] EDG_richardk1568: Kuro Kreygasm
[0:22:24] LlamaTiiddies: Has anyone in LPL secured Playoffs yet? Or do we find out after today?
[0:22:28] goblinguy01: LPL have the best junglers. They just need to tone it down lol
[0:22:30] Rixoki: yes
[0:22:45] 21044275: lpl have the best junglers and adc
[0:22:52] goblinguy01: LPL have the best mechanical Junglers, Mids, and ADC. They just need to Int less
[0:22:55] mkgodx: this^
[0:22:57] goblinguy01: Starting back from s2
[0:23:00] alfynity: 🇺🇸 THOUSANDS OF CALORIES WE CONSUME ALL DAY 🇺🇸 BAD FIREARM LAWS HERE TO STAY 🇺🇸 FREE HEALTH CARE OCEANS AWAY 🇺🇸 OUR SCREENS ARE ALWAYS GRAY 🇺🇸 YOU GUESSED IT RIGHT 🇺🇸 WE ARE NA 🇺🇸 DONALD TRUMP 🇺🇸
[0:23:03] Rixoki: fpx, tes, blg, rng are all confirmed
[0:23:07] Rixoki: for playoffs
[0:23:13] EDG_richardk1568: yeah isnt top 4 confirmed?
[0:23:16] LlamaTiiddies: I don't know about you guys but Seasons 3 and 4 were the best for League.
[0:23:17] Rixoki: i think edg and sn too
[0:23:26] Rixoki: is top 4 or top 6 confirmed?
[0:23:35] EDG_richardk1568: totally not an EDG fan guys my name doesnt give it away Kappa
[0:23:39] 21044275: who gets 2nd havent been confirmed
[0:23:40] freeko: Suning is confirmed in
[0:23:40] mkgodx: do the 2 top teams have a by?
[0:23:43] freeko: at 8 wins
[0:23:52] freeko: top 4 teams have byes
[0:23:56] 21044275: if RNG lose even 1 game today, TES is confirmed 2nd, if RNG 2-0 today, they are 2nd
[0:24:00] EDG_richardk1568: yep top 4 bye
[0:24:02] freeko: its double stepladder in LPL i believe
[0:24:14] goblinguy01: s4 EDG was the best
[0:24:25] goblinguy01: s4 EDG = S2 World Elite Kappa
[0:24:29] freeko: so 5 plays 8, 7 plays 6, then 3 and 4 play winners of those matches
[0:24:37] 21044275: RNG can only get 2nd place if they 2-0 JDG today
[0:24:43] 21044275: Any other result and they're 3rd
[0:24:43] freeko: then 1 and 2 get byes into semis
[0:24:55] EDG_richardk1568: oh ye 1 and 2 goes straight into semis
[0:25:14] freeko: suning at 8 wins is only confirmed because they have the tiebreakers over any other team that can potentially tie them
[0:25:23] Rixoki: yeah
[0:25:25] Rixoki: top 6 are in
[0:25:37] Miller57: IG WAITING ROOM :)
[0:25:39] YSZN: Ig is still a scary playoff team due to their peaks, but i dont want a team that inconsistent at worlds, I say they beat SNG and lose the series after 3-2
[0:25:42] Rixoki: fpx, tes,rng,blg,sn,edg
[0:25:43] EDG_richardk1568: maple OMEGALUL
[0:26:00] freeko: look at the run JDG had in spring playoffs
[0:26:07] EDG_richardk1568: yo its tru
[0:26:12] Rixoki: imagine if jdg make it in again
[0:26:12] EDG_richardk1568: JDG had a great run in spring
[0:26:22] Rixoki: and caps has another dream
[0:26:29] mkgodx: the reason the best players are also the ones to int is bc of how close they play to the limit, its the case for a lot of lpl junglers
[0:26:32] EDG_richardk1568: caps
[0:26:32] goblinguy01: Angle is so much better then Maple
[0:26:33] freeko: come playoff time, anything can happen
[0:26:34] EDG_richardk1568: man
[0:26:42] goblinguy01: Maple was good until s8 I'd say
[0:26:43] freeko: JDG proved it in spring playoffs
[0:26:49] EDG_richardk1568: its tru
[0:26:54] Rixoki: lpl is the most fun eague
[0:26:57] Rixoki: league*
[0:27:02] Rixoki: to watch
[0:27:06] goblinguy01: I mean many of the best players in history Int and lose their teams game
[0:27:12] freeko: Maple is still good, but he does not have Karsa to make up for his mistakes anymore
[0:27:12] 21044275: The most hilarious scenario would be, RNG wins the split, TES goes to worlds on points and JDG wins the gauntlet
[0:27:27] 21044275: I'd pay good money for that scenario to happen
[0:27:32] goblinguy01: Like Caps, Uzi, Rekkles, DL, Clearlove, Ning, TheShy, Cool, Loveling etc
[0:27:43] mkgodx: jdg has to make worlds
[0:27:49] goblinguy01: Loveling ran it down half their games, but he did his job on OMG LUL
[0:27:58] mkgodx: imp world buff is real
[0:27:59] EDG_richardk1568: ah man OMG
[0:28:18] goblinguy01: Imp is washed up. Change my mind Kappa
[0:28:20] Rixoki: i could actually see rng losing to jd
[0:28:31] EDG_richardk1568: honestly I can too
[0:28:35] goblinguy01: RNG did lose to G2, they could lose to anyone Keepo
[0:28:39] 21044275: as long as JDG starts Morgan they'll crush rng
[0:28:47] 21044275: Morgan >>> Langx
[0:28:48] shigabb: SourPls
[0:28:59] goblinguy01: You mean LoveZZR 4Head
[0:29:03] mkgodx: wait is that the korean morgan?
[0:29:10] EDG_richardk1568: ^
[0:29:12] goblinguy01: LPL using Australian imports
[0:29:24] Limmitd: Never give up
[0:29:31] Limmitd: Popular lyric in the song
[0:29:36] EDG_richardk1568: Royal Never give up
[0:29:52] zindinevarane: sallySip
[0:30:20] freeko: I would really like to see FPX at worlds, but they seem to just roll over in playoffs
[0:30:36] EDG_richardk1568: FPX huh
[0:30:43] 21044275: how does lovezrr communicate with the rest of rng?
[0:30:54] 21044275: hes australian
[0:31:07] goblinguy01: He speaks Mandarin right
[0:31:10] Rixoki: he doesnt know mandarin?
[0:31:10] bushtheteemo: sign language
[0:31:15] goblinguy01: He is Chinese I believe?
[0:31:21] Rixoki: i would assume he can speak mandarin
[0:31:26] EDG_richardk1568: I think he's chinese too
[0:31:40] goblinguy01: Does he speak Mando though
[0:31:45] freeko: if RNG win, are JDG out of gauntlet contention as well?
[0:31:52] goblinguy01: I assume he understands Mandarin like TheShy
[0:32:03] 21044275: hes the same as biofrost
[0:32:03] Rixoki: theshy understands mandarin?
[0:32:03] EDG_richardk1568: yo rookie's mandarin is pog af
[0:32:10] goblinguy01: Yeah
[0:32:11] 21044275: born in china, natualized
[0:32:15] EDG_richardk1568: ye him and both rookie can speak it very well
[0:32:18] EDG_richardk1568: @Rixoki
[0:32:21] Rixoki: last time i saw theshy stream, he barely say a sentence
[0:32:23] goblinguy01: That's how he takes coms from IG
[0:32:36] 21044275: but if you put biofrost in chinese team, hes gonna have trouble communicating
[0:32:36] Rixoki: ok if you say so
[0:32:38] goblinguy01: That's how Scout was for first year, look at him now
[0:32:48] EDG_richardk1568: when they interviewed them at worlds their mandarin was so good
[0:32:51] Rixoki: i guess ill take your word for it, i thought rookie was the translator
[0:32:55] goblinguy01: He does interviews on Mandarin. Same for GimGoon
[0:32:57] Rixoki: for theshy
[0:33:06] EDG_richardk1568: nah nah theshy can speak it
[0:33:11] Rixoki: ok
[0:33:14] Rixoki: fair enough
[0:33:19] goblinguy01: More then hi/bye, where is my food
[0:33:33] EDG_richardk1568: thats all u need to know
[0:34:01] goblinguy01: Scout, Loken, Ben, SOFM went from 0 Mando to good
[0:34:09] goblinguy01: It just takes efforts :P
[0:34:25] Rixoki: i hear mandarin is easy to learn to speak but not as easy to read/write
[0:34:34] EDG_richardk1568: its tru
[0:34:44] goblinguy01: I saw an interview with Clement Chu where he asked him to speak Vietnamese. He was shy xD
[0:34:52] goblinguy01: Same for any Asian language mate.
[0:35:26] goblinguy01: No wonder Asian languages aren't close to each other even if they share an alphabet.
[0:35:34] dannymori: TRIPLE HEADER PogChamp
[0:35:56] freeko: clement came from LMS casting originally didnt he?
[0:35:56] Rixoki: if we and ig win, jd doesnt have a chance right?
[0:36:06] Rixoki: yes
[0:36:09] goblinguy01: Yes. His English is so good
[0:36:20] goblinguy01: Clement's English is better then most Americans I know LUL
[0:36:24] EDG_richardk1568: wait rush is joining CLG as a streamer?
[0:36:26] EDG_richardk1568: lmao
[0:36:40] Rixoki: til the start of next spring split
[0:36:46] Rixoki: he coud sign for a team in the off season
[0:36:50] Rixoki: makes the most sense
[0:36:59] fchm888: sing?
[0:37:00] Rixoki: since most teams are prob not going to look for roster change
[0:37:06] EDG_richardk1568: optic rush Kappa
[0:37:06] goblinguy01: Realistically, if SKT doesn't make worlds. What are Koreans chance to get past Quarters? 25%
[0:37:07] freeko: JDG needs WE and the other 7 win team to both lose
[0:37:21] freeko: GRF will do good
[0:37:21] Rixoki: damwon are best team in korea
[0:37:27] Rixoki: so i would say still pretty high
[0:37:30] goblinguy01: I can't see Griffin, DWG or team 3 do anything
[0:37:31] freeko: I really like the new korean teams tbh
[0:37:39] ws520xzq: rng cool
[0:37:48] goblinguy01: Griffin will lose in quarters. Change my mind Kappa
[0:38:02] Rixoki: rekkles predicted last year that damwon was gonna win worlds this year
[0:38:04] freeko: if its GRF, DWN, and SB that go, I really think korea has the strongest lineup from top to bottom teamwise
[0:38:18] freeko: he might be right tbh
[0:38:24] Rixoki: from his scrims when fnatic were in korea for worlds
[0:38:31] goblinguy01: Doesn't Nuguri run it down 5/10 games?
[0:38:31] Rixoki: he did an interview with travis gafford
[0:38:49] freeko: ah the irrelevant one, travis gafford
[0:38:50] 21044275: G2 will win worlds this year
[0:38:53] freeko: the barnacle of esports
[0:38:58] 21044275: Don't see any teams on G2's level right now
[0:39:05] Rixoki: travis makes good content
[0:39:06] EDG_richardk1568: you know I dont doubt G2 will iwn worlds this year
[0:39:07] goblinguy01: G2 will smash those teams
[0:39:16] EDG_richardk1568: as of right now but the meta could change
[0:39:16] goblinguy01: G2 needs to dodge IG though
[0:39:19] EDG_richardk1568: meta plays a huge ass part
[0:39:23] goblinguy01: The mental block is real
[0:39:33] freeko: he cried about having to pay doublelift 35k for an interview, and im like nope.. screw that
[0:39:39] EDG_richardk1568: if the meta stays the same I think G2 prob wins worlds
[0:39:47] goblinguy01: We all know what happens Rekkles faces Uzi anywhere
[0:39:48] Rixoki: @freeko it was a joke
[0:40:03] freeko: im not laughing
[0:40:08] EDG_richardk1568: ROFL
[0:40:09] Rixoki: @freeko where are you from? do you not understand sarcasm
[0:40:11] goblinguy01: For EU to make it finals, Two things need to happen - IG loses randomly, and Rekkles avoids Uzi
[0:40:23] freeko: im from NA, I know sarcasm
[0:40:29] EDG_richardk1568: LUL
[0:40:35] freeko: but gafford is just garbage either way tbh

[0:41:23] freeko: then good for him, i just wont be watching any of them because i find him to be at most just useless
[0:41:26] Rixoki: yeah some of his interviews are better than others
[0:41:30] Rixoki: thats a lot of people
[0:41:32] goblinguy01: You know who is a good interviewer is? Ashley Kang? She speaks English/Korean and she is w Kiwi Pog
[0:41:45] EDG_richardk1568: honestly its quite funny watching his interviews
[0:41:47] Rixoki: travis has more chemistry
[0:41:50] Rixoki: with western players
[0:42:05] goblinguy01: Players who never win? monkaHmm
[0:42:12] freeko: he is just the village idiot imho
[0:42:14] EDG_richardk1568: yes its useless I agree but its funny
[0:42:25] Rixoki: @goblibguy01 he has good chemistry with g2 players too
[0:42:37] Rixoki: did you see hot line league during rift rivals?
[0:42:37] goblinguy01: I watch LOL for the winners. That's why I'm a Pats, Chicago Bulls and La Lakers fan Kappa

[0:56:43] nnmate: Wow gungungungun
[0:57:24] 21044275: @Rixoki actually the reason I don't like G2 is because they lost to TL, that and they int half their games
[0:57:39] 自由的男孩: @rattybag hi
[0:57:50] freeko: uhh, G2 slaughtered TL in MSI
[0:58:03] 21044275: I mean
[0:58:06] Rixoki: i dont understand why a team losing would make you hate them
[0:58:07] 21044275: IG lol
[0:58:14] Rixoki: i know what you mean
[0:58:24] freeko: i hate FW right now, because they are losing lol
[0:58:30] freeko: but im a FW fan
[0:58:33] 21044275: Cause losing to TL is a new level of embarrassing
[0:58:36] Rixoki: that makes sense
[0:58:38] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: 3 games PogChamp
[0:58:41] trg_scii: BasedGod
[0:58:49] shiny_chocobo: 3 Games whaaaat POGGERS

[0:58:56] Rixoki: TL were the better team on the day
[0:58:59] percidus_: WutFace
[0:59:01] sqradi: losing isnt a problem its HOW they lose
[0:59:02] 21044275: But TL? That alone deserves all the hate
[0:59:10] freeko: I really want them to send Hanabi off to somewhere else so he can stop hard inting their chances at major tournaments away
[0:59:33] sqradi: its clear IG players dont giv a fck and thats frustrating
[0:59:33] shiny_chocobo: CmonRaz
[0:59:36] freeko: he did it at MSI this year, worlds last year, MSI last year, and I doubt I need to go past that
[0:59:43] 21044275: No shame in losing against the best, but there will be a lot of shame for losing to a meme team
[0:59:55] Rixoki: @21044275 you should at least wait to see how TL does at worlds before you call their loss embarassing
[1:00:35] freeko: FW made an absolutely embarassingly bad baron call against iG in groups that threw their worlds #1 seed into the dumpster and allowed TL to take it away
[1:00:41] shiny_chocobo: WE DUN MIN

[1:01:28] Rixoki: @21044275 i wouldnt call tl a meme team
[1:01:33] carryme40: JAG last night went 0-18
[1:01:43] freeko: hanabi hard inted against phong vu in worlds last year causing them to lose that match and instead of forcing a tiebreak with AFS to see who was 1 and 2, they tiebreakered G2 and lost the #2 to them
[1:01:45] Dethrey: hype
[1:01:50] shiny_chocobo: ty mercedez
[1:01:56] 21044275: They have Xmithie as their starting jungler, that alone makes them a meme team
[1:02:10] freeko: G2 should have been out in groups last year, but FW hard inted and let G2 make their run
[1:02:13] Rixoki: ?
[1:02:22] Rixoki: xmithie has made msi finals twice
[1:02:29] Rixoki: prob best jungler in NA

[1:03:01] Rixoki: so you gotta have some na players
[1:03:02] freeko: i disagree wtih that assessment @21044275
[1:03:05] Rixoki: they got the best
[1:03:07] Rixoki: in na
[1:03:07] sqradi: the most hilariously wrong read on the meta ever

[1:03:38] carryme40: IF WE WIN , JDG IS ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFFS
[1:03:38] mrpinkxxxxx: GO IG <3 <3

[1:10:51] 21044275: It's exactly the same as spring, WE looking dogshit beginning of the split then having a surge towards the end and making playoffs
[1:10:54] Rixoki: yes

[2:14:10] Elrena1918: otto BibleThump
[2:14:23] zenlay: i feel bad for condi
[2:14:27] freeko: ah right, math..
[2:14:34] freeko: either way its either 90 or more
[2:14:38] freeko: which is what matters
[2:14:42] Trid201: who won the first game?
[2:14:53] i_like_cups: tsm
[2:14:55] HUN_Rawulf: we won... i mean, this chat :D
[2:14:57] mamatouwu: gosuP1 gosuP2 gosuP3 gosuP4
[2:15:18] P00pF1ng3r: I suppose it is time to say you all matter in chat and I love you all waffleHeart
[2:15:23] freeko: so its a matter of getting 4 teams to at least 90 points and having another one win summer tournament for iG to be out of gauntlet
[2:15:46] carryme40: @freeko yes and that is not math possible
[2:15:54] sqradi: monkaS
[2:15:56] freeko: I think it is
[2:16:04] KestrelGirl: nl
[2:16:07] KestrelGirl: oops
[2:16:14] carryme40: you can't have 4 teams with 90 points or more and another team win the split
[2:16:23] KestrelGirl: no chat spam FeelsGoodMan
[2:16:27] HUN_Rawulf: YUUMI - GAREN lane banned.... dwightyCry
[2:16:37] carryme40: especially since jdg has 70 points and they are going to be eliminated
[2:16:47] KestrelGirl: conversations FeelsGoodMan
[2:17:07] freeko: JDG not making playoffs is what i think guarantees iG a gauntlet spot
[2:17:15] carryme40: yup
[2:17:28] freeko: I can get 3 teams over iG , but one of them wins the #2 seed on points
[2:17:31] h011ywood: is that top yasuo
[2:17:31] carryme40: YASOU POG
[2:17:32] sqradi: yasuo OTP
[2:17:44] YSZN: this is enemy team yasuo
[2:17:47] carryme40: YASUO IN V5 FINAL GAME>
[2:17:55] Rhinne: YASUO POG
[2:17:59] 21044275: there is actually a scenario where IG don't make gauntlet, though it's pretty unlikely
[2:18:00] freeko: v5 picked blue?
[2:18:12] freeko: i dont see how it is possible
[2:18:15] HUN_Rawulf: Azir - Corki... ZzZzZzZzZ
[2:18:18] carryme40: no we don't
[2:18:28] carryme40: WE need to win and eliminate jdg
[2:18:35] 21044275: If TES gets 3rd, FPX gets 4th, RNG gets 2nd and BLG wins split, IG won't make gauntley
[2:18:36] freeko: because one of the teams that gets ahead of iG has to win the worlds #2 seed on points
[2:18:59] ZABATE17X: Yasuo lol
[2:19:00] HUN_Rawulf: Royal Never Get It ;)
[2:19:07] freeko: yes they will @21044275 because RNG or TOP win second seed on points
[2:19:13] jzeeeee123: IG wants FPX to win summer
[2:19:16] 21044275: BLG wins split = auto worlds, RNG 2nd = 100 points auto worlds
[2:19:41] freeko: correct, that leaves TOP, FPX and IG in gauntlet
[2:19:44] 21044275: FPX 4th = 90 points gauntlet, TES 3rd = 100 points gauntlet, JDG 5th = 90 points gauntlet
[2:19:47] 21044275: IG misses gauntlet
[2:19:48] Dethrey: LPL Yas, the sink or swim strat i see, hmm
[2:19:55] 17412042: FPX IG TES for worlds BlessRNG
[2:20:00] freeko: JDG is out of playoffs
[2:20:04] freeko: they cant get more points
[2:20:10] carryme40: rng need to win the split or get third place or better to make the gauntlet spot
[2:20:23] scorchdelta62: @21044275 Amm#9is
[2:20:44] YSZN: I have v5 winning this, we likely winning the series
[2:21:01] carryme40: @21044275 JDG is eliminated from playoff when WE wint his game, they only ahve 70 points
[2:21:01] Rhinne: W I N D Y Pog
[2:21:03] sqradi: @jyzxr do u see my DM??
[2:21:12] freeko: if WE win this match, JDG is eliminated
[2:21:19] carryme40: IG is guaranteed a gauntlet spot the second WE win this game
[2:21:35] freeko: as is any opportunity for JDG to pass iG for the final gauntlet spot
[2:21:50] CASTrini: HYPERS GO WE
[2:21:58] carryme40: now, IG can still miss the playoff though, if they lose and lng win tomorrow
[2:22:03] freeko: JDG is likely eliminated from gauntlet as well, but its possible for 70 points to be 5th
[2:22:11] zenlay: points :P
[2:22:15] zenlay: WutFace
[2:22:18] carryme40: possible, but not likely
[2:22:22] freeko: even if iG miss playoffs, they are guaranteed a spot in the gauntlet

[2:22:41] CASTrini: TTours
[2:22:42] 21044275: All I want is for IG to miss worlds, don't care who else goes
[2:22:46] ZABATE17X: V5 is out either way right?
[2:22:48] carryme40: rng need to win this split or get 3rd place or better
[2:22:50] CASTrini: W E
[2:22:52] 21044275: I'd give anything for IG to miss worlds
[2:22:56] dwy5: SwiftRage
[2:22:58] oeke2: IG > G2
[2:22:58] freeko: v5 was eliminated weeks ago
[2:23:02] carryme40: IG gauranteed a gauntlet spot dont mean they will win it...
[2:23:07] freeko: they are 5-9
[2:23:08] kuawang: LUL
[2:23:14] zindinevarane: LUL
[2:23:18] carryme40: i dont see IG beating TOP or FPX in a bo5.

[2:23:34] zenlay: worlds*
[2:23:41] edsp_provolone: Who’s first in points?
[2:23:50] freeko: iG with 90
[2:23:55] zenlay: fpc
[2:23:56] freeko: they won spring
[2:24:04] zenlay: fpx and ig
[2:24:14] edsp_provolone: Thanks boys
[2:24:16] sqradi: OMEGALUL
[2:24:17] ktkmsama: ?
[2:24:37] Meghz: says he used f
[2:24:43] freeko: FPX is on 90 points in theory because they are guaranteed no worse than 40 points for 4th place, but they can get more or auto qualify by winning the split
[2:24:52] 21044275: summer points are worth more, so currently FPX is 1st in points
[2:24:52] oeke2: ¿
[2:24:58] rudeoff: he did flash just not in place like it seemed
[2:25:08] freeko: yes summer points are the tiebreaker
[2:25:18] YSZN: fpx please get second and make IG own their trip to worlds if they go, id rather see RNG or BLG win summer playoffs
[2:25:24] YSZN: earn*
[2:25:25] freeko: but FPX could end on 50 points and auto qualify if they win the split
[2:25:47] edsp_provolone: Damn v5 aggressive
[2:25:56] sqradi: is NINT playing today
[2:26:06] goblinguy01: Mystic OMEGALUL

[2:26:12] 金珉周: TP??
[2:26:12] 귀요미할배: ??
[2:26:13] freeko: so FPX being first in points is not entirely true, because they did not yet finish 4th
[2:26:15] razlol: common visual bug on flash. He flashed forward not in place
[2:26:16] YSZN: @edsp_provolone careers on the line still with starting spots and new teams yano
[2:26:35] Meghz: xayah right? @Razleplasm
[2:26:38] freeko: however they are guaranteed to finish ahead of iG no matter what
[2:26:57] CurrerBell7: why 6 teams today?
[2:27:16] razlol: yea xayah
[2:27:24] Meghz: thanks
[2:27:35] Meghz: also is the speactate bugging or my internet
[2:27:42] Meghz: oh he just said it nvm
[2:27:52] freeko: which means, iG cannot be the #2 seed worlds team as whoever wins split and gets second are guaranteed to be ahead of iG if they miss playoffs

[6:09:52] carryme40: u know what i think? they should have xiaohu go top lane,
[6:09:54] hermeneutist: i don't think RNG abuses their toplaners tho

[6:10:02] baejoohyun26: @Boogielol what happens if tes beat fpx tomorrow
[6:10:04] hermeneutist: just kinda neglect
[6:10:05] carryme40: xiaohu went top lane before, and it looked great.
[6:10:17] sqradi: ppl are like "langx isnt bad he just doesnt get resources"
[6:10:21] turkusowy_nick: @hermeneutist its uzi fans abusing letme, he retired because of it
[6:10:22] carryme40: just put xiaohu in top laner
[6:10:23] baejoohyun26: @Boogielol both 13-2
[6:10:29] sqradi: but he makes so much mechanical errors that has nothing to do with resources
[6:10:34] carryme40: just put xiaohu in top lane.
[6:10:44] hermeneutist: oh fan abuse, then yea very similar to TSM lul
[6:10:50] Boogielol: @baejoohyun26 ye but idk how the rules are.. but i guess that they have to play a tiebreaker and the winner will be first
[6:10:56] sqradi: also karsa tried to gank top but langx keeps ulting too early or do some dumb sht that makes the lane ungankable LUL
[6:10:57] hermeneutist: except TSM has no functioning adc
[6:10:58] carryme40: he already playing jayce, rumble, and neeko. put xiaohu in the top lane.
[6:11:10] turkusowy_nick: @hermeneutist he was the best top this team could imagine because carry top with uzi doesnt wori
[6:11:14] uncleewang: cuz both Zztai and xiaohu could go mid & top
