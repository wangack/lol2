[0:48:45] goblinguy01: @macacoalbino6669 It's the last week, and they need to add more games to finish off season before worlds? I assume
[0:48:49] ShesGotMeat: croki
[0:48:57] goblinguy01: LPL has 700 teams, they had to crunch 3 series eventually
[0:49:22] leticiafcv: @goblibguy01 yeah, probably that
[0:49:23] KungPaoPi: oh wtf maple played top this series
[0:49:29] HubaTheTuba: croki lol
[0:50:16] goblinguy01: @macacoalbino6669 LPL has so many teams, this was bound to happen once we reached playoffs lol
[0:50:38] demiurggermanec247: A question for LEC watchers: if G2-XL game was 10/10 festa, how much fiesta rate is usual for G2?
[0:51:08] goblinguy01: G2 plays IG style but better imo
[0:51:16] goblinguy01: Most of their games are fiestas until they want to end Kappa
[0:51:19] DrMenem90: I'd say 6/7
[0:51:28] goblinguy01: 5-7, sometimes 8 if they troll
[0:51:29] Camsanity: @demiurggermanec247 g2 been trollin lately so
[0:51:34] hollandyyyy: naisi
[0:51:44] goblinguy01: G2 can play legit macro when they need to
[0:52:14] DrMenem90: Also, I think IG has a higher ceiling in their performance on how to play the style. But tbf,I feel like G2 has higher lows.
[0:52:16] leticiafcv: Yeah... Did IG classified already? @goblibguy01
[0:52:18] demiurggermanec247: But do they? I started to turn LPL off lately and go to LCK because I don't want to watch fiesta
[0:52:24] IAmStaka: Raz cast or riot
[0:52:31] IAmStaka: Get it? Riot Get it?
[0:52:37] demiurggermanec247: And so if G2 do fiesta I am not eager to watch them
[0:52:39] IAmStaka: BibleThump
[0:52:41] Rhinne: tes vs f[x {pg
[0:52:41] goblinguy01: @macacoalbino6669 IG/G2 play very close, but IG Ints in more games. LPL has more competition :P
[0:52:45] Rhinne: tes vs fpx Pog
[0:52:51] azurewhale_: How does Kr look this year?
[0:53:05] goblinguy01: G2 runs it down against worse teams, and still wins. EU has no competition
[0:53:22] takeset7: lpl chat Pog
[0:53:25] DrMenem90: Korea was really up in the air until last week, I think it really depends on which teams they end up sending to worlds.
[0:53:31] J2easoN: HeyGuys
[0:53:35] Rhinne: lck is looking shaky again feelsbadman
[0:53:36] IAmStaka: GRIFFIN POG
[0:53:46] goblinguy01: I assume Griffin makes worlds
[0:53:53] leticiafcv: @goblibguy01 Ikr, but do you know if they have classified?
[0:53:57] goblinguy01: SKT still might miss world if GenG memes on them in playoffs
[0:54:07] elbuenAdrenaline: Twitch Primegoblibguy01: G2 runs it down against worse teams, and still wins. EU has no competition
[0:54:07] takeset7: if Griffin wins 1 game today against Hanwha Life, they go to worlds
[0:54:19] goblinguy01: @macacoalbino6669 No. I can't answer that mate
[0:54:29] carryme40: griffin going to win more than 1 game against hle...
[0:54:31] goblinguy01: Griffin will Int so badly against good LPL teams :P
[0:54:33] C4M_it: SKT lock playoff m8 @goblibguy01 they need only 3rd/4th for take worldspot

[0:54:52] DrMenem90: SKT gets worlds winning their wildcard playoff match.
[0:54:55] takeset7: yes if they get 1 match win they go to worlds
[0:55:02] goblinguy01: SKT better make it. SKT has a 0% win rate in Gauntlet though
[0:55:14] machaking: 1
[0:55:21] J2easoN: skt at worlds OMEGALUL
[0:55:21] DrMenem90: Even if they don't they might still make it, either through points or gauntlet.

[0:55:34] embracesadnesss: OP AD
[0:55:39] demiurggermanec247: If GRF go 1-2 and DWG go 2-0, they play tiebreak. DWG wins, SKT win in playoffs over GRF, DWG wins season, DWG 1st SKT 2nd
[0:55:39] goblinguy01: SKT 0% win rate in gauntlet
[0:55:48] TrajanTC: skt is likely to auto qualify tbh
[0:55:50] goblinguy01: Look up every gauntlet match they had since s4
[0:56:12] goblinguy01: How do you get meme'd on Najin White Shield and GenG lol
[0:56:20] C4M_it: mmm i look it.. 2 world champ and 1 final at world and 2 msi
[0:56:22] DrMenem90: They've had 4 new members since last gauntlet.

[3:24:44] ESTEpo: VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[3:25:26] h011ywood: yoink
[3:25:53] ssigismund: lgd has a win condition though - vlad ...
[3:26:22] h011ywood: vg has many win conditions
[3:26:40] ssigismund: the problem is vg is notoriously bad at closing
[3:26:50] ssigismund: so vlad condition is real
[3:27:09] crosserat: vlad condition is totally useless when behind
[3:27:13] r0mulera: @ssigismund haha
[3:27:17] kek_ray: Just stall the game to 40min and win
[3:27:18] crosserat: lets not even mention the mordekaisen
[3:27:27] h011ywood: 7-0
[3:27:38] r0mulera: gold opinion LUL
[3:27:39] crosserat: game is over in 10-15 minutes prolly
[3:27:42] Faralay: Is that Sylas skin only allowed in LPL or do westeners just not use it?
[3:27:59] potatozrgud: Sylas has a skin?
[3:28:04] ssigismund: yes that is why I am saying vlad is the only win condition. it would not be true for any other team but bottom
[3:28:07] whaleOwO: visual bug ??
[3:28:10] ssigismund: I don't see another

[3:29:47] ssf_reliewz: @ssigismund LUL
[3:29:57] kayonas: game is definitely over..
[3:30:34] ssigismund: @Faralay i am not sayin vlad would be a good win condition but this is the region where the team that throws the LEAST in end game wins in 2019
[3:30:43] ssigismund: like lucian trying to split with no vision
[3:30:54] Kosicarl1: well... the vg have lvl advantage, that means more than simply kills or gold lead. And LGD are practically playing in 4, because the xin is so much behind and his late is horrible
[3:30:54] Rhinne: yuumi OMEGALUL

[3:33:37] 我的美心裡有蛇: ???
[3:33:38] kek_ray: They finna win
[3:34:15] ssigismund: xin and rek are equally trash. zoe is only good wehen ahead and sylas has which ult to steal?
[3:34:23] 21044275: Sometimes league's champion diversity makes me sad
[3:34:32] ssigismund: i think late game both comps are equal with ez poke being better than lucian zone conrol
[3:34:35] 21044275: Dota's international has 110/117 heroes picked so far
[3:34:46] ssigismund: but i hope it doesnt get that far
[3:34:47] 21044275: lol will never see that kind of diversity
[3:34:59] kek_ray: Steal Morde ult LUL
[3:35:05] ssigismund: @21044275 this means nobody knows champ very well tbh
[3:35:12] tank5869: PogChamp
[3:35:15] ssigismund: I was joking. there are literally no ults to steal
[3:35:28] Kosicarl1: the fact that makes me sad much more is that only about 20% of champions are considerable on the pro level
[3:35:42] ssigismund: i would love even more consistent league champ pool. like imagine faker practicing zed for 5 years
[3:36:12] kepzzz: guys i have a question
[3:36:18] P00pF1ng3r: This season has seemed better about champ diversity imo
[3:36:19] bun_rieu_cua: monskaS

[3:37:09] ltrlplel: LUL
[3:37:10] ssigismund: ya but socce ris the same for decades. and people still watch
[3:37:14] Faralay: This is probably the best season ever in terms of hero diversity, I'd definitely say closer to 50%
[3:37:20] kek_ray: TOO AHEAD
[3:37:22] P00pF1ng3r: Ofc I say that during a game most the champs were spammed most games a year ago
[3:37:23] 我的美心裡有蛇: This Xin is really
[3:37:24] huyly397: :p :p :p :p
[3:37:27] Faralay: Not the 90+% that DotA has but

[3:37:43] kek_ray: kramer can’t carry this
[3:38:06] 21044275: though dota has clear op champs, this year it's elder titan, mirana, etc
[3:38:17] ssigismund: phew
[3:38:21] Kosicarl1: well that means 200$, it was an honor to watch this ;)

[4:06:48] scottoflorida2014: Maple? Now im thinking about maple-flavored bacon
[4:06:49] 21044275: If they place 6th, then they have to beat IG and RNG after that, but if they place 8th then they play EDG then BLG if they win
[4:07:00] 21044275: EDG and BLG are much easier opponents than IG and RNG

[4:08:08] JAG_Blanc: Is IG in same bracket as RNG?
[4:08:12] chico0530: If SN win, they will face IG
[4:08:14] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @21044275 SO SN MIGHT THROW THIS ONE?

[4:53:11] Sing3d: @21044275 why
[4:53:18] sqradi: SN OMEGALUL
[4:53:21] 21044275: too many shit teams
[4:53:38] 21044275: if they have 10 teams and do double round robin, they play more skilled teams more often
[4:53:52] chico0530: hhhh
[4:53:54] Sing3d: NA has 10 teams and most of them are mediocre at best
[4:54:02] lanceryo: maple come to retire
[4:54:07] 21044275: but LPL's top 10 teams are all pretty good
[4:54:13] EsportsTj: @21044275 the year is 2031, the LPL has 21,044,275 teams
[4:54:14] chico0530: lpl need money
[4:54:51] Sing3d: Regions like NA would greatly benefit with more international events, but hey Riot doesnt want to make more of these
[4:54:54] sqradi: so many teams dilutes the talent pool
[4:55:00] 21044275: you honestly think VG, OMG and LGD deserves to be in lpl?
[4:55:01] tianxia430: 2020 more teams
[4:55:12] chico0530: what about TES vs FPX
[4:55:14] Sing3d: low tier teams don't even have the chance to play against other regions
[4:55:16] chico0530: ?
[4:55:25] sqradi: there are some actual good players in the garbage team which is whats so sad
[4:56:08] 21044275: remove, vg, omg, lgd, v5 at the very least
[4:56:12] 21044275: and lpl will be much better

[4:58:07] chico0530: Lpl uses the seat system, you can join it if you pay
[4:58:13] YSZN: gamesmanship is unsavory but happens in every sport and you often can only speculate
[4:58:22] carryme40: WE depend on this AND SUNING IS SANDBAGGING
[4:58:31] Sing3d: @Nibiria KonCha
[4:58:33] YSZN: I hate sandbagging, but i won't act like i wouldn't do it
[5:00:12] YSZN: it turns out LPL playoff teams are scary when you get deep
[5:00:54] 21044275: honestly right now I don't care what team goes to worlds as long as IG don't make it
[5:01:07] 21044275: But it will be hard as they have 90 points
[5:01:44] sqradi: doesnt jdg still have a chance at making worlds
[5:01:49] sqradi: because they have gauntlet?
[5:01:50] SkepticID: suning should be sandbagging duh, why would you want to play against playoffs ig lmfao

[5:03:02] carryme40: WE depend on this series and suning is losing on purpose to avoid IG. this is against the rules of competition!!
[5:03:04] SkepticID: i thought lpl is only adding 2 teams next year?
[5:03:17] carryme40: MORE TEAMS?
[5:03:23] carryme40: but there is still only 3 worlds spots
[5:03:25] carryme40: that is just unfair
[5:03:26] SkepticID: @carryme40 dont act like you wouldnt do it if you were suning lmfao
[5:03:28] sqradi: even if they are that is 2 teams too many
[5:03:28] ethoscorp: @carryme40 honestly maybe SN is just bad
[5:03:40] carryme40: now rng has to compete against 19 other teams for 1 out of 3 world spots?
[5:03:43] carryme40: HOW IS THAT FAIR
[5:03:46] SkepticID: 2 teams into lpl i mean
[5:03:47] 21044275: if lpl adds any more teams then they're gonna be a massive joke
[5:03:50] Benchung: where is plex
[5:04:02] 21044275: I'll stop watching lpl if they add more teams next year
[5:04:06] SkepticID: its gonna be 20 teams in 2021
[5:04:15] carryme40: it is already bs that rng has to compete against 15 teams for 1 out of 3 world spots
[5:04:17] 21044275: unfathomable that they already have this many shit teams but dare to add more
[5:04:19] carryme40: this is unfair
[5:04:21] sqradi: same
[5:04:36] SkepticID: welcome to china lmfao
[5:04:41] Sing3d: Jebaited
[5:04:48] carryme40: THEY have to increase the world spots for LPL
[5:04:49] sqradi: why do we have to sit through 20 garbage games to watch actual good games btween top teams
[5:04:51] carryme40: to match the number of teams
[5:04:52] sqradi: fcking ridiculous
[5:04:55] fungusboo: WAAAAAAAW B8TED JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJ
[5:05:02] Sing3d: @21044275 League is all about money nowadays
[5:05:11] chico0530: however， The strong team is just a few
[5:05:13] carryme40: if you are going to increase the number of teams, they have to increase the number of world spots
[5:05:33] wilcon2: @carryme40 that makes no fucxking sense, then every region could just increase their number of teams to get more spots
[5:06:04] carryme40: lck , lec, na, 3 spots for 10 teams. LPL 3 spots for 15 teams
[5:06:13] wilcon2: so what?
[5:06:13] carryme40: tell me who think that is fair
[5:06:13] chico0530: SN :O :O :O :O
[5:06:25] SkepticID: 3 out of 16 LPL teams will go to worlds but 3 otu of 7 LMS teams will go to worlds LOOOOOOL
[5:06:26] wilcon2: are you actually this mentally handicapped
[5:06:29] Sing3d: @carryme40 they're giving more seeds to Vietnam instead Kappa
[5:06:36] sqradi: tencent needs to stop with their money hungry greed
[5:06:51] IfNotaWalrus: can lng make playoffs?
[5:06:53] sqradi: they will kill lpl and this game
[5:06:57] carryme40: it is unfair for RNG, IG to have to compete against more teams for 1 out of 3 spots compare to na/lec/lck
[5:07:06] nibbz1441: will LNG make play off after this"?
[5:07:16] kylldeth: STEAK KappaRoss
[5:07:23] chico0530: LNG 2:0
[5:07:39] YSZN: sng's face kinda look like a team that could be sandbagging
[5:07:47] chico0530: Then they can
[5:07:56] wilcon2: they should get more spots in LPL but not because they have more teams but because they're the best region, your arguement makes no fucking sense
[5:08:13] Sing3d: As I said previously, League is all about money, its not a competitive game, they just want their game to stay relevant/people to be more engaged with the game (aka spend more money), so they give regons where the game is popular more spots, even if those teams don't have a chance to win.
[5:08:23] YSZN: yasuo??? please no
[5:08:33] YSZN: whew
