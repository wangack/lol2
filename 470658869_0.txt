[4:47:37] vic830710: @jayson_tatum23 if griffin wins summer or skt makes final later then skt goes to worlds, it's like about 2/3. even if all these fail, there is 1 more Bo5 in gauntlet for skt. it's about 80% overall for them( assuming 50-50 for all remaining Bo5s)
[4:47:40] carryme40: EDG can beat blg. i say 50/50 in that series

[4:49:17] REMmu211: cuz it was china production

[4:49:25] pablomr_01: has edg won 3-1?
[4:49:29] a11one_: @sounyuumaru Score played poorly. To say KT wasn‚Äôt good is peak arm chair analysis
[4:49:30] carryme40: the final? that means they beating fpx too?
[4:49:42] si5terfi5ter: it's like they fucked with the tint and didn't know what the settings actually do
[4:49:42] decco41: they think BLG is stronger than FPX OpieOP
[4:49:44] Demkkai: Edg 3-1 sn
