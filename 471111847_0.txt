[2:08:23] carryme40: @PatMaweeny baolan wanted to leave but IG gave in and paid the man. they can't get rid of him now. he has a contract.
[2:08:35] YSZN: why give asura his kaisa again tho, confused
[2:08:38] NoSopaForYou: ning was probably tilted from last game lol
[2:08:38] leticiafcv: @mnsapobvfdiu are you serious? LUL

[2:09:15] 21044275: @sopasopa when he can't eat ally champs
[2:09:18] rafapo12: @thisisdedication they probably rather give the kaisa than meta picks for other lane I guess
[2:09:22] ZZPulse: botlane is not the problem

[2:09:35] leticiafcv: PLEASE, TELL ME THIS IS THESHY'S SYLAS Kreygasm
[2:09:37] carryme40: @PatMaweeny duke is the most expendable member, but he is the most decorated top laner of all time. so they have to play him once in a while
[2:09:38] StarSashimi: ning inted game 1
[2:09:43] fridaychill: Varus Tahm is the strongest 2v2 champs you can have

[2:10:19] PatMaweeny: @carryme40 yeah well baolan wanted to do that after msi in the split they cant just find a new support that fast. They would have had to wait till offseason
[2:10:20] victorious14: why is iG doing so bad this season? is it because of MSI or because their previous coach left to go to dwg?
[2:10:27] J2easoN: ig will snowball this game and make it 1.1
