[0:34:47] Sov25: @TgAmagedon IG is 100% in gauntlets. The best case scenario is for TOP and FPX to go finals and take the first two seeds so IG can be the final boss in the gauntlet.
[0:34:48] Yolo_pete: Who do you think will win chat?

[0:36:24] Sov25: @TgAmagedon Nope can depend. If RNG is 2nd they have more points than IG.
[0:36:31] HystericsCasts: BLG Kreygasm
[0:36:44] JAG_Blanc: IG wont go to worlds
[0:36:54] TgAmagedon: yes thats also a possibility
[0:36:56] sdiwlicofon: how i can watch lpl with chinese casters ?
[0:36:56] HystericsCasts: if RNG comes 2nd they will auto qualify
[0:37:10] Sov25: @TgAmagedon RNG 2nd would give them 100 points. TOP 3rd would give them 100 points. IG has 90 points total.
[0:37:14] goblinguy01: Pretty much good for IG either way
[0:37:19] goblinguy01: RNG/Top/FPX all want to win
[0:37:20] JAG_Blanc: IG cannot go as second seed
[0:37:26] alonsomafioso: If FPX & Tes go to finals, JDG is in regionals
[0:37:27] JAG_Blanc: only third seed
[0:37:31] goblinguy01: IG will be "underdogs" again
[0:37:35] HystericsCasts: IG cannot correct
[0:37:53] sdiwlicofon: how i can watch lpl with chinese casters ?
[0:37:57] JAG_Blanc: its likely they will lose in the gauntlet to better teams
[0:37:59] goblinguy01: IG should be locked into Gauntlet if Top/RNG perform accordingly
[0:38:00] HystericsCasts: go to douyu
[0:38:01] TgAmagedon: @HystericsCasts not if fpx finishes 3rd
[0:38:04] Yolo_pete: 90points is not enough for 2nd?
[0:38:11] HystericsCasts: true
[0:38:21] HystericsCasts: I still need to make a foldy sheet
[0:38:32] Sov25: @JAG_Blanc Best case scenario is to have the TSM situation, be the final boss in gauntlet and hope you can band aid your problems to win 1 BO5
[0:38:32] Yolo_pete: Bring in Foldius
[0:38:44] goblinguy01: 90pts is good enough for Gauntlet right?
[0:38:46] goblinguy01: Even 3rd
[0:39:02] JAG_Blanc: @Sov25 yup thats right

[5:39:41] genkipanky: @d44kt they drafted for uzi, in a solo lane meta. Do u even unds the game?
[5:39:52] dakt4r: @genkipanky my point was to say that faker is not even top 5 mid now probably, although I consider him the best in history
[5:39:53] varo59: @OpieOP_DansGame_OpieOP yes, against tier 2 teams OMEGALUL

[5:40:43] genkipanky: @d44kt based on 2018, he wasnt even near top 20? He didnt have a team around him. But in 2019 i would put faker in top 3.
[5:40:43] Novagif: but they choked last time
[5:40:45] springjakey: @sanyockv FPX best
[5:40:45] sanyockv: THANKS
[5:40:51] vismortis: wait Faker chocking and playing karma? Is someone watching VODs from 2 years ago?
[5:40:56] ÁßãÈ†Ü: go back your island

[5:42:14] Sasonara: @vismortis Nah man he gets Solokilled in 2/3 of his games and falls down 60cs. That's usually not what good players do 4Head
[5:42:14] dakt4r: @genkipanky not chovy, people rate him quite highly
[5:42:17] Hayzt: UMA JAN BETTER BOTLANER THAN UZI :)
[5:42:17] Hotchocolate191: Rogue > TSM means that it's confirmed that rogue si best
[5:42:25] genkipanky: @Hayzt make no mistake, uzi carries when people give him resources. Even DL and Rekkles knows it.. But now is not the adc meta LUL
[5:42:34] Novagif: ShowMaker, Doinb, Faker, Knight, Chovy, Caps
[5:42:35] Hayzt: uma jan will play mages bruiser at worlds and stomp all botlane :)
