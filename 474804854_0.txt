[2:16:35] carryme40: FAKER? HE PLAY IN A LEAGUE WITH NOOB MIDS. LCK IS A JOKE
[2:16:37] ErminioOttone: @carryme40 knight9 is better imo
[2:16:50] adroit5927: xiaohu is coinflip, he can be quite good but not elite, maybe his peak is similar to a jensen on carries
[2:17:02] 1kenn1: Xiaohu got destroyed by Caps
[2:17:02] xannygo: Faker = KR Caps
[2:17:06] 1kenn1: hes not top 3

[2:26:54] kinghanamaru: BADD LUL

[2:27:01] 1kenn1: my dade of the year award nominees for 2019 is Khan, Doinb and Rookie
[2:27:10] Benchung: BADD LUL
[2:27:12] Sing3d: 🤡 Clap
[2:27:13] ZZPulse: @carryme40 if FPX lose , does it mean RNG need to get 3rd seed?
[2:27:27] sqradi: rookie hasnt been relevant in 2019 enough to win dade
[2:27:38] xannygo: @adroit5927 Or if SKT swapped their players with JAG, they could win worlds
[2:27:41] MistuuhPaper: replace Doinb with the whole team of JAG
[2:27:46] MistuuhPaper: LULW
[2:27:58] 1kenn1: no one expected anything from JAG
[2:28:00] WildRafa: FPX countered by wards lol
[2:28:00] kinghanamaru: 3rd seed IG SeemsGood
[2:28:07] dakt4r: JAG > G2 btw
[2:28:10] xinhaochan: GP SwiftRage
[2:28:17] xannygo: @MistuuhPaper So you're saying Doinb is worth 5 players? Pog
[2:28:18] Benchung: ????
[2:28:20] samgreig98: ADD More farm?
[2:28:23] Benchung: open mid
[2:28:24] adroit5927: im not even SKT fan, im lpl fan. But SKT is insanely good and if you are denying that, you need to get your brain checked.
[2:28:27] Sing3d: JAG BibleThump
[2:28:36] wojoo123: was game 1 close ?
[2:28:46] Benchung: @wojoo123 NO
[2:28:48] xinhaochan: pretty close
[2:28:57] xannygo: @adroit5927 LUL Im a big SKT fan, and im still skepticall untill they actually prove themselves, outside of the LCK
[2:29:02] samgreig98: Nah, got to 20 minutes and was always LBG
[2:29:06] carryme40: @adroit5927 skt is playing against noob teams, it mean nothing
[2:29:10] adroit5927: theres a reason why LPL has never won against Faker at worlds
[2:29:21] WildRafa: Lwx?
[2:29:28] ig_forge: g2 can never beat ig cuz ig is not going worlds
[2:29:30] wojoo123: lol

[2:30:19] vitomxdd: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:30:27] adroit5927: not saying SKT is the best team in the world and LPL can definitely beat SKT in bo1 but come bo5 i am highly skeptical of any LPL team being able to match SKT or G2
[2:30:37] kiyoeyoshioka: @d44kt besides IG EU beated the other 2 LPL teams last year wtf
[2:30:41] Sing3d: 0 kills ResidentSleeper 💤
[2:30:50] leronTTT: CS OMEGALUL
[2:30:52] FoxMulder4: Gimgoon is so bad

[2:30:58] xannygo: I can agree with that atleast
[2:31:00] adroit5927: IG was the only LPL team that won worlds because their solo laners are god tier last year
[2:31:02] ああいうえお: NA can beat all
[2:31:04] kinghanamaru: bad ??
[2:31:04] 1kenn1: G2 will 3-0 RNG
[2:31:22] carryme40: no
[2:31:33] carryme40: rng fans want fpx to win. because that means when rng beat tes , they are guarantee a world spot..
[2:31:37] xqf052: still 0 kill ResidentSleeper
[2:31:38] hehexd69691: oh no is fpx choking again
[2:31:45] adroit5927: you wont ever see TheShy level dominance from top lane, Rookie clapping every other mid laner and jkl, a prodigy adc popping off when he gets fed
[2:31:45] Sing3d: what is doinb doing with his right hand? 🤔
[2:31:49] MistuuhPaper: well looking at the game 3 of SKT v GRF, SKT can't handle early skirmishes well. Which is kinda G2 so they should do well against SKT and then close out MIdgame
[2:31:49] 1kenn1: was Neeko banned this game
[2:31:57] Yorthanzen: game 2 blg or fpx ?
[2:32:08] YSZN: @adroit5927 also if i recall ning had the series of his life during worlds finals
[2:32:09] adroit5927: you wont get that from the LPL for a long time, best chance is make a super team
[2:32:18] ig_forge: blg 3-0
[2:32:27] vitomxdd: EZ4BLG LWX so bad SeemsGood
[2:32:40] adroit5927: @thisisdedication yeah Ning was legit smurfing in the finals against broxah
[2:32:41] xannygo: @thisisdedication A win is a win, you can't take that from anyone.
[2:32:43] MistuuhPaper: btw who was the favourite in this series ? FPX ?
[2:32:50] adroit5927: broxah couldnt do shit to countergank
[2:32:54] domax12: yes @MistuuhPaper
[2:33:02] dakt4r: @MistuuhPaper FPX 3- 0 BLG was the prediction
[2:33:06] MistuuhPaper: Broxah sucks lmao
[2:33:13] carryme40: poppy are oom already
[2:33:19] ig_forge: blg has no fans
[2:33:27] adroit5927: lmao Broxah would clap these junglers easily
[2:33:30] carryme40: @d44kt i predicted 3-1 fpx, i gave blg some respect
[2:33:39] Benchung: broxah LUL
[2:33:46] Benchung: broxah is a joke
[2:33:47] vitomxdd: @ig_forge me

[2:34:10] dakt4r: @carryme40 predicting LPL seems meaningless tbh LUL
[2:34:15] ig_forge: ok :) :)
[2:34:17] Norgos21: Why FPX do not play their style of game?!
[2:34:19] adroit5927: watch G2 vs SKT and you'll see 2 world class junglers go at it against each other
[2:34:20] Sing3d: monkaS
[2:34:36] xannygo: @1kenn1 You spend way too much time on reddit, its not healthy.
[2:34:38] carryme40: @d44kt actually i predicted LNG 3-0 IG while eveyrone was saying IG 3-0 LNG. and i was right.
[2:34:38] vitomxdd: @Norgos21 they can't
[2:34:41] MistuuhPaper: Honestly EU doesn't have really top tier ADC's
[2:34:55] Sing3d: LUL
[2:35:07] dakt4r: @carryme40 well you have 200 iq then LUL. what did you predict TL vs ig, just curious
[2:35:10] 1kenn1: Perkz only top tier adc
[2:35:16] adroit5927: look at these LPL teams, they are so sloppy lol
[2:35:28] dakt4r: @carryme40 I never thought TL would win
[2:35:29] carryme40: @d44kt i didnt' care about msi since rng wasn't there
[2:35:32] MistuuhPaper: Jankos is good. People say he's like a map hack. so he should be able to judge a game really well which is clutch against LCK teams espc SKT
[2:35:32] NexyeR_: Perkz is botlaner not adc
[2:35:34] leronTTT: well thats why we play 2 APC LUL
[2:35:36] adambuldozer: hans sama, rekkles, perkz, patrik, kobbe
[2:35:39] dakt4r: @carryme40 ok LUL
[2:35:47] adroit5927: watch RNG at MSI last year and how good their macro was and their control of the map and coordination
[2:35:50] BlacksSnow_: @floyd_stylee upset
[2:35:57] reynax33: @floyd_stylee they're good but not top tier
[2:35:57] carryme40: @d44kt i only predicted tournaments with rng. otherwise the tournament is not legit
[2:36:16] Benchung: @floyd_stylee rekkles patrik LUL
[2:36:23] YSZN: Asura would be the best adc in NA, is average where adc's are competent laners
[2:36:35] samgreig98: Khan 0/6 hahaha
[2:36:38] adambuldozer: if they are not top tier then who is? rekkles is top tier since i dont know, 5 or 6 years
[2:36:41] dakt4r: GRF wins LUL
[2:36:42] NaMeiiii: KHANT LULW
[2:36:43] 1kenn1: Doublelift best adc only in NA
[2:36:51] MistuuhPaper: HAns Sama ?! LULW Rekkless played karma most of the split and only has like 2 good picks. Perks offers great flexibility but not really top tier
[2:37:05] ErminioOttone: 1 top?
[2:37:19] dakt4r: @MistuuhPaper perkz is not an adc really
[2:37:25] adroit5927: @MistuuhPaper yeah jankos surprised me, he's much smarter than i thought he was and also pretty decent mechanically, didnt think much of him and G2 until they beat RNG and even then they still got clapped by IG
[2:37:29] 1kenn1: Perkz was the best adc at MSI
[2:37:29] reynax33: @floyd_stylee he is tier below Uzi, Teddy
[2:37:30] xannygo: The gap is closed LUL
[2:37:31] Norgos21: Lwx is top right now
