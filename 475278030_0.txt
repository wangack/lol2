[0:11:45] Nitesearcher: FPX auto-qualified for Worlds right?
[0:11:53] Sov25: @Nitesearcher Yea
[0:12:06] Sov25: @Nitesearcher Enough points to qualify as 2nd seed even if they lose
[0:12:08] jfraks: this will be interesting
[0:12:24] Nitesearcher: So only way for IG to get in via points, is if TES lose here, and lose the 3/4 place match?
[0:12:25] jfraks: who u guys think is gonna win?
[0:12:25] AndrewIsPlaying: is rng out of worlds contention if they lose this bo5?
[0:12:45] marionette4033: @AndrewIsPlaying don't they get gauntlet?
[0:13:09] SweatyPalmzz: Just move on from IG
[0:13:19] SweatyPalmzz: They are gone for good
[0:13:51] jfraks: why u want IG on worlds i mean if they dont ahve the level who cares

[0:14:03] 21044275: HeyGuys
[0:14:08] Sov25: @Nitesearcher IG is in gauntlet. Their best bet is for TOP to make finals so they can be the final boss in the gauntlet
[0:14:12] lKrermanex: song name?
[0:14:22] theviper12: lec PogChamp
[0:14:37] Sov25: @Nitesearcher IG can also be the final boss in gauntlet if TOP loses this match and the 3rd place match
[0:14:37] marionette4033: @AndrewIsPlaying i think if RNG lose this, but win 3rd 4th place match they still get gauntlet

[0:17:03] lanceryo: RNG<TES
[0:17:09] lipsnlegs: horrible music who tf picked it

[0:19:36] birmz_aaron_is_a_weeb: Why is LPL so bad compared to LCK ? RuleFive
[0:19:46] lipsnlegs: @21044275 they should win but idk its rng

[0:20:27] lipsnlegs: fl0mCode
[0:20:31] 21044275: $50 TES wins the series, $10 they win 3-0

[0:20:44] RyRyRobe: Woo winner goes to worlds...loser if RNG has to win third to make gauntlet
[0:21:00] jfraks: this will be 3-2 FOR RNG
[0:21:06] 21044275: RNG has the best chance to knock IG out, so its better for them to lose here
[0:21:20] 21044275: TES will choke vs IG if it comes to it
[0:21:28] lipsnlegs: worlds without iG wouldnt be bad
[0:21:48] 21044275: If IG make worlds I won't be watching worlds
[0:21:56] 21044275: I hate this damn team so much
[0:22:16] chughes3314: good
[0:22:23] jfraks: @21044275 why would they want to knock IG i mean they knock themselves
[0:22:25] lipsnlegs: They're fine but just dont deserve to be there
[0:22:32] lipsnlegs: has to be top rng or fpx
[0:22:32] RyRyRobe: If TES wins, JDG makes gauntlet
[0:22:46] 21044275: IG 100% deserve all the hate they get
[0:22:54] Nitesearcher: I mean, I'd say whoever wins gauntlet deserves to be there

[0:23:08] xjunior14: A INTZ vai amassar qqr um desses times que passe para o mundial

[0:23:15] jfraks: FNC did better this season losing the finals then the actual winner
[0:23:15] 21044275: TheShy ints, half his games, Ning doesn't practice, lazy as hell, ints so much
[0:23:17] gratopioouus: RNG BlessRNG
[0:23:25] 航航487: RNG no1
[0:23:34] Sov25: @21044275 Lets not pretend baolan isn't garbage LUL
[0:23:38] Nitesearcher: @chughes3314 You referring to my comment?
[0:23:39] 21044275: RNG is so much more professional than IG
[0:23:45] chughes3314: no
[0:23:52] 21044275: And yes, Baolan is more hated than Ning and Theshy @Sov25
[0:23:52] marionette4033: Didn't IG lose their coach?
[0:23:54] hallogenxd: EZ FOR TOP PogChamp
[0:23:58] jfraks: but RNG needs a good top and good drafts
[0:24:04] chughes3314: RNG has UZI and as an adc main i'll always idolize uzi and be partial to them bc of that
[0:24:06] marionette4033: @21044275 why is Baolan hated
[0:24:08] lipsnlegs: Worlds without RNG would be lame asf,
[0:24:11] goblinguy01: Isn't IG still ran by the players and Wang Sicong
[0:24:11] Nitesearcher: @marionette4033 Yeah, Coach Kim went to DWG
[0:24:23] CYBERBOOLI__xD: pepeD
[0:24:24] marionette4033: @Nitesearcher yes, an unfortunate loss
[0:24:28] inewara123: mlxd
[0:24:30] jfraks: RNG should let xiaohu play carries ...
[0:24:39] 21044275: @marionette4033 Weibo drama, he unfollowed former IG player Kid, a very nice guy, due to a very petty reason
[0:24:39] goblinguy01: I heard in 2018 worlds, TheShy picked Fiora when they coach said"No". He talked to Wang and sided with theShy
[0:24:55] Nitesearcher: @marionette4033 One of the LCK casters mentioned something about how the DWG players was an exciting opportunity for him.
[0:24:56] 취하라: Is FPX already qualified for worlds?
[0:24:59] 21044275: TheShy and Ning are 2 of the most unlikable pro players I have ever seen
[0:24:59] iloveuoo43: what is this song?
[0:25:08] rehash3d: FPX are qualified yes
[0:25:12] RyRyRobe: @choihara yes
[0:25:13] goblinguy01: IG seems like it needs more discipline. RNG coaches actually have some power
[0:25:13] marionette4033: @21044275 what happened
[0:25:17] lipsnlegs: Coaches never completely dictate whats in drafts though @goblibguy01
[0:25:18] 취하라: nice
[0:25:24] RyRyRobe: Winner of tonight also makes worlds
[0:25:43] goblinguy01: @lipsnlegs Not in China, but in other regions.Their strategist decides what picks are what
[0:25:43] jfraks: Winner of tonight plays the final against FPX right?
[0:25:50] RyRyRobe: If RNG lose, they have to beat BLG to make gauntlet
[0:25:51] rehash3d: yeah
[0:25:52] CriElly7: zao zi ge upup
[0:26:06] 21044275: @marionette4033 Baolan likes to call Kid as 443 (his dmg in a game) so Kid jokinly returned by wishing Baolan happy birthday calling him princess (baolan's nickname in the community)
[0:26:07] EzeroChalicer: if rng win this match, they gonna qualified world?
[0:26:10] Sov25: @21044275 I mean at least theshy can make his picks worse like he's getting pressure and leads. Ning tho is straight up inting.
[0:26:18] RyRyRobe: Yes @ezerochalicer
[0:26:24] 21044275: @marionette4033 Baolan being the sensitive guy he is, unfollowed Kid right after
[0:26:25] lipsnlegs: @goblibguy01 say again? are you saying in china the coaches choose or the coaches chose in other regions?
[0:26:32] CYBERBOOLI__xD: HYPE
[0:26:34] ProdigalChicken: I want RNG to go to worlds, but I want FPX vs TES lpl finals

[0:26:41] himself4396: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:26:42] EzeroChalicer: @RyRyRobe i can imagine edg already win gauntlet LUL
[0:26:42] Nitesearcher: @EzeroChalicer Yes, they'll have 100 points (10 from spring, and 90 for minimum 2nd place)
[0:26:43] Envoy_of_the_End: ResidentSleeper
[0:26:44] Sov25: @wedcf120 I don't think it would matter if they upgrade top. RNG still doing the same thing and ignore top/mid to get uzi fed
[0:26:53] hallogenxd: CAN IG STILL MAKE IT TO WORLDS ? PogChamp
[0:27:00] 아이리__종우: Only 1800 watching LPL ;p

[0:27:02] RyRyRobe: @ezerochalicer except edg is done
[0:27:05] marionette4033: idk how TES will perform in BO5 so many young players
[0:27:05] CriElly7: TES GivePLZ
[0:27:09] goblinguy01: @lipsnlegs China until late 2017 Coaches had 0 power, it was all player ran. RNG (I believe) brought the Korean staff to initiate some change into LPL culture. They wanted to win
[0:27:11] CYBERBOOLI__xD: MineCraft and LPL Playoff PogU
[0:27:12] Kyurssg: SourPls I WAS MADE FOR THIS SourPls
[0:27:17] EzeroChalicer: is edg good this season?
[0:27:18] Sov25: IG atm is in a TSM position where they are likely going to the final boss in the gauntlet
[0:27:26] marionette4033: @goblibguy01 in 2016 it was all Mata
[0:27:28] goblinguy01: RNG made a deep run into worlds with a more "Korean" style of coaching
[0:27:34] RyRyRobe: EDG season is over...can’t make gauntlet
[0:27:34] 21044275: Ning is a lazy piece of cr*p that doesn't practice while inting, it takes until they forcibly benched him until he starts practicing
[0:27:38] goblinguy01: 2017, they had Heart and Firefox
[0:27:40] Kyurssg: wow im also playing minecraft while watching this
[0:27:47] EzeroChalicer: F for EDG
[0:27:57] jfraks: lul im playing TFT
[0:27:59] 21044275: TheShy is a cocky piece of cr*p that ints half his games and solo loses IG as many games as he wins them
[0:28:04] Asclepius_97: 30min?
[0:28:08] 21044275: Jackeylove remains IG's only likable player
[0:28:14] Asclepius_97: sounds about enough for a tft
[0:28:16] lipsnlegs: RNG shouldve won 2017 worlds and 2018 but that does mean coaches should soley dictate draft, and we have no clue what goes on
[0:28:24] CriElly7: z
[0:28:24] Sov25: @goblibguy01 Yup you're right. At the last asian x games, KR community got mad that they still used a KR coach for those games since they ran with a full RNG roster
[0:28:28] lKrermanex: @KyurXP1 and me programming xd
[0:28:35] goblinguy01: We all know Heart isn't good at drafting Kappa
[0:28:38] goblinguy01: Look at EDG this year
[0:28:41] EzeroChalicer: feels bad to jkl, stuck with alive shield and ward
[0:28:45] marionette4033: @21044275 JackeyLove draven so scary in solo queue my gosh hope he finds a better team
[0:29:01] Sov25: @lipsnlegs Hard disagree on RNG winning 2017 worlds. The fact that SKT won with bang slumping so hard in an ADC carry meta says enough. Uzi wasn't good enough in his meta.
[0:29:31] goblinguy01: I mean JackeyLove can go any team at this rate. Not sure Wang Sicong is willing to lose a player he molded for IG.
[0:29:42] marionette4033: true
[0:29:42] 21044275: As much as I wanna defend RNG in 2017, Uzi lost the 1v9 game to Faker
[0:29:43] PoliticalMuffin: casually ignoring that the rest of SKT is ridiculously better than the rest of RNG??
[0:29:52] Asclepius_97: whats the condition for rng to get into worlds
[0:29:53] dantmtop: @marionette4033 implying JL is too good for his team ahahhahahah LOL, literally wasnt among the most important 3 players when they won worlds
[0:30:13] RyRyRobe: @asclepius_97 win tonight or finish third to make gauntlet
[0:30:13] marionette4033: @IMemeking what about literally all the other games played
[0:30:14] goblinguy01: JackeyLove rarely Ints now 4Head
[0:30:15] Sov25: @PoliticalMuffin SKT had blank int some leads and had to always come back from deficits with bang already losing lane for the most part.
[0:30:24] KimiRhythm: @imemeking go watch ig vs kt pls :)
[0:30:46] Sov25: @PoliticalMuffin SKT played blank for the first 4 games and won game 4 and still subbed peanut. As an skt fan, the team wasn't as good as you think it was.
[0:31:00] dantmtop: @KimiRhythm go watch whole of worlds lmao, not saying hes bad but rookie theshy and ning were more important for IGs success at worlds
[0:31:02] 21044275: It honestly baffles me that IG still has fans, most unlikable team in LPL by far
[0:31:06] fiawedone: that SKT VS RNG series in 2017 was a fucking nightmare
[0:31:20] marionette4033: @fiawedone it was for me lol i'll always remember it
[0:31:23] KimiRhythm: @imemeking yeah i did and i disagree
[0:31:26] fiawedone: They let faker pick Galio 5 Games in a row
[0:31:29] Sov25: @PoliticalMuffin Look at the stats for worlds, SKT had to play top side in an adc meta and got to finals with how broken ardent adc meta was LUL
[0:31:31] goblinguy01: TheShy has a lot of fangirls in NA
[0:31:39] squallff8: skt without mata OMG
[0:31:41] goblinguy01: I see people trying to be like TheShy. Run it down or carry LUL
[0:31:51] 21044275: Why does someone as unlikable as TheShy have fangirls?
[0:31:53] KimiRhythm: @imemeking ning played really well in finals but wasnt amazing the whole tournament
[0:32:04] ShinsuZYX: Pog
[0:32:11] RyRyRobe: Samsung figured it all out during bracket phase any way in 2017 thanks to learning during group phase...RNG would have lost that final
[0:32:12] dantmtop: 4Head
[0:32:21] hallogenxd: THESHY 2 BO5`s FLUKE AT WORLDS ON JAYCE AND HE IS THE BEST EleGiggle 4Head
[0:32:59] Sov25: @RyRyRobe Who knows. Apparently SKT were hard stomping SSG in scrims but Bang wanted to pretend he can contribute LUL
[0:33:01] EzeroChalicer: actually, what happened to IG?
[0:33:15] wuleiespanyol: IG is trash
[0:33:18] Sov25: @EzeroChalicer Meta change and ning went garbage status
[0:33:22] goblinguy01: I mean if you look at NA, how many of players play like NA? Very few. They are either imports or play aggro like theShy
[0:33:38] goblinguy01: That's why Na is bad. They copy styles of better players instead of trying to make their own.
[0:34:08] midnightblitz83: I NEED MY ANIME PogChamp
[0:34:10] goblinguy01: Clutch and TSM for most of 2018 were Budget IG LUL
[0:34:18] Sov25: @goblibguy01 They had one meta they were good at but riot changed it
[0:34:27] Sov25: @goblibguy01 If you remember lane swap meta in s6
[0:34:28] goblinguy01: The Korean team beat the Chinese team OMEGALUL
[0:34:49] Kyurssg: FeelsGoodMan

[0:34:54] nextspark0: world final : ig vs g2

[0:35:28] nextspark0: LCK so bad ......
[0:35:29] goblinguy01: No way DamWon randomly gets bad in a week
[0:35:29] himself4396: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:35:45] Sov25: @21044275 I mean even in MSI when the meta was faster they still made other top teams play like that
[0:35:45] goblinguy01: If SKT was in the LPL, they couldn't beat 1st round lol
[0:35:46] 21044275: SKT is not good, rest of LCK just bended over really
[0:35:57] SweatyPalmzz: I'm gonna root for EU teams for the first time this year.
[0:36:04] goblinguy01: SKT could be 8th at best in the LPL. That shows how strong LCK is
[0:36:11] Sov25: @21044275 I mean did u see LPL? Bounced to TL in semi finals of MSI and got clapped at rift rivals LUL
[0:36:13] RyRyRobe: G2 has some problems surfacing. The FNC series yesterday was not a good sign.
[0:36:18] 600APMJanna: AYAYA
[0:36:21] chad_from_antarctica: SKT WON BY THE SCRIPT BTW LULW
[0:36:22] superdinooo: RNG won , i know because its scripted LUL
[0:36:23] Axiomaya: god i love the conversations in LPL chat
[0:36:24] 21044275: DWG, Sanbox and GRF just let SKT do whatever the fuck they want
[0:36:27] Tretharen: Knight9 and Doinb at Worlds is gonna be great
[0:36:32] RyRyRobe: Makes EU look bad atm
[0:36:39] nextspark0: LCK will not come to the world finals. XDDDD
[0:36:44] PandaxParty: boxLURK boxLURK boxLURK
[0:36:52] Sov25: @RyRyRobe Still have no clue how FNC choked that easy 3-0
[0:36:57] Axiomaya: LCK, LPL, EU, and NA are all trash.. wildcards are gonna clap this year
[0:36:58] superdinooo: RNG will win , i know because its scripted too LUL
[0:36:59] 21044275: LCK teams wont make past quarter at worlds
[0:36:59] marionette4033: @Sov25 There's a reason IG didnt make it past first round of playoffs lol
[0:37:00] goblinguy01: Whoever plays Griffin at quarters (If they make it) will beat them 3-0
[0:37:13] Sov25: G2 looked garbage. Just that FNC has the metal strength of a baby who got their lollipop snatched LUL
[0:37:14] Xawlito: @goblibguy01 u talk too much for someone who has so low game knowledge... pls!
[0:37:14] goblinguy01: Griffin could legit get 3-0 by FPX, C9 and FNC at this rate. They choke LUL
[0:37:15] marionette4033: @superdino96 i hope so LOL
[0:37:24] 21044275: I predict worlds semi finals: G2, Fnatic, FPX and Mammoth
[0:37:39] Amnizulol: song name guys?
[0:37:41] goblinguy01: @Xawlito Please, go watch SKT vs. Griffin in regular season. Griffin did nothing for 30 minutes
[0:37:42] arcussma23: TES or RNG?
