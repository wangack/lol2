[0:08:24] RyRyRobe: If BLG wins, gauntlet is BLG v. TES with iG end boss. If TES wins, gauntlet is JDG v. iG with TES as end boss. LPL only does three team gauntlet
[0:09:03] RyRyRobe: Could have a spring finals rematch

[0:10:13] RyRyRobe: So FPX could be world champ
[0:10:35] oprutz: You think they're better than the Koreans and G2?
[0:10:35] casesquare: FPX or SKT

[0:11:14] RyRyRobe: Europe is not deep and going 5-5 in groups at msi only to beat a 4-6 liquid in finals doesn‚Äôt tell me enough
[0:11:30] oprutz: G2 are pretty good, but IG seems to be their kryptonite, because they depend so much on outskilling opps individuallly
[0:11:52] casesquare: G2 did beat SKT but all the things went in G2's favour
[0:12:03] RyRyRobe: What @the_most_interesting_guy said
[0:12:08] RyRyRobe: It was a bad series
[0:12:10] lol_lust: As someone who hasn't followed lpl. Why aren't IG doing so well atm?
[0:12:17] oprutz: @The_Most_Interesting_Guy TRUE, but i think g2 were trolling... First game at least for sure...
[0:12:20] Todeswucht: @casesquare Like G2 failing Sona Taric in the first game and starting the series 0-1? LUL
[0:12:43] casesquare: If meta changes and people will be able to get a read on G2 then it'll be tough

[0:16:48] sqradi: jdg is a goddamn embarrassment that got lucky
[0:17:15] oprutz: who's the best midlaner in the game?
[0:17:20] RyRyRobe: If BLG wins, gauntlet is BLG v. TES with iG end boss. If TES wins, gauntlet is JDG v. iG with TES as end boss. LPL only does three team gauntlet
