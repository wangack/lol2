[1:03:54] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: Well TSM does have a worlds contenders roster in my eyes. Kept the best solo laners in the league and upgraded every role. Kobbe outperformed every adc at worlds insane pickup. This TSM looks better on paper than FPX.. Bjergsen > Doinb, Kobbe > lwx and BrokenBlade > Gimgoon/Khan
