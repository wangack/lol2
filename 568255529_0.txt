[0:18:53] Hellojelly: orn is support rumble
[0:19:07] Clement_LoL: my guess is V5 gets hungry easily, so they pick 15minute comps, and go to dinner early, win or lose
[0:19:11] IKEAStoleMyWasher: Like LCK,LEC,LCS have perma banned ornn on 10.4

[0:20:29] highonwhimsy: in pro there are just mechanical gods who don't even into non-metas. don't even play enough soloq, don't know matchups, they actually rely on "coaching"
[0:20:47] Munchables: yeah for sure - very clear priority differences. best example is 0 zac in LPL and barely any seju
[0:21:12] IKEAStoleMyWasher: Also alot of Maokai
[0:21:12] najafan: @k0r3_ I assume at least SOME of that is because they were off for so long. But some of that is clearly stylistic differences.
[0:21:27] Clement_LoL: J4 is regarded as a better Seju, and I tend to agree
[0:21:35] Jadenchu_OwO: I need the spooky scarecrow
[0:21:37] Clement_LoL: much more consistent engage and better utility

But otherwise people can play safe and probably stylistically fare decently well. But it 100% depends on current balance.

[1:56:39] Brialashay1: so im highly curious why these dudes are wearing masks thinking that shit is funny
[1:56:43] Clement_LoL: @kitlit yes but the future can only be extrapolated from the past

[1:58:41] Cesth_: TK instead of Braum?
[1:58:46] Sigmaeta420: Or, you could not ever have it because it doesn't exist as we are told. It is nothing but seasonal cold and flu, and they are using that to mask the real cause, which is the widespread roll out of 5G.

[2:10:50] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: IG didnt deserve to win that. They might be the 2nd best team in the world last year but their performance has dropped by a landslide. If they indeed win the LPL and go to MSI nothing more than a 0-3 result awaits them. At this moment I can safely say C9 is indeed the best team in the world and will prolly win the grandslam cuz all their opponents play like... this.

[2:58:35] ThatTromboneGuy: @LmaoLp Yeah I can totally see that. The game was way simpler back then, and the whole casting scene was super underdeveloped. If that was the case it would make sense that two casters from other games could make it work with minimal knowledge
