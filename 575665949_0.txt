[4:01:53] StarSashimi: trans: asol pushing waves literally uses up half his mana bar
[4:02:07] hermeneutist: @cuprehan you always pick runes for lane, then adjust items for teamfight/macro
[4:02:13] highonwhimsy: arcade corki > corgi corki the former always loses in pro
[4:02:17] OGpronssiparta: sn got better draft
[4:02:23] hermeneutist: you can't reach mid late game if you have a shit lane phase
[4:02:23] cuprehan: but still corki has a lot of ad too

[4:03:09] iKFC: Who won draft
[4:03:11] cuprehan: i see. my top lane brain
[4:03:14] Slazll: yeah his dmg is like 80% AP
[4:03:18] icesolo123: aurelion one trick
[4:03:20] HUUUUURZ: AA dmg gets converted into ap
[4:03:23] alvinnrisk: Gave sol to a one trick lol

[4:04:20] StarSashimi: uzi is in quarantine now he is in shanghai
[4:04:22] Sergiotor9: T1 -8.5 @1.80 looking juicy after game 1
[4:04:24] alvinnrisk: No English stream thurs and Friday
[4:04:31] highonwhimsy: uzi is on neither team, i assume he is in china somewhere
[4:04:37] hermeneutist: casters take thurs/fri off
[4:04:39] StarSashimi: he was never in wuhan, he was in hubei but allowed to leave to go to shanghai and is serving quarantine now 14 days
[4:04:41] Cloud9212: poor Uzi GivePLZ
[4:04:44] cuprehan: he is still on rng roster
[4:04:48] hermeneutist: i think there might be OpalCasts today, haven't checked
[4:04:49] erenarslan99: i never get the chinese meta this guys always choose the heros that most of the people consider off meta.Why is that?
[4:05:03] icesolo123: @sergiotor9 how score sir??
[4:05:11] alvinnrisk: OpalCasts no game sound
[4:05:19] hermeneutist: @erenarslan99 the main reason is probably lpl tempo, which is much faster than most other top regions
[4:05:21] StarSashimi: @erenarslan99 nah its only because WE mid is a asol one trick LUL
[4:05:23] cptplanet89: blobs so loud
[4:05:27] highonwhimsy: uzi just had wrist problems i heards so he prolly got a fibercast

[4:38:40] taminhtuanti8: map 3 where to bet guys
[4:38:51] hermeneutist: WE's current roster not much experience, so i doubt they knew what to do when they start falling behind
