[2:06:20] twobitsgaming: C9 is insane. Wonder if g2's tempo could take c9 down though.
[2:06:23] highonwhimsy: i would love a world's c9 vs ES. but lck and lpl will ruin it. lec won't make quarters
[2:06:28] mrworldwide2025: C9 aren't that bad, I think they'd get a few wins in LPL
[2:06:29] Danificent88: ORNN OPEN NotLikeThis

[2:07:39] circ55: C9 is horrible. ES IG FPX TES EDG RNG JDG T1 GEN G G2 FNC ORIGEN would all 3-0 C9 you NA fanboys. NA just sucks C9 is bad AF

[2:08:12] TwoGunSabo: I don't have LCK taking it this year

[2:10:06] sks98k: LPL>EU G2>LCK
[2:10:12] Shaedeux: C9 would take a game or two. they'd be like 15th in LpL.

[2:10:55] wen1238: China=pig
[2:11:03] hotdogss: C9 would be top 2 in LEC but probably top 8 in LPL
[2:11:06] LoneBwoy: c9 would be a top 8 team
[2:11:09] 小さな脳: LCS is really competitive this season, look at TL, last season's best team can't even be qualified play off cuz other teams significantly improved
[2:11:15] fast_turtle15: there is no other na team that looks half decent. They don't know how to play game so hard to judge where C9 stand an dI wouldn't give them the benefit of the doubt.
[2:11:17] Przemysl15: @irageu78 oh you think the people in taiwan are the real chinese government too? :)

[2:11:42] twobitsgaming: NA teams can't decide what play style they want to play.
[2:12:08] circ55: NA strong lmao

[2:12:46] banjing15: T1 GENG ＞ IG FPX ES

[3:29:32] kyllereece: Omg bad
[3:29:46] icant_kekw: @jameson1227 they were afraid for some reason. That entire game in and of itself was just hilariously bad. It aint a nutty game at all
[3:29:54] niander: @natelessakauseless Lider is trash. Eika isnt much better but still
[3:30:02] AllDayBye: OMG BETTORS
[3:30:10] icant_kekw: @natelessakauseless Ask IMT themselves PepeLaugh

[3:30:46] AllDayBye: c9 might play troll?
[3:30:51] icant_kekw: @jameson1227 yes, a siesta game. still not nutty
[3:31:10] icant_kekw: @AllDayBye Hell no, c9 almost for sure will love the honor of taking out TL themselves
[3:31:10] Yolo_pete: Nah c9 would want their rival to be out of playoffs
[3:31:13] niander: @natelessakauseless he was awful in LEC, his champ pool was Yasuo and Irelia and he still ran it down 90% of times
[3:31:23] kyllereece: I’m curious idk if anyone knows the answer to this question but uh why is omg so bad
[3:31:38] icant_kekw: @jameson1227 why would you bet on TL when they can't even beat a solo q game together? PepeLaugh
[3:31:48] AllDayBye: @jameson1227 where u from?
[3:31:49] icant_kekw: @jameson1227 in the case of TL, you losing money was well deserved
[3:32:08] niander: How could anyone bet on TL LUL
[3:32:09] Shaedeux: @kyllereece Curse win trading is why.
[3:32:16] icant_kekw: The TSM bet was unlucky tho, I'll give you that
[3:32:18] AllDayBye: @jameson1227 bet after draft not reputation
[3:32:43] Hollow_Alliance: holy
[3:32:47] Yolo_pete: Even with good draft I dont think they can beat C9
[3:33:19] icant_kekw: the only good draft TL needs to beat C9 is to draft Xmithie LUL
[3:33:29] AllDayBye: @jameson1227 ahhhhhhhhhh!
[3:33:41] 03c63ef3: why aren't they killing each other
[3:33:44] Shaedeux: C9 should win, but I have this weird feeling TL will some how win...C9 will do some over aggressive mistake and it will Cascade from there or something.
[3:33:52] icant_kekw: is this game NA? ResidentSleeper
[3:33:58] Yolo_pete: Is this LCK? KEKW
[3:33:59] niander: @natelessakauseless why should teams care about soloq when he proved that in competitive play he is just bad. He was by far worst mid in LEC and averaged like 10+ deaths lol
[3:34:08] icant_kekw: @Shadow_steppe i wouldnt' bet on that feeling. TL can't even beat na solo q together as 5
