[2:43:13] Kuuguya: @prettyboy93 top down. Sett super huge vs Ornn, although ornn can R multiple. Elise is garb only unreliable E, gragas is huge with aoe cc and separates teamfight. Grag counters pantheon since he can split the fight. Irelia can literally 1v4 (if ornn isnt there) because LGD has no reliable cc after Varus ult (which irelia can cleanse). Kaisa more safe than varus.
