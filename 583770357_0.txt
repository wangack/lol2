[1:22:12] irlgigachad: also imo, light>asura, asura is a kaisa abuser and bad at lane, if my memory is right light has a strong champ pool for this meta
[1:22:20] hermeneutist: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw lpl weibo posted RNG starting roster: it's still betty

[1:32:10] Thefourthdimensional: @rustythecaster it seemed like the auto went though like a full second after the flash, was that a visual bug or am i just not payibg enough attention?
[1:32:19] irlgigachad: did anyone see dig wants to get rid of huni? does anyone think an lpl team would waste money to trade for him? suning or rw huni might make sense imo

[1:34:20] ultranovel: LNG can still win just farm for late game
[1:34:23] hermeneutist: honestly SN could loan 705 from JDG and still get an improvement
[1:34:24] icant_kekw: @0024 you also fail to mention that with the whole Corona situation, it'll still be hard to commute to there. plus, evne if Huni arrives, he'll have to isolate himself
[1:34:30] KEKW_Vindicator: @highonwhimsy truuuuu LuL
[1:34:31] icant_kekw: @0024 hence no.
[1:34:57] wjteoh88: @mangonovel just 322 show , dont think so much
[1:35:01] BlinkTSSF: So glad Zoom is back
[1:35:02] Clement_LoL: JDG has trained their top laners so well, morgan now 705, it feels like the org has a good culture
[1:35:09] todd_howard25: ooh wukong
[1:35:16] hermeneutist: flandre still rushing bork eh
[1:35:17] 牛清: yes
[1:35:19] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw i guess, just trying to figure out if there is anywhere that wants him. His stock is insanely low
[1:35:19] fast_turtle15: Suning should just play Bin FeelsWeirdMan
[1:35:20] wjteoh88: that odds already tell we JDG ez 2-0
[1:35:24] highonwhimsy: @KEKW_Vindicator i'm not watching lck cause zoom
[1:35:29] StarSashimi: must be principal zoom schooling top laners SeemsGood
[1:35:31] tttttv6: o zoom is back Pog
[1:35:48] irlgigachad: @Grim_Thoughts idk about that bin seems like a soloq god that isnt translating to pro gameplay
[1:35:57] Seigraine: @Clement_LoL Does JDG have top experienced coaching staff? Maybe it's a C9 situation with having 3 top laner coaches
[1:36:07] Seigraine: top lane*
[1:36:20] icant_kekw: @0024 yeah I get it, but it's gotta be a realistic expectation. From what I can tell, Huni won't get many offers as a starter, much less overseas
[1:36:43] Clement_LoL: @DRX_Yeji coach homme was a top laner
[1:36:51] Clement_LoL: that could be a reason
[1:37:10] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw hes way better than biubiu and bin though and its a roster that can win
[1:37:11] zaldad: how does Loken got 0
[1:37:13] hermeneutist: i don't they swapped for lane matchups... they swapped cos they were giving up top t1 and long lane allows kass to farm more safely
[1:37:18] Dunwall5: Zoom is back monkaS
[1:37:30] irlgigachad: but yeah we might see huni in turkey if he wants to start
[1:37:31] alexis00777: 4 kills 10 mins must be LCK LUL
[1:37:40] Seigraine: @Clement_LoL It does make me excited to see how they shape up in Bo5s in playoffs later on
[1:37:44] RustyTheCaster: when only 1 team shows up it's hard to have more than 4 kills
[1:37:46] zaldad: u mad Alexis
[1:37:57] hermeneutist: wait, i just noticed LNG is playing light...
[1:38:07] irlgigachad: light>asura
[1:38:08] hermeneutist: asura benched?
[1:38:15] icant_kekw: @0024 again, the expectations should be realistic given the situation. And you're assuming Huni to be in peak form, when that isn't the case right now. Plus, shoving Huni in right before playoffs is a disastrous idea
[1:38:18] Clement_LoL: if you can't their egos I'm pretty sure LNG has died many times this game already
[1:38:21] Clement_LoL: count
[1:38:22] RustyTheCaster: social distancing respect my distance @tfblademom
[1:38:27] nekomoemoe: zoom cheated on his exgf
[1:38:28] hermeneutist: asura is pretty meh, but i wouldn't say light is better
[1:38:42] ultranovel: @nekomoemoe damn
[1:38:46] Seigraine: @hermeneutist Is that Light from LCK? Or LPL?
[1:38:54] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw ehhh its an okay idea imo if they want to compete for summer/worlds esp given the point system structure
[1:39:17] alexis00777: LEC>LPL
[1:39:18] ultranovel: INTING LULW
[1:39:22] nicholas_hagel: Jebaited Jebaited Jebaited
[1:39:24] puff400: LUL
[1:39:29] Clement_LoL: we back on the board bois, LNG yeah~~
[1:39:29] hermeneutist: @DRX_Yeji lpl light... he has a chinese name
[1:39:36] グラビーファンズ: zoom screen..
[1:39:39] hermeneutist: Wang Guang-Yu
[1:39:44] icant_kekw: @0024 i guess, but huni has never played in China, and he'll have less than 5 months to build synergy with a team, especially when limited in English.
[1:39:49] Seigraine: Gotcha
[1:40:00] h011ywood: is jackylove gonna play for TES tonight
[1:40:10] icant_kekw: @0024 And with what Huni has shown in NA, the offer is definitely not worht it imo.
[1:40:13] highonwhimsy: @alexis00777 you saw g2-3 two days ago and think they are good? :/
[1:40:16] laurakumi: mayb
[1:40:19] Violetls: jackylove retired
[1:40:25] hsuchihmo: no he cant play until 11 days later
[1:40:32] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw huni knows english, sofm knows english sofm will guide him :) but yeah this is likely not happening
[1:40:37] Gosu_Bws: @alexis00777 Did you watch the LEC games today? So bad lol
[1:40:41] laurakumi: he in tes
[1:40:42] hermeneutist: G2 aren't bad, they're just horrified by MAD's lpl style LULW
[1:41:07] melodicwind: @G2_LOST_TO_W KEKW
[1:41:08] hermeneutist: G2 LOST TO SATCHEL CHARGE KEKW
[1:41:21] highonwhimsy: g2 are generically ok for western teams and dont's have an adc
[1:41:33] icant_kekw: @0024 yeah sadly. Also gotta consider how huni will interact with the others too. the time it'll take to build synergy + the time it'll take to perform well together is just not worth the investment
[1:41:39] Seigraine: I just realised that JKL join TES
[1:41:39] Thefourthdimensional: Huni is a weird one, he can look like absolute garbage one splkt and a world class top laner the next, i dont thinm he's a super gokd pickup right now though
[1:41:40] ultranovel: Mad lion drafting like FPX against G2 in 1st game was fun to watch LUL
[1:41:45] kepzzz: can kassadin carry this game?
[1:41:58] Clement_LoL: this is one of the most scaling kass builds we've seen, a lot have been skipping rod for GLP
[1:42:07] MYSTERI0X: G2 just cant win vs naut mid
[1:42:09] ultranovel: @kepzzz easily if it went 40 min+
[1:42:12] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw oh yeah i also thought VG huni and maybe kkoma could get good gameplay from him?
[1:42:23] hermeneutist: nice golds
[1:42:23] kepzzz: even with mountain soul on JDG? @mangonovel
[1:42:23] puff400: gold diff yikes LUL
[1:42:25] Seigraine: @Clement_LoL Will he even make it to late game tho?
[1:42:29] BlinkTSSF: @Clement_LoL really? I don't recall any building GLP but maybe
[1:42:40] Clement_LoL: well he sure as hell ain't having an early game
[1:42:47] zzcmlxg: LUL
[1:42:48] BlinkTSSF: lol
[1:42:48] highonwhimsy: caps is a worse adc than perkz, also a worse mid than perkz. g2 are overpaying for mids
[1:42:51] ultranovel: rng won with a tarsh kass like being 6k behind @kepzzz
[1:42:57] BlinkTSSF: ZOOOOOOMMMMM
[1:42:57] Violetls: terrible
[1:42:58] icant_kekw: @0024 VG are in a good spot right now, no reason to abandon what works
[1:43:01] nhoka_: why would you dive a morde with ult??
[1:43:02] hermeneutist: he can get even more scalingier by buying mejais LULW
[1:43:03] Seigraine: BM flash xD
[1:43:05] TronHammer: hoooooooooly sarahj2LUL
[1:43:05] Thefourthdimensional: Huni did perform decently on SKT so reuniting with Kkoma might be a good thing
[1:43:06] fast_turtle15: Zoom draws so much pressure holy
[1:43:06] Dunwall5: Pog
[1:43:07] mchickencraftv2: Mountain soul so pog for jdg
[1:43:09] cswarrior: lol
[1:43:12] Gosu_Bws: waste of flash but still outplayed lol
[1:43:16] lkyfs: xx
[1:43:16] kepzzz: nevermind. LNG too bad.
[1:43:17] puff400: LMAO
[1:43:20] icant_kekw: @0024 huni got connections with Kkoma sure, but Kkoma isn't stupid to accept Huni midway through the year
[1:43:33] fast_turtle15: Cube > Huni
[1:43:35] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw "good spot" i disagree if you arent in a playoff spot and competing for worlds you're not doing good
[1:43:37] firechicken177: @kepzzz remember LNG 3-0 IG last year LUL
[1:43:40] laurakumi: nice zoom
[1:43:47] highonwhimsy: also @RUSTYTheCASTER western fans <3 zoom
[1:44:14] BlinkTSSF: LPL so stacked rn, FPX, IG, ES, RNG, TES all gonna compete for those 3 world spots
[1:44:38] Gosu_Bws: Agree. Too many good teams in LPL right now
[1:44:39] icant_kekw: @0024 well they recently beat Estar and I think VG will make it to a playoff spot. Sure they're probably not the best team, but you're really underselling so many factors just based on the hypothetical that Huni will join an LPL team overseas
[1:44:43] ultranovel: lec looks bad this year
[1:44:46] highonwhimsy: @BlinkTSSF yeah, pretty much
[1:44:47] catslayer7: monkaHmm
[1:44:51] ultranovel: lcs looks strong hough
[1:44:51] i_am_L_: how on earth did lng go from somewhere in 6-8th place almost taking out ig to this
[1:44:52] Clement_LoL: lel, triforce trundle
[1:44:57] KEKW_Vindicator: Ding dong with zoom is better than ES and TES
[1:44:58] Seigraine: If ES doesnt boom in playoofs then i think current IG FPX and ES would be worlds contenders
[1:44:58] icant_kekw: @mangonovel Kappa
[1:44:58] kepzzz: ES already showed their true colour last match against RNG> i dont think they got a good chance @BlinkTSSF
[1:45:00] MYSTERI0X: Ap0? ratirlL9
[1:45:04] Gosu_Bws: LEC actually looks so much weaker than last year lol
[1:45:07] fast_turtle15: LCS would stomp LPL Kappa
[1:45:08] hermeneutist: omg this trundle gonna be better than hyli's
[1:45:17] kepzzz: Kanavi Kreygasm
[1:45:20] BlinkTSSF: @kepzzz they're all basically rookies, the more experience the better they'll be
[1:45:20] burnswin: NA is also looking really strong. if TL finished 9th, that tells you how strong the league is
[1:45:25] h011ywood: didnt RNG beat ES recently
[1:45:31] ultranovel: no i am not joking lcs may defeat lec his year
[1:45:35] 澀澀母莎奈朵: XX?
[1:45:44] Thefourthdimensional: @0024 Thats not necessarily true, some players do perform well while held back by their team, i dont think thats whats happening to Huni though
[1:45:46] icant_kekw: @h011ywood 2-0 with the same picks LUL
[1:45:48] puff400: LUL
[1:45:48] nhoka_: @mangonovel LULW ?
[1:45:53] puff400: NA ult
[1:45:56] Seigraine: They did, but you could see it as a rock paper scissors as ES made IG look like a LDL team
[1:45:58] Gosu_Bws: @mangonovel I wouldn't doubt it. LEC games today and yesterday were so terrible
[1:45:59] BlinkTSSF: I think C9 is better than any LEC team but idk bout rest of NA they troll too much
[1:46:02] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw sure its good for VG standards, kkoma teams are historically worlds appearing. I just mostly want to see the strongest teams possible
[1:46:08] MYSTERI0X: @mangonovel you mean C9. lcs is still shitt as league in general
[1:46:08] kepzzz: maybe they can be more dangerous at summer split. feels like now not that much they cant do @BlinkTSSF
[1:46:08] alexis00777: G2 just unlucky next worlds g2 3-0 fpx
[1:46:13] highonwhimsy: the world loves zoom tbh. he's kinda close to theshy
[1:46:34] icant_kekw: @0024 i know. but you're not getting that with a coinflip huni and a huni that has to adjust to Chinese environment especially with the COVID-19 situation
[1:46:39] BlinkTSSF: @kepzzz come on man they slapped IG lol RNG isn't a slouch team either
[1:46:51] firechicken177: TL LOST TO SOLOQ KEKW
[1:46:55] Gosu_Bws: Stop talking about Huni lol. Guy is washed and can only pop off in NA
[1:47:02] lastsurpr1se: @alexis00777 lmfao
[1:47:06] chungshik200: lng byebye
[1:47:12] kepzzz: yeah. but after watched them yesterday against RNG, i feel their win against IG & FPX more like a flukes. xd
[1:47:14] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw but they're gamers though and they have kkoma who he knows, chieftan and dean who could help
[1:47:14] nekomoemoe: i think foreigners cannot enter china now
[1:47:23] HystericsCasts: correct
[1:47:23] Seigraine: G2 with Caps in bot isn't gonna touch FPX
[1:47:26] fast_turtle15: I expect ES to get stomped by experienced teams in playoffs but that's ok
[1:47:28] tttttv6: zoom isn't particularly well known tbh. he hasn't been international which is where most people see chinese players
[1:47:28] hermeneutist: as usual, fake lpl fans talking about lcs/lec more than the current game
[1:47:31] Seigraine: They were better off with Perkz in bot
[1:47:32] Violetls: why no lck team wants huni
[1:47:32] ultranovel: @Run1tDownBot that guy is trolling he says same thing in every chat
[1:47:35] HystericsCasts: borders closed
[1:47:37] alexis00777: 6 kills 20 mns must be LCK LUL
[1:47:50] icant_kekw: @0024 Again, Huni has VERY little time to synergize with his team. He may have connections with Kkoma, but what about the rest of the team?
[1:47:57] highonwhimsy: seriously chat game 5 of mad lions vs g2-3. that was a 1013 fiesta
[1:47:58] Gosu_Bws: LNG games always boring
[1:47:58] hermeneutist: ES has many ex-RNG org trainees, so maybe RNG seniors just know how their juniors play
[1:48:15] highonwhimsy: *2013
[1:48:16] Clement_LoL: the silver lining is this is a BO3
[1:48:23] Thefourthdimensional: @violetls Because he's a wildcard, you never know if he'll pop off or int the split
[1:48:26] BlinkTSSF: I mean by that logic the jr's should know how the sr's play too
[1:48:32] i_am_L_: LNG just completely collapsed this split
[1:48:33] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw there are teams that struggle spring and surge summer, plus it would be easier to try and get for the 2021 split if it works
[1:48:37] BlinkTSSF: @Clement_LoL that's not a silver lining I wanna see next series
[1:48:51] ultranovel: i hate this type of draft man just scale you win
[1:48:54] hermeneutist: juniors are less experienced, they're just trying to emulate their seniors
[1:48:55] Thefourthdimensional: he has a decentlt high ceiling and a super low floor
[1:48:57] ultranovel: so slow
[1:49:00] linoxugg: gg next
[1:49:01] icant_kekw: @0024 your entire assumption that Huni will make VG world class is based on his peak, but his current form is garbage. And if for the 2021 split, then they'll just try for Huni during the offseason, NOT during the midseason
[1:49:02] alexis00777: LEC>LPL
[1:49:05] Hollow_Alliance: @clement_lol do you think TES can be top 3 after JKL joining in ?
[1:49:12] 企鵝屍體: wuhan virus
[1:49:15] Seigraine: @Clement_LoL How do you think LNG would tackle game 2 draft after this early game
[1:49:20] ifeelsexytonight: this is boring
[1:49:26] icant_kekw: @0024 that assumption for 2021 assumes the rest of the roster will remain teh same. Again, you're making way too many assumptions just based on a wildcard in Huni.
[1:49:29] linoxugg: G2>all LUL LUL LUL
[1:49:30] zaldad: fax
[1:49:39] BlinkTSSF: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw if you want him for next season it's more than likely a team gets him this year and signs him throw next year
[1:49:45] fast_turtle15: LNG isn't the same without Sofm what a shame
[1:49:45] BlinkTSSF: Through*
[1:50:01] zaldad: loken and lvmao not even playing
[1:50:09] irlgigachad: my message was not unique? weird
[1:50:13] ultranovel: so boring man LNG are just farming
[1:50:22] icant_kekw: @BlinkTSSF I guess, but the chances htat Huni will be signed overseas during mid season with Corona going on? Nearly impossible
[1:50:24] alexis00777: LNG = LOYAL NEVER GIVE UP?
[1:50:26] Gosu_Bws: Back when LNG was Snake with Flandre/Krystal/Ella they were really fun
[1:50:34] donli2: why are other games postponed?
[1:50:35] Violetls: 6 kills in 25 mins, boring
[1:50:36] weilongm: just end it!!!
[1:50:41] Clement_LoL: Yes, I think with JKL TES can be a top 3, right below IG, FPX, question is how good will RNG be when uzi is back
[1:50:45] shiny_chocobo: Asura subbed out? LUL
[1:50:46] firechicken177: LNG = LAME NINJA GAMERS LUL
[1:51:02] theapplejuice69: 6 kills in 24 minutes. what is this, the LCK. PLAY CHINESE LEAGUE. REEEEEEEEE
[1:51:08] Seigraine: @Clement_LoL Is it just support diff at that point?
[1:51:12] kepzzz: PUT THE WARD FFS
[1:51:13] irlgigachad: another dream scenario is that lng realizes this roster is doomed and they trade flandre to tes
[1:51:22] BlinkTSSF: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw tbh, I could see a team signing and just holding him in america till next year, if nothing more than to ensure he's on their team next year, bring him over when able
[1:51:25] ultranovel: @AppIeJuice69 thank god we have rng vs ig that will be fiesta
[1:51:28] fast_turtle15: FPX look really scary right now, I don't think anyone beats them in a bo5 rn
[1:51:29] wjteoh88: LOL throw LUL
[1:51:30] icant_kekw: LNG AKA Lowkey Nice Gamers LUL
[1:51:33] Gosu_Bws: Taric ult needs a nerf
[1:51:33] ultranovel: FINISH IT
[1:51:34] zaldad: "lame noob gamers"
[1:51:38] highonwhimsy: @Clement_LoL there won't be an msi. plz share your expertie re: mad vs G2-3. i seems like an iron pretend fight. allso eg vs. fly
[1:51:39] wjteoh88: open war then only run LUL classic
[1:51:39] Clement_LoL: @0024 oh, I'd love that
[1:51:47] willfyc: NEXT GAME PLZ ResidentSleeper
[1:51:59] hermeneutist: uh taric ult is already really hard to land... nerf that and he's going unplayed in soloq
[1:52:04] theapplejuice69: @mangonovel BRO. i forgot. dammit. might have to take a 4 hour nap LOL
[1:52:09] alexis00777: LEC more entertaining than LPL LCK combined
[1:52:13] BlinkTSSF: Wait wait wait...you guys don't like 369 lol
[1:52:18] DeuceLM: LNG not even gonna try to play
[1:52:23] ultranovel: next game will also have same draft SO BORING
[1:52:25] icant_kekw: @BlinkTSSF Yeah Huni joining a team like CLG is much much more likely to join an LPL team esepcially with COVID-19
[1:52:25] Gosu_Bws: Flandre going to throw away his career on LNG/Snake. Such a waste
[1:52:30] shiny_chocobo: Zoom is back Pog
[1:52:33] highonwhimsy: there is a specific reason we watch zoom
[1:52:36] Rudiko: @clement_lol are you going to cast anytime this spring split?
[1:52:49] Clement_LoL: @highonwhimsy G2 had a lot of low level mistakes, but I think it showed a really interesting way to macro, they're constantly 1-4ing and trying to pick off the enemy 5 when they do vision
[1:52:51] zaldad: tf are they doing
[1:52:57] GucciTomass: LuvBrownL
[1:52:59] Violetls: zoom 1v5 ez
[1:52:59] fast_turtle15: ZOOM IS A BEAST
[1:53:06] shiny_chocobo: Pog
[1:53:07] ultranovel: GG
[1:53:07] wjteoh88: LUL
[1:53:08] irlgigachad: what a stomp
[1:53:12] donli2: gg
[1:53:12] xeminence: GG
[1:53:13] chungshik200: gg
[1:53:13] hermeneutist: nice flash light
[1:53:16] fast_turtle15: what an animal EZ
[1:53:16] DeuceLM: gg
[1:53:17] Clement_LoL: like honestly I prefer G2 macro then LNG commiting group suicide
[1:53:17] donli2: c8
[1:53:19] icant_kekw: ggez
[1:53:22] puff400: gg
[1:53:24] demiurggermanec247: DWG-T1 1-0
[1:53:25] wjteoh88: see ??? LOL classic throw skill , open war then no want fight only run
[1:53:30] willfyc: ZOOM PogChamp
[1:53:30] reak0n: hope JD can 2-0
[1:53:32] SensatiionuL: lng soooo bad
[1:53:32] icant_kekw: G2 aka Lost to W LUL
[1:53:33] fast_turtle15: LNG are so bad right now zzzz
[1:53:36] dmonblu: KEKW
[1:53:40] eltriani: gg ez
[1:53:41] Seigraine: @Clement_LoL At least LNG commited to something together
[1:53:42] icant_kekw: @wjteoh88 there was NO throw LUL
[1:53:44] weilongm: thx
[1:53:47] hermeneutist: @Clement_LoL not sure if light or craps better adc LULW
[1:53:48] rangsit01: GG
[1:53:53] DeuceLM: 11-1 pathetic
[1:53:54] BlinkTSSF: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw honestly I think if he could somehow get back into the LCK that would be best, I think he could 100% compete for KT top spot
[1:53:59] zaldad: loken with an insane 2/0/1 game
[1:54:09] zaldad: LMZO
[1:54:11] tttttv6: group suicide FeelsGoodMan
[1:54:15] gogators1977: Light out.... Asura in
[1:54:22] martin76b: 2-1 JDG
[1:54:29] alexis00777: G2 just unlucky vs MAD next time clear 3-0
[1:54:31] willgan0921: this will be a day that G2 realize they need a real ad carry
[1:54:44] Nukewar: Will RNG use Uzi today
[1:54:49] Sylardo: xx probabyl getting payid for this :D
[1:54:50] icant_kekw: @BlinkTSSF I guess going back to Korea may light a fire in Huni, but I only think that mid/low tier Korean teams would potentially sign Huni. Huni looked GARBAGE this split
[1:54:51] martin76b: G2 KEKW
[1:54:55] Violetls: isnt caps the best ADC?
[1:55:04] laurakumi: no uzi
[1:55:06] 猫叔不吃鱼呢: No uzi today
[1:55:06] Gosu_Bws: Caps is legit awful at ADC lol
[1:55:08] taylorcb: still betty
[1:55:15] hermeneutist: almost perf game
[1:55:17] Seigraine: Caps is like 4th best in LEC at best
[1:55:21] qwuilfish: zoom is back woah
[1:55:27] Gosu_Bws: 4th is too generous
[1:55:34] BlinkTSSF: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw huni has looked garbage every spring split imo and looks so dominant in summer, timing of form matters and if he carries it then thats all that matters
[1:55:36] Seigraine: Hence at best
[1:55:37] i_am_L_: LNG peaked back when kryst4l and flandre were both strong lanes and they had a jungle that actually did something
[1:55:40] 미고: tearsShampoo
[1:55:40] riot_games_belongs_to_cn: lose with kass FailFish
[1:55:44] tttttv6: yagao l Kreygasm
[1:55:50] Seigraine: And thats with him on mages
[1:55:50] tttttv6: lb
[1:55:50] Nukewar: not even close to faker stats FailFish
[1:55:55] puff400: if uzi back xiaohu about to go lulu mid again
[1:55:59] Seigraine: Minus ziggs
[1:56:09] icant_kekw: @BlinkTSSF but what do the other coaches think?
[1:56:10] fast_turtle15: can LNG just play their LDL team they look so bad this split
[1:56:12] Violetls: then why not move perks back to adc
[1:56:13] alexis00777: LEC>LPL
[1:56:26] LepantoKnight: ppl are overreacting, Caps is far from being "the worst adc" but he isnt the best either and G2 needs the best in each position for what they want to achieve so yeah
[1:56:28] Seigraine: Perkz didn't like being adc
[1:56:28] fast_turtle15: I'd be surprised if Perkz isn't adc next split
[1:56:30] irlgigachad: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw imo going to a low level team in kr might be a deathblow to huni's career if he underperforms. He should just smurf in turkey

[2:37:40] hermeneutist: also, cats and dogs being carnivores simply means they will never make sense as a source of meat... they're only eaten during famines when food is scarce, or as some sort of exotic food
[2:37:45] kdcmjk: Does that mean Ozzy Osbourne is Indonesian?

[3:18:57] GenmaichaLife: I wouldn't say C9 has zero chance to beat LEC...that is just ego talking. C9 is stronger than you think with how they play the map. I am not counting on them to win, but it's possible because LEC looks weak and G2 has such massive egos that get in the way
[3:19:03] aries_jw: @kenzy21st how can they be 2.0 if they're worse lol.

[3:23:36] LunaLovefine: @rum4k_ they still beat fnc and g2

[3:27:01] goblinguy01: @gosu_bws Have you seen my silver games xD
[3:27:04] pengu_lol: Rekkles is good at playing ADC except he is incredibly PASSIVE that they end up as a losing 2vs2 with him not backing Hylis' aggressive gameplay
[3:27:04] theeelegendhimself: oh yeah no @highonwhimsy C9 can't win agaisnt any good team

[3:27:44] HUN_Rawulf: @Malundus Selfmade is good, but if the opponents are banning Selfmades' favourite jungler champs, he is in trouble. Selfmade must practice for more champs.
[3:27:45] Gosu_Bws: I think Rekkles gave up on being a carry. Every meta he plays the dog champs
[3:27:47] GenmaichaLife: Lordofesports...I hope to see you in the chat when C9 goes to semis and LEC is eliminated lol
[3:27:57] firechicken177: Team*
[3:27:59] HUN_Rawulf: Example IG's strong is they have big champs pool.
[3:28:13] LunaLovefine: rekkles focuses too much on the big picture like thinking about winning worlds instead of taking it game by game and focusing on the present
[3:28:14] GenmaichaLife: To be good, you need to be able to have a champion pool...if you can get banne dout easily...then you aren't good
