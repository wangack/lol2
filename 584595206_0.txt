[2:47:20] xiaohan54321: IG members mostly all coinflip but baolan was the only one that wasnt a coinflip he's consistently shit
[2:47:23] using_user: is that what that pose is supposed to represent, claws?
[2:47:24] legionfromheil: 1-1?
[2:47:27] notuncledreww: V5 never had a chance lmaoooo
[2:47:33] notuncledreww: 2-0
[2:47:42] ultranovel: baolan was good man
[2:47:42] szechuan_pandas: Basically three teams in LPL were dominating, and ES loss 2 in a row which makes the standings even more interesting
[2:47:42] DaddyDiddy: Well I knew V5 wouldnt win but I needed SNG to win 2-0 for my parlay
[2:47:43] jezzajamo: @riotcorona they looked good before I switched appa üòÇ
[2:47:54] highonwhimsy: would v5 be top 3 in oce?
[2:47:55] Smart_420: they never even had a chance @jezzajamo
[2:48:01] ultranovel: not good like crisp but still reliable
[2:48:06] 5ympathy: did suning 2-0?
[2:48:12] szechuan_pandas: Baolan is shit
[2:48:13] Boogielol: yes
[2:48:13] Smart_420: would v5 be the top team in tcl
[2:48:14] ultranovel: yes
[2:48:18] 5ympathy: ty
[2:48:22] legionfromheil: da hek wasn't it something like 9-2 score
[2:48:23] jezzajamo: @riotcorona v ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[2:48:34] Smart_420: @jezzajamo zzzzzzzzz ResidentSleeper

[2:48:42] D1SOBEY: How longs the break?
[2:48:43] jezzajamo: Lesss go OMG thoooo!!
[2:48:45] xiaohan54321: he's the reason why jackeylove doesnt want to play on IG anymore, tells you a lot about how baolan is
[2:48:55] ultranovel: @D1SOBEY usually 5 min
[2:49:03] linoxugg: V0-12 NotLikeThis
[2:49:05] Le_Lion_Celeste: GG suning !!!
[2:49:06] kona309: @highonwhimsy using FBI and ryoma as a benchmark, I think V5 would be top 3 or top 2 in OCE
[2:49:07] AnOldDinosaur: HahaPoint V5
[2:49:09] coltluger: By the end of the season, it should be obvious Huanfeng is top tier. I was impressed by him last year in the LDL, thought IG would promote him to their first team
[2:49:13] NotOp: LUL right into naut knockup
[2:49:13] szechuan_pandas: A supporter who never protect the adc lolz that is baolan
[2:49:14] 1718056814: maybe LPL have 18team in summer or the next year
[2:49:23] Boogielol: puff is better anyway
[2:49:27] fast_turtle15: Baolan was only pretty good when they won worlds, Other than that almost every support in LPL >>>
[2:49:27] ultranovel: @xiaohan54321 prestty sure it sint it just a shit rumor otherwise he will still play for ig because baolan has been benched since forever
[2:49:28] D1SOBEY: @mangonovel ty ^.^
[2:49:40] fast_turtle15: yea Puff is a beast IG should be happy they have a stable botlane

[2:50:09] highonwhimsy: i cold see clg academy beating v5 in a b05. could be wrong, but hmm
[2:50:18] lolluxlol: Who won? SN?
[2:50:21] coltluger: @Boogielol lol no he's not. Puff is talented, but not on Jackey's level. Puff's upside is that he comes with Southwind as a package type of a deal - Southwind is way better than Baolan
[2:50:25] Suhlurpy: yea
[2:50:25] ultranovel: no v5 won
[2:50:35] jezzajamo: V5 2-0 @lolluxlol
[2:50:38] ultranovel: 2-1 was a close match
[2:50:52] szechuan_pandas: Baolan was one of the worst Supporter in the LPL last season

[2:55:29] szechuan_pandas: Ning‚Äôs girlfriend brought some shit into IG locker room, and Baolan just focused on his career outside LPL so that is why they are bad, especially Ning barely play rank and JG he still a diamond ELo
[2:55:30] Firewing5: Ig had a lot of issues at worlds last year, rookie wasnt looking prime, baolan was off his game and the jg problem was never resolved
[2:55:30] lockynsound: @veginey look at DL, ask the same question lol
[2:55:33] ultranovel: v5 thats why

[3:19:54] a11one_: @anolddinosaur yea that‚Äôs kind of what the whole series looked like except instead of Rogue just losing, they stayed focus, found a couple kills and objectives, and played through strong mid game comps to win out
[3:20:07] GrayGraySonSon: its the third dragon killed
