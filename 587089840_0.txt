[0:21:19] minimite1: valorant will die once the streamers stop getting paid to play it

[0:22:28] MilkInvictus: again - except pubg, because for whatever reason they eat that game up
[0:22:42] 3rrour: probably not gonna die that easy because rito will pay them to write fluff pieces about how revolutionary different systems are and its gonna pick up steam
[0:22:44] liverpool_numba1: Asian only play moba gam
[0:23:11] dl_na_uzi_lul: @MilkInvictus because it was super revolutionary unlike others which are either super old or super unoriginal
[0:23:12] 3rrour: wtf are these song choices?!
[0:23:24] 3rrour: i thought the idea was to get us pumped up
[0:23:28] MilkInvictus: but idk, i could see valorant taking over OW at least. OW esports is god damn dead, its an absolute fiesta and the handling of it is awful, Valorant seems quite fun to watch as its a mix of skill gunplay and fun abilities
[0:23:30] ngh95: bout time China disclosed how many cases of Corona virus they actually have
[0:23:44] MilkInvictus: i dont think any shooter will ever take over counterstrike in esports

[4:11:04] uyaulhiqungga: SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[4:11:24] RSKellz: @mistaRoy that would be hard though, because Kalista has that whole binding process
[4:11:33] highonwhimsy: lng has two names we know edg has one. but edg win. *shrug*
[4:12:10] highonwhimsy: cn soloq should be scouted better
[4:12:50] fast_turtle15: Sylas gets a bind and can use her ult on the teammate
[4:12:51] RSKellz: @mistaRoy just looked it up, Sylas starts with a black speak in the beginning just like Kalista and has to choose someone to bind to
[4:12:57] fast_turtle15: yes
[4:13:03] ezhach: If I recall correctly, if there is a Kalista, Sylas can bind it at the beginning of the game. Then Sylas can steal the ult and use it.
[4:13:14] dicco_33: gg
