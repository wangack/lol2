[5:17:25] shynorah: UZI WAS THE PROBLEM Kappa
[5:17:28] LeCarry: @Kullipilk LEC is literally only G2, maybe FNC counts as half a team
[5:17:32] BestIZedIZimbabwe: is uzi still stuck in Wuhan?
[5:17:34] PiNGtOuGE: Crazy LUL

[5:18:09] z_emm_z: g2 is legit shit KEKW
[5:18:09] Munchables: Guess they're not messing around since losing to LGD monkaS
[5:18:17] Gkitzo_: @Sourke i didnt bet on them then :P
[5:18:18] Sov25: @LeCarry G2 is essentially, on paper, their #1/2 players in each position on the same team. Still somehow got smashed by MAD
[5:18:18] z_emm_z: fnc is better KEKW
[5:18:19] theeelegendhimself: have to say EU is worse then LPL but it's not a bad region. it's the second best.
[5:18:22] ffffoodie: maybe uzi will retire
[5:18:24] cuprehan: @bestizedizimbabwe no the casters said he’s in Shanghai if I heard correctly. Point being he’s ready to go
[5:18:28] fast_turtle15: EU fans are you getting any of the FPX skins FeelsOkayMan
[5:18:32] hsymei: UZI is transferming into a broadcaster or streamer
[5:18:35] banjo6324: hahahaha
[5:18:37] fast_turtle15: I'm getting GP for sure
[5:18:38] Gkitzo_: Ult away KEKW
[5:18:40] bluegrassbat: LOL defensive ult malph
[5:18:40] Kullipilk: Just wanna say one last thing. the finals EU lost were very unlucky and on a different day it would have been 6-0 for LEC. LPL needs to accept EU superiority. this aram style clown fiesta is on par with NA, and we all know how garbage NA is. this is the year for G2 and FNC
[5:18:41] z_emm_z: no way, Caps is not top 2 ad
[5:18:42] Squidd6: malphite ults LUL

[5:19:01] Untrustworthy_Erosdeath: FULL ARMOUR VS WU/ZOE KEKW
[5:19:14] Sov25: @MGM4rk Yea with the role swap they def not top 1/2 for all roles. Somehow EU casters/analysts had caps top 3 all team as ADC XD

[5:19:33] ArishaTM: @LeCarry That's funny thing, G2 has never won vs IG xD
[5:19:33] Sov25: @MGM4rk Either LEC ADC are bad that caps is good enough to make it or they are delusional
[5:19:36] youcancallmet1000: I told you
[5:19:38] theeelegendhimself: ive been a fan of fnatic for my whole life, but u got to know LPL is first @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw
[5:19:43] narvuntien: OPL has enabled Wukong
[5:19:44] youcancallmet1000: This team is trash
[5:19:47] icant_kekw: @Hayzt G2 0-5 vs IG all time.
[5:19:48] cuprehan: NA and EUW are both annoying. But EUW think they have 12inches
[5:19:54] icant_kekw: @lordofesports Of course of course.
[5:19:55] boot_rotmg: Rawk sawlid
[5:19:55] fast_turtle15: Caps being voted top 3 adc is a meme
[5:20:08] varistw: atleast eu doesnt measure in inches and shit like this lulw
[5:20:12] z_emm_z: @Sov25 just delusional, been legit runnign it,goign off name value
[5:20:19] Gkitzo_: na > all yall
[5:20:19] theeelegendhimself: G2 won't do as well at worlds if Caps is their adc
[5:20:21] youcancallmet1000: Imagine playing RW
[5:20:24] cuprehan: @grim_thoughts maybe he is in EUW
[5:20:25] hermeneutist: at this point i think it's more reasonable to believe those "EU fans" are just troll bots
[5:20:28] highonwhimsy: >2020 ppl still watching lck ishggddty
[5:20:35] Hayzt: its ok guys NA will destroy LPL and EU will 3 0 NA ez clap
[5:20:37] l0rd_beerus: lmao I bet on RW to take atleast 1 game, but after this game, I can't understand why did I do it
[5:20:40] banjo6324: crazy go
[5:20:41] youcancallmet1000: IM SO PISSED MAN
[5:20:58] Gkitzo_: Rerinald is better than this ruby kekw
[5:20:59] theeelegendhimself: Caps is so bad at adc
[5:21:02] youcancallmet1000: stats should’ve told us RNG
[5:21:04] hermeneutist: maybe haro is doing a weiyan?
[5:21:05] titianger: 10:0
[5:21:09] deadbysunrisee: what is with Uzi ?
[5:21:14] Kullipilk: G2>RNG 3-2 :)
[5:21:17] cuprehan: No flame but seriously if RW was NA they’d be first seed
[5:21:19] youcancallmet1000: But being terrible at dfs you play RW
[5:21:22] Sov25: @MGM4rk Yea that happened in LCS. Some person named Bjergsen #1/2/3 mid and her twitter tag is bjergsen #1 fan
[5:21:30] Sov25: @MGM4rk No clue how some of these ppl have access to vote
[5:21:33] Hayzt: FPX would lose to SKT
[5:21:34] l0rd_beerus: whats with ADC no CS?
[5:21:38] icant_kekw: Lmfao which one of yall is Kinkmasterzulul
[5:21:42] Gkitzo_: @Lotuszyo Thats racist LUL
[5:21:42] rkload: @deadbysunrisee he has a wrist injury that gets worse whenever he plays, so they save him for important games
[5:21:43] fazed343: I mean its no 47%
[5:21:44] youcancallmet1000: I should’ve just withdrawn all my dk money
[5:21:48] ArishaTM: FPX losing to SKT? LULW
[5:21:55] youcancallmet1000: Instead I play cash with shitty RW
[5:21:55] sdpocket: RNG ResidentSleeper Clap
[5:21:56] z_emm_z: @Sov25 yea, heard about that, idk why media and randoms get to vote
[5:22:03] Kullipilk: LEC Rogue > RNG
[5:22:09] highonwhimsy: no flame but v5 would be t3 in playoffs in lcs, lec
[5:22:10] LeCarry: think about it. G2 literally has it's region's best player on every role, and they lose 3-0 to china. EU is just worse than LPL
[5:22:14] hermeneutist: doesn't reginald have a wukong skin?
[5:22:15] lDrizzyl: @youcancallmet1000 RW was never a cash play
[5:22:19] icant_kekw: Some random flaming me just because I said I'm a TSM fan LULW
[5:22:19] dackien123: TOP JUNG MID ADC SUP diff LULW

[5:22:31] deadbysunrisee: @rkload aha. ty
[5:22:37] ZZPulse: FPX 3:0 G2 PepeLaugh
[5:22:42] Sov25: @MGM4rk It's like MMA if you follow it. A ton of the early people in the scene(just like esports) are ppl with no credentials. Just be in the scene early is good enough for esports.
[5:22:44] Hayzt: splyce 3 0 fpw in grp

[5:23:39] Kullipilk: Uzi has been overhyped for all his life
[5:23:46] Sov25: @lordofesports C9 isn't that bad. Hell even RNG got 2nd seed at worlds and required CG to throw vs them LUL
[5:23:47] spuukinge: Plz RW die
[5:23:49] Gkitzo_: Hans sama he is really the greatest in lec atm but the finn guy on top lane is such a kekw
[5:24:00] hermeneutist: @cuprehan everyone knows that best EU adc is G0DGIVEN
[5:24:00] brandoniannn: yoink
[5:24:01] Munchables: 10 kills in 25 mins, this is the high octane LPL I subbed for Kappa
[5:24:01] jesussellscrack: i mean G2 lost to MAD lions LUL
[5:24:07] theeelegendhimself: C9 beating we omg and tes idk thats a hard sell C9 lost to TSM

[5:24:52] Sadwannabecloudvolcano: @banjing15 Ruby is from KR but never played for KR team
[5:24:53] tttttv6: RNG lost top tower. not perfect
[5:24:53] r8dar: actually really good that uzi is having a quality rest
[5:24:54] bluegrassbat: Betty is our future #RNGWIN
[5:24:56] CallMeFlurris: hans sama is not even close to be the best euw adc
[5:24:58] icant_kekw: @hermeneutist The guy left after I told him to tell me what the r word is
[5:24:59] youcancallmet1000: HOW CAN THAT BE
[5:25:01] zsergioss: if they can livwe 40min they can actually still win this :D
[5:25:01] jesussellscrack: uzi needs an arm transplant
[5:25:04] Munchables: RNG aren't gonna risk anything after their LGD series and have a poke comp. They're playing this well honestly
[5:25:06] theeelegendhimself: C9 isn't a good team everyone else in NA is just very bad so they look a lot better then they are. They won't get out of groups tbh.
[5:25:08] sqradi: PepeHands
[5:25:11] ZZPulse: @hotdogss caps will completely retired after laning against uzi Kappa

[5:25:25] Gkitzo_: theres no way rng losing this , this is not oceania or something
[5:25:26] Squidd6: why is betty and uzi is even on the same team
[5:25:31] BestIZedIZimbabwe: Uzi should retire he is always afk for 1 whole split. it's a joke he has superstar status like this
[5:25:32] jesussellscrack: V5>C9 LUL
[5:25:34] 羅馬生命鬥士: uzi has been taken by the china government
[5:25:34] Sov25: @jesussellscrack Isn't it because he lives in wuhan? He's quarantined i thought
[5:25:36] r8dar: ORANEGGGGG
[5:25:37] bluegrassbat: not having uzi is one of the best things for us. Xiaohu and Langx are getting the chance to carry
[5:25:39] fazed343: @cuprehan he prolly unironically thinks caps is better adc than uzi
[5:25:42] Kullipilk: @hotdogss to be fair Caps would beat doinb every regular matchup, they just cheese G2 and G2 had bad day. would the finals been the other day G2 easy 3-0

[5:47:07] narvuntien: @Sadwannabecloudvolcano I think it has a lot more to do with the academy system not being as good as the multiple LPL develop leagues, Challangers Korea or the EU country leagues
[5:47:28] hermeneutist: sounds like RNG is subbing in someone?
