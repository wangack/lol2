[0:06:11] rossapus: TES are good but eStar are slapping mad cheeks
[0:06:12] TozzyTV: Jinjiao going to slap
[0:06:14] zenovw: But I think Estar will still edge them in this one
[0:06:17] irlgigachad: @zenovw thinking in conspiracy isnt a good mindset, the level of competitiveness in lpl is high

[0:07:20] rossapus: Chat give v5 your energy
[0:07:22] 統神我愛您: Peanut vs Tian
[0:07:29] Nadro: #V5WIN
[0:07:30] zenovw: @0024 v5 have only won one map all split. It just shows how much discrepancy there is between them and other teams. If they suddenly come back and win two games, I’d be quite concerned. A chance against VG but I think BLG are in good form
[0:07:31] sundownser: yay LPL is gonna keep me up for another 5 hours
[0:07:46] juryoku_: pepeD
[0:07:47] OnelShot: will jackeylove be playing today?

[0:08:22] sundownser: it must be such a bummer to be on V5 :/
[0:08:24] jesussellscrack: fpx should 2-0 lgd
[0:08:29] zenovw: JKL is a must
[0:08:49] jesussellscrack: JKL and knight carry TES to 2-0
[0:09:03] Nadro: @OnelShot JackeyLove is Starting against ES
[0:09:04] zenovw: FPX will win easy
[0:09:24] degyver: yeah
[0:09:30] degyver: FPX = boss
[0:09:34] olddays: 2-1 fpx
[0:09:38] zenovw: LGD are in very bad form. After watching two maps where they were thrashed by BLG, I’m sure FPX will come up 2-0
[0:09:43] jesussellscrack: hopefully fpx still uses gimgoon
[0:09:49] OnelShot: @Nadro nice, thank you all for answering
[0:09:56] degyver: i dont know about that
[0:09:56] irlgigachad: @zenovw i agree that blg appears in form, but it takes a few teamfights and a player to popoff. I recall v5 winning a couple of teamfight/skirmishes against tes despite being somewhat far behind.
[0:09:57] sundownser: FPX will thrash LGD
[0:10:03] degyver: i think its best not to speculate
[0:10:09] sundownser: bet all your money on LGD
[0:10:15] Ariaflux: mon right side all win, tue left side all win, wed right side all win, so today left side all win LUL

[0:11:52] sundownser: damn its wednesday for me... isnt that enough for an english cast
[0:11:57] sundownser: for now lol
