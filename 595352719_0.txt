[0:20:49] Nitesearcher: @G2_FLUKE_MSl Yeah, KT vs DWG in 2hrs
[0:20:56] G2_FLUKE_MSl: V5 will destroy Vici quote me on this
[0:20:57] irlgigachad: many teams have their dreams rest on omg/we series where we wins
[0:20:57] zenovw: Yes. Rolster vs DWG @g2_fluke_msl
[0:21:09] rumble49: V5 were put into the league to allow free betting
[0:21:13] liverpool_numba1: V5 1-30 games, 0-15 series, 1baron 0 soul in 31 games.
[0:21:13] Zengaria: @0024 so if vg wins today and we beats omg theyre in the bracket?
[0:21:15] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Are either KT or DWG any good?

[0:23:23] Nitesearcher: He won't, IMO
[0:23:35] zenovw: JDG is seriously so good now though. On par with the top teams
[0:23:37] liverpool_numba1: Dont bet over 2.5 games on V5. V5 is a super team : 1-30 games, 0-15 series, 1 baron 0 soul in 31 games. How you bet on V5 LUL, just like diamond players vs challenger players
[0:23:39] SmogeChan: V5 BlessRNG
[0:23:48] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Yeah JDG is incredibly strong

[0:24:21] paoweelovesss: fpx vs rw 2-0
[0:24:34] pedrogza94: v5 will win 4Head
[0:24:40] liverpool_numba1: Flawless plays very bad in JDG
[0:24:43] paoweelovesss: suning +1.5
