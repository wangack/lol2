[0:14:14] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @imBlackViking Both are pretty good so no one knows for sure
[0:14:19] ibukizakura: LCK IS THE BEST TEAM TODAY
[0:14:25] psyhosiadacz: ResidentSleeper 💤
[0:14:29] ibukizakura: SKT NO.1
[0:14:30] irlgigachad: @imBlackViking on paper lgd, but v5 have been overperforming with good synergy

[0:17:20] corp0_: pepeD
[0:17:25] winwin311: pepeD
[0:17:28] irlgigachad: they could be, but they need to be coached up a lot, luckily it is still early in the split
[0:17:43] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Yeah still early but they could legitimately be the 4th seed
[0:17:49] adoroo: like they actaully made JDG work for that win , suning late just sucks , their early/mid is really good tho
[0:17:49] winwin311: losing Mafa has been hard
[0:18:20] winwin311: what song is this?

[0:26:43] R3dbullet: Go V5 BloodTrail
[0:26:44] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @ayoub_ammor Right now TES/JDG would easily do it. Probably FPX too
[0:26:55] AngryyWhopper: I'd be happy to have EU team at the final again even if they lose, whatever
[0:27:15] irlgigachad: @adoroo could be attitude or internal problems and yeah he played most of last split
[0:27:17] adoroo: FPX is honestly lacking communication it seems
[0:27:42] sundownser: are Chinese people allowed to have knives
[0:27:42] ayoub_ammor: @G2_FLUKE_MSl yeah right now FPX/JDG/TES are the best teams in the world
[0:27:46] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @adoroo Yeah but tbh FPX always had incredible coaching. They have a decent bit of time to get used to Khan
[0:29:26] lingeringxiii: is it english casting tonight
[0:30:39] adoroo: @0024 i see , i really hope to s ee him play but again , chenlun17 isn't bad , just slightly worse then other tops , but he has ALOT of potential @G2_FLUKE_MSl Ye that's what i mean , it seems like khan and tian are not on the same page , doinb also seems abit off for some reason

[0:40:52] Thythorns: is it english today?
[0:41:07] aetha24: @marcoslira2008 The one with v5 uniform
[0:41:25] irlgigachad: @adoroo it could be a coaches demand that he tries to learn it as well since it might open up more team comps and is viewed as strong in the meta.
[0:41:47] adoroo: @0024 nono , i meant was their synergy in pro play compare to soloq , mb , it really does seem off in pro play but alot of stuff can be happening in the background that we dont know off
[0:41:54] aetha24: Y’all I need know what the legend looks like bruhh
[0:42:35] 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈123: ?
[0:42:40] marcoslira2008: v5's and lgd's uniforms are pretty much the same, changing only the the colour
[0:42:41] aetha24: ate a badger for breakfast
[0:43:03] irlgigachad: @adoroo that, unsure of idk like i said it could just be late in the day or they really just are not where they should be since there's high expectations
