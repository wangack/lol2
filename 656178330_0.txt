[1:58:23] tttttv6: es vs rw 50 min game last split was pretty funny
[1:58:25] Munchables: @ChinoisGG not doing anything for 40 minutes then having 1 fight to decide the game =/= better gameplay. Slow doesn't mean good.
[1:58:26] BadBoyzSK: who won ?
[1:58:28] icant_kekw: @ccb6 go ahead and vomit ;)
[1:58:32] ccb6: neither of you have ever said anything insightful in over 2 years of casting LPL
[1:58:36] fzrdz: I think everyone agrees any LPL team is better than NA, except maybe c9 and tl
[1:58:44] ohlinsakarapovic: were casters in china?
[1:58:46] GeNeSy91: a good lee is just to find a good kick in team fight xD
[1:59:00] ChinoisGG: @munchables i never argued that that style is better in general compared to fighting but it definitely is still better than constantly fighting terribly
[1:59:01] GeNeSy91: LUL

[2:01:00] goblinguy01: The fact that TheSword lost Griffin the game solo was amazing.
[2:01:00] Zqy23311: @genesy91 yeah, but smlz's jhin was something u won't expect lol, just like jkl's draven
[2:01:03] superdinooo: I believe casters understand Chinese or not a bit

[2:03:31] sxlitvry: JackeyLove trollls too much. Opposite of Uzi in personality imo
[2:03:32] stinnytv: @rangedlegit you aren‚Äôt watching the same games I am if you think hope and Jackey are on the same level

[2:06:35] g0vernor69: who won
[2:06:36] goblinguy01: JLove hard carried IG to worlds in 2019 while Teddy AFK'd
[2:06:37] ohlinsakarapovic: Bdd is good rest is trash
[2:06:45] RangedLegit: @stinnytv In no order for adc, Deft, JKL, Zven, Hope, Betty? I dont watch much lck so cant say much for them
[2:06:46] stinnytv: Teddy outclassed everyone last year and looked amazing in spring, had shaky MSC but they limit tested every game
[2:06:53] sxlitvry: JackeyLove doesn't choke. He ints

[2:07:31] icant_kekw: Never forget jackeylove kogmaw tp KEKW
[2:07:36] goblinguy01: We all knoe JKL loves to play melee ADCs. It's his playstyle.
[2:07:37] sxlitvry: Limit testing is a meme excuse like sandbagging
[2:07:39] big_miss_steakk: what is better choke or ints!!!??
[2:07:39] superdinooo: JKL is not ints but fearless EZ
[2:07:41] stinnytv: @rangedlegit I don‚Äôt think zven can hold a candle to Jackey

[2:08:16] zsergioss: you cant know for sure kevin
[2:08:19] icant_kekw: @kevinwu97 toss a coin, that's your answer LUL
[2:08:20] stinnytv: T1 literally played Gragas support every game kekw
[2:08:23] RangedLegit: @stinnytv Legit I think Zven is probably no1 in world atm, makes no mistakes in teamfights, always hard wins lane, incredibly consistent
[2:08:25] Heartuary: Skt didn‚Äôt make it out of groups in msc cuz of shaker
[2:08:34] big_miss_steakk: @superdino96 it is good??

[2:08:49] stinnytv: @rangedlegit he‚Äôs playing in NA, the whole league is a joke
[2:08:53] kevinwu97: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw i wanna bet dmo game2

[2:10:39] xxbadwomanxx: icon is a cool guy
[2:10:47] RangedLegit: @TL_LOST_TO_SOLO_Q_KEKW Yeah but this C9 doesent look like last years TL, they look so so much better, rest of NA is still bad to be fair
[2:10:47] big_miss_steakk: @zqy23311 uzi now don't count

[2:11:26] Zqy23311: jiumeng this season is also pretty good
[2:11:30] Heartuary: @dylan9718 nah he‚Äôs benched
[2:11:33] Dream_Later: the production cast is trolling the casters
[2:11:35] RangedLegit: @stinnytv Ah I dont care about KD, its just the way him and vulcan play

[2:13:51] fidix: don't think a doinb imitator will do well against the top tier mids xD
[2:13:53] icant_kekw: @RangedLegit the fact that NA has shown mediocre results consistently means that it's hard to have faith in C9 to make a huge splash.
[2:13:53] xxbadwomanxx: Maybe because his tattoo hand
[2:13:55] Zqy23311: but u won't expect him to turn the situation over

[2:14:26] kepzzz: WHY NOT MORDE :(
[2:14:26] icant_kekw: @RangedLegit I speak as an NA fan too, but you gotta be realistic here. Having hope is fine, but don't use hope as evidence that c9 will be good internationally

[2:16:58] ChinoisGG: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw im not saying that this is good proof or reasoning but rax thinks c9 would be top 2-3 lpl. I disagree but that high of praise would make me believe theyd at least be decent in lpl
[2:16:58] rj_rock: GG
[2:16:58] 32kh02: top no f knew
[2:17:01] icant_kekw: @RangedLegit c9 have no competition. the last time c9 dominated was during s3 summer and s4 spring. When c9 made worlds during s3, they were taken down by fnatic despite being overhyped
[2:17:04] RangedLegit: @TL_LOST_TO_SOLO_Q_KEKW The thing you have to consider, is im not comparing C9 vs NA im looking at how they play and the mistakes they make, how they teamfight, their macro, and it looks very good
[2:17:06] g0vernor69: LULIZI
[2:17:07] wuuren: Hacker can play more champs , just stop. It has to be a coach / drafting issue..

[2:17:33] CheDG: @rj_rock 5 mins
[2:17:36] goblinguy01: If C9 gets FNC, RNG/FPX, and X. They have no chance to make it out.
[2:17:38] coracao_de_frango: flash 6 min
[2:17:41] sxlitvry: @8days2late no. But they have better teamfight initiation imo
[2:17:44] rj_rock: @chedg thanks
[2:17:46] RangedLegit: @TL_LOST_TO_SOLO_Q_KEKW The problem is your basing your analysis when im not, because I agree NA is shit
[2:17:46] broblo_op: @8days2late yesn't
[2:17:52] stinnytv: @rangedlegit it‚Äôs going to look cleaner when the teams are objectively worse in the region, DMO would be top 5 NA
[2:17:54] jangho8656: Yuumie LULU WutFace
[2:17:55] lzllyjjrbaswgjrwcn: After this game, we gonna know which team is the worst in LPL
[2:17:56] coracao_de_frango: sorry flash 5 min and tp 6 min
[2:17:58] icant_kekw: @RangedLegit Sure c9 look good and I agree with you they look like the cleanest team in NA by far. However, how clean c9 look isn't really the greatest indicator, because they have no competition
[2:18:02] RangedLegit: @TL_LOST_TO_SOLO_Q_KEKW was supposed to say basing it on results
[2:18:12] brun0erikk: baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao
[2:18:13] g0vernor69: Aphelios LUL U EZ win KEKW

[2:18:30] GeNeSy91: @ohlinsakarapovic KDA is a good thing, but i prefer to watch the player positioning and macro game
[2:18:34] superdinooo: LPL is better teamfight experience , cuz they have to keep fight vs 16 teams Pog
[2:18:35] RangedLegit: @stinnytv Yes i agree DMO would be top 5 NA, but I dont think they would win a single game vs C9
[2:18:42] ever777: otto!
[2:18:52] 8days2late: @nepaliveigar @sxlitvry @quote_if_tfblade_crying Ah okay thanks. I am watching the LEC but actually i think maybe are the chinese better then most of the European players. But i just gonna watch :D thanks
[2:18:52] sxlitvry: If you watched C9 vs 100T, 100T's sup just gifted them the game
[2:18:56] VladS31: Pog
[2:19:02] hurleyguy82: DMO would be bottom 5 in NA LUL
[2:19:03] ChinoisGG: @tl_lost_to_solo_q_kekw also most top teams in lpl lck have expressed high interest in c9 which leads me to believe they are at least decent as players can guage when a team is good vs just shitting on bad competition
