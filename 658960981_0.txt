[3:59:44] blackobelisk1337: Top 2 teams in NA are extremely strong and are on a different caliber compared to LCK. This version of TSM is slightly better than the version of 2016 TSM and C9/EG/TL are stomping this. LCS this year isn't something to joke about. I think NA is closer to LPL level than LCK/EU.

[4:13:48] aland3rsonwr: Top 2 teams in BR are extremely strong and are on a different caliber compared to LCK. This version of PainGaming is slightly better than the version of 2016 PainGaming and KBM/KEYD/INTZ are stomping this. CBLOL this year isn't something to joke about. I think BR is closer to LPL level than LCK/EU.

[4:13:52] テイン495: Yeah, I'll say it. This year LCS is stronger than its ever been. C9 is a beast, and TL and TSM are returning to the forms that made them champions. Add EG and FLY continuing to improve and you've got one of the deepest regions in the world. Laugh while you can, NA is coming for you
