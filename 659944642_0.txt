[0:39:25] LmaoLp: 705 and Cryin rotting in contract jail btw
[0:39:39] FriedBaozi: @LmaoLp 705 only signed for 6 months
[0:39:50] FriedBaozi: but I agree cryin's talent is being wasted
[0:40:05] LmaoLp: thankfully for 705.
[0:40:21] FriedBaozi: if he stayed on estar they could really flourish next year with much better team chemistry
[0:40:32] LmaoLp: still a season where it looks like he's not getting playtime unless new shits the bed entirely
[0:41:11] LmaoLp: wasn't cryins choice, im guessing you're probably aware but saying in case you arent :)
[0:41:15] FriedBaozi: well at least 705 is really young and he might learn a bit on RNG for now
[0:41:29] FriedBaozi: yeah rumour has it RNG has some buy back clause
[0:41:45] LmaoLp: yeah, they had it in his contract
[0:42:20] FriedBaozi: although I also read some rumour that cryin is "negative gaming" in his ranked practise
[0:42:24] LmaoLp: can tell pdd didn't expect them to exercise that given what he ended up with
[0:42:38] HystericsCasts: I'd be toxic too if I was sitting on the bench
[0:42:39] LmaoLp: might be trying to get dropped OMEGALUL
[0:42:59] FriedBaozi: i mean it's possible the buyback isn't an option
[0:43:15] FriedBaozi: it's also rumoured cryin is lent to ES for free

[0:43:44] FriedBaozi: most of his KG is in his big brain
[0:44:09] LmaoLp: part of the reason they got cryin was the trade for xlb

[0:45:34] FriedBaozi: hopefully RNG can play cryin soon maybe play heavy top side
[0:45:47] LmaoLp: rng basically traded wink and a bunch of cash for xlb, pdd spent it back on cjj xiaobai cryin, from what i piece together. but he got cryin on this contract and didnt expect rng to pull him back which basically nuked estar's summer hopes
[0:46:36] FriedBaozi: from what i've read cryin was used to trade for flandre and the trade almost went through
[0:46:52] LmaoLp: pdd has pretty much said on his weibo don't expect them to do much of anything in summer, i was told the wording was super pissed off
[0:47:01] FriedBaozi: although I think flandre didn't want to leave and had some issues with the management
