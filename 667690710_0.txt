[1:23:29] ye1l: GP soooo free why they refuse to play it
[1:23:41] HystericsCasts: We talk to Chinese casters in the makeup room - usually our production team picks their own replays and works seperately in that regard to the chinese broadcast

[1:26:09] PrayWMe: Rice Poggies
[1:26:12] ye1l: @rangedlegit virtually all gp matchups are jungle dependent because he is really safe in lane with barrels and W, he isn't really bad into any single champion that traditionally goes toplane

[1:26:30] sxk666666: volibear t1 top
[1:26:33] HystericsCasts: @najafan usually just a chat about standout players, never really in-depth narrative. Teddy and Remember are really good to chat to though about player stories at times
[1:26:40] generalmao: Chocolate or candy ???!?!
[1:26:43] hermeneutist: cn: croc vs bear is going to be extremely violent; once anyone starts trading they will have to commit till someone dies

[1:26:55] RangedLegit: @ye1l I agree, its not that bad of a matchup, and can easily swing in GP's favour, im just saying why they probably didnt pick it
[1:27:01] Optyfenx: @ye1l gp gets picked but not blind and many prefer other options vs the usual blind picks

[1:27:44] generalmao: Ap Yi was the best hands down
[1:27:55] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @hystericscasts what's the biggest LPL stream out of these 3? you know?
[1:27:56] Vinimaxii: !english

[1:28:10] Beeejj: Who wins
[1:28:11] hermeneutist: quite interesting that RW had side selection and picked red side
[1:28:12] ye1l: also, GP shuts down Aphelios super hard too, makes it very difficult for him to use any short-range gun without dying.

[1:28:25] najafan: Yeah, I've noticed some of the West fan narratives vs East fan narratives are really different on things. Though, sometimes it's cross region, so what Chinese fans think of Korean players vs what NA fans think, etc etc.
[1:28:28] ultranovel: god chat is very good today

[1:28:43] HystericsCasts: like for example the Chinese fans are not as pumped on ppgod as the west
[1:28:47] billtownlegend: is anyone doing an english cast, opalcasts normally do but it's offline
[1:28:49] icant_kekw: 2-1 JDG with JDG's current form imo
[1:28:51] hermeneutist: JDG seems to be returning to form, with kanavi getting back into rhythm
[1:28:52] admerau: @HiImAdil JDG 100¬®%
