[0:45:29] 지우01: Not today @mkimmey
[0:45:29] lolbreadwinnermama: basically every T1 member who went to VG didn't do well
[0:45:36] pennysok: what r u talking about man rookie steps up every single game
[0:45:47] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Theshy can die like 10 thousand times and he would still have top 2 damage count in the game
[0:45:48] lionkk98: 999999999999999
[0:45:50] blushonechan: is there gonna be worlds?

[0:46:31] TRv5T: sell baolan
[0:46:39] 지우01: Imagine IG with jackeylove PogChamp
[0:46:47] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Puff and Ning are the 2 main shotcallers of IG now
[0:47:15] pennysok: I can imagine IG with jackeylove because they already won world championship LUL
[0:47:26] 지우01: IG no draft coach
[0:47:40] TATboy: BGM NAME PLZ.
[0:48:02] vikiwei: no way
[0:48:09] G2_FLUKE_MSl: LPL song better than LCK gameplay FeelsOkayMan
[0:48:13] h011ywood: they had jackeylove last year, they struggled
[0:48:29] lolbreadwinnermama: song name is?
[0:48:30] pennysok: because ning was so shitty last year
[0:48:31] Jesus_ls_Here: boring games today T.T
[0:48:41] pennysok: this year ning is much better
[0:48:47] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @JesuslsHere TES gonna be shitting on some kids today FeelsOkayMan
[0:48:55] 지우01: See you when EDG play
[0:49:00] Jesus_ls_Here: but theshy is instead underperforming now :))
[0:49:05] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Ning looks incredible now
[0:49:14] Jesus_ls_Here: @G2_FLUKE_MSl yeah stomps kinda suck
[0:49:19] WJ20110720: jackeylove didn't want to leave IG, but his cousin messed up his contract
[0:49:33] h011ywood: every team will ban TheShy's kalista and gank him hard
[0:49:43] Jesus_ls_Here: how is his cousin involved?
[0:50:09] pennysok: the shy is a bait for ig
[0:50:12] WJ20110720: His cousin is his agent
[0:50:13] h011ywood: wasn't jackeylove asking for too much
[0:50:29] pennysok: rookie is the real carry on this team
[0:50:30] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Peak ning was the reason IG became great. Everytime IG peaks it's cause Ning is peaking
[0:50:34] jesussellscrack: JKL was just a third wheel LUL
[0:50:34] h011ywood: jackeylove is good but not a game changer like rookie or theshy
[0:50:35] WeemGG: que pasa con los chinitos
[0:50:35] zhenyuea: Rookie
[0:50:45] WeemGG: que pasa po a ver que pasa
[0:50:46] Jesus_ls_Here: i mean it's like gimgoon but he ints hard, he soaks pressure but he also dies a lot
[0:51:23] dontpkplz: Maple x Karsa BibleThump
[0:51:34] jesussellscrack: just go next to vg vs es

[0:52:13] ElMenGod: no PPgod tonight? Sadge
[0:52:17] h011ywood: theshy does tons of damage
[0:52:18] pennysok: inconsistent
[0:52:38] jesussellscrack: theshy isnt that good anymore, whereas rookie still hard carrying his team
[0:52:40] zhenyuea: Of course
[0:52:45] 32kh02: congratulations
[0:52:49] pennysok: but his damage is dealt on lane phase
[0:52:53] ElMenGod: TES is op tbh

[0:53:09] G2_FLUKE_MSl: JACKEYLOVE FeelsOkayMan
[0:53:12] pennysok: which is pretty much useless if you dealt 2 times more damage than enemy tank top laner
[0:53:21] h011ywood: like the game when he was playing rumble last week...he inted but look at the end of game damage, he did the most damage of everyone
[0:53:21] jesussellscrack: the fact that TES didn't even play that well last game and still won is scary
[0:53:26] pennysok: and U int several times
[0:53:29] fazed343: SourPls
[0:53:53] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @jesussellscrack TES looks IG-like when they're not stomping hard
[0:54:12] kingyv2: 1.7k people watching a countdown lmao
[0:54:33] fazed343: @G2_FLUKE_MSl like current IG or peak IG?
[0:54:37] pennysok: Ig crumbles when they play agianst tier 1 teams
[0:54:39] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @kingy_sans We're here to wait for the 2020 World Champions FeelsOkayMan
[0:54:49] jesussellscrack: @G2_FLUKE_MSl maybe they don't want to go too ham to make the game more exciting
[0:55:06] tgunicornn: under 24.5 for me
[0:55:07] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @fazed343 Peak ig. Every time the game is even they keep forcing teamfights and winning 2v5s out of nowhere
[0:55:30] WJ20110720: 10.12 meta is not suitable for theshy
[0:55:32] pennysok: TES, JDG, LGD and FPX will crush IG tbh... Although I love IG
[0:55:55] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @pennysok IG just beat FPX 2-1 a few days ago
[0:56:08] fazed343: @G2_FLUKE_MSl Nice so your saying Peak TES > Peak IG
[0:56:09] 호에에에에에에에에에엥: TES! TES! TES!

[0:56:26] zhenyuea: Yes, ig is still very powerful
[0:56:30] lolbreadwinnermama: PEAK IG is almost gone
[0:56:32] pennysok: Okay but dont forget what they performed in Bo5 series
[0:56:38] fazed343: SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[0:56:43] jesussellscrack: IG's weakness is their adc role
[0:57:01] pennysok: nah puff is not a bad player
[0:57:07] dl_na_uzi_lul: LPL changed playlist?
[0:57:13] pennysok: he is just not that Alpha like jackeylove
[0:57:14] WJ20110720: And their JG
[0:57:17] TRv5T: puff is not even..wtf u smokin bruh
[0:57:25] Oldmrbrightside: This song is terrible.. give me keepsake

[0:58:07] Firixia: I agree with that I feel IG lives and dies by Ning
[0:58:09] Oldmrbrightside: No don’t say that, I need my dose of Lyriks roasting the others
[0:58:10] icant_kekw: LUL
[0:58:10] jesussellscrack: rookie is IG's most consistent player
