[2:52:48] dl_na_uzi_lul: @g2_fluke_msl don’t bother arguing with a western LCK fanboy. They worship old “best league” which is LCK to hide the fact that they themselves come from trash regions and have no clues about the game whatsoever and could not switch to LPL in time to pretend not to be just a bandwagoner. The best example is the famous “coach” and “analyst” just by living in Korea named LS LUL

[2:53:52] xdeylmaokek: Yeah, I’ll say it. This year NA LCS is stronger than its ever been. Cloud 9 is a beast, and TSM is returning to the forms that made them champions. Add Evil Geniuses and Team Liquid continuing to improve and you’ve got one of the deepest regions in the world. Laugh while you can, NA is coming for you. NA would be top 1 in LEC, LCK LPL and top 3 in CBLOL
