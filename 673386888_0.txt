[0:20:40] ElliotLake: I want a PPGOD worlds skin
[0:20:55] Jesus_ls_Here: well I mean, this year, two teams will make it out of the qualifiers
[0:21:31] Jesus_ls_Here: so they do have a good chance as long as they make it to semis, but the problem is that they finished last in first split so they don't have a lot of points
[0:21:45] KingMangaMan: Yeah
[0:22:02] ElliotLake: They should get all the bonus points for having PPGOD
[0:22:29] KingMangaMan: They have to go REALLY deep in the qualifiers in summer to get there
[0:22:30] Jesus_ls_Here: they need to play well in playoffs tbh
[0:23:27] arturEtzka: Corby, i miss you on Flamengo BibleThump

[0:35:26] shemony: addiction is real. there are worse things to be addicted to in this world my friend
[0:36:00] sundownser: sure :D
[0:36:24] wimpodwarden: Like crack
[0:37:19] sundownser: or buying knives
[0:38:19] shemony: i see u in the chat sometimes u must know i win alot on lpl i hardly ever lose and when i do i immediately make another wager and atleast break even u shouldnt wish evil on anyone especially since you obviously dont know me but it's ok im sure u were kidding
[0:38:35] wimpodwarden: kdub1 kdub2
[0:38:41] sundownser: yea i am kidding im glad thats obvious haha

[0:42:11] kenguin35: PPGOD HYPE
[0:42:31] BadTime: does anyone in the chat care and learn from the comments of these guys? sincere question
[0:42:50] sundownser: no honestly I wish they just showed a black screen between games
[0:43:03] sundownser: not joking
[0:43:13] yigeiwoligiaog: LNG WutFace
[0:43:24] kenguin35: personally I enjoy the banter
[0:43:29] shemony: of course not its twitch most comments are for lulz and trolling obv
[0:43:45] Jesus_ls_Here: of course, it's always fun having their insight on games, I'm not a massive analyst so most of the time i don't know what to make of some teams and they help with that
[0:44:06] sundownser: mormon :O
[0:44:39] KingMangaMan: The guy on the right (don't know his name) has pretty insightful commentary during games. Although he's a bit rude sometimes.
[0:44:57] shemony: who? im a jew. but i love everyone except cops
[0:45:01] sundownser: thers an unfortunately varying degrees of accuracy with the casters sometimes, some cant really be trusted
[0:45:14] kenguin35: if it looks like renekton
[0:45:29] Jesus_ls_Here: @KingMangaMan he used to be in an emo band so cut him some slack
[0:45:49] KingMangaMan: Holy shit really? Are there pictures?
[0:46:06] KingMangaMan: That sounds hilarious
[0:46:20] yigeiwoligiaog: WutFace
[0:46:30] Jesus_ls_Here: Design The Skyline, he used to do keyboards, just careful, that crap is awful
[0:46:37] shemony: im sure these casters bet every game and probably win alot
[0:46:59] sundownser: projection
[0:47:03] Steezebeanz: is flandre playing today?
[0:47:10] Jesus_ls_Here: they work for tencent, i doubt they need money from bets tbh
[0:47:19] KingMangaMan: Yeah I wasn't gonna listen to the music, I just wanna see what he looked like in an emo band.
[0:48:05] shemony: obv v5 and ig are heavy favs im feeling v5 but idk ig could be a ez upset
[0:48:08] Jesus_ls_Here: aurelion sol LUL
[0:48:31] Jesus_ls_Here: If i did bet, i'd never bet on IG games, they're too coinflip
[0:48:54] ElliotLake: pepeD PPGOD HYPE pepeD
[0:49:02] Jesus_ls_Here: PPGOD Pog
[0:49:19] vikiwei: V5???
[0:49:25] tovo__: whens the next game??
[0:49:47] Jesus_ls_Here: game starts in 31 minutes
[0:49:54] tovo__: ok ty
[0:50:05] tovo__: oh
[0:50:11] vikiwei: nobody likes V5?
[0:50:21] tovo__: tjeres a timer lol
[0:50:24] Jesus_ls_Here: V5 will win worlds wdym
[0:50:46] Jesus_ls_Here: yeah top right corner @tivo7
[0:50:48] KingMangaMan: V5 is the true 0 to Hero story. I can't wait for them to make a playoff run
[0:50:52] BunnyFakkuu: does this game matter
[0:51:02] BunnyFakkuu: for v5?
[0:51:03] cicero227: LUL
[0:51:14] BunnyFakkuu: or is the standings locked
[0:51:29] vikiwei: just for V5
[0:51:35] Jesus_ls_Here: depends on your definition for "matter" V5 need to finish as high as they can because they need championship points so yes it matters a lot
[0:51:51] Moobot: Calm the spam, @leozimofizz (warning)
[0:51:51] BunnyFakkuu: 2-0 v5 then?
[0:51:52] KingMangaMan: All games for V5 are pretty important if they want to make it to worlds. Their spring split was shit so they need to place as high as possible in summer
[0:53:15] Jesus_ls_Here: it's a bit sad that if we're sending V5 that means either JDG FPX or IG won't be going to worlds and tbh that's kinda unfortunate
[0:53:15] ffrog: caps for sure
[0:53:26] shemony: f it im gonna gamble.. post my bet in a few mins when my i finish depositing
[0:53:32] Jesus_ls_Here: assuming TOP wins lpl ofc
[0:53:37] hagekanai: 1
[0:53:39] nhloc: PPGOD in worlds imagine
[0:53:43] KingMangaMan: Yeah, I'm just glad we get 4 Chinese teams in worlds this year
[0:53:48] Jesus_ls_Here: @shemony good luck mate
[0:54:14] KingMangaMan: @shemony Trust in the PPGod
[0:54:25] Doktor_Wyvern: there is gonna be 4 chinese teams in worlds?
[0:54:31] KingMangaMan: Yeah
[0:54:41] Jesus_ls_Here: @KingMangaMan 4 LPL teams 4 LEC teams, that's such a garbage horrible trade for the LEC LMAO
[0:54:52] puff400: PPGOD
[0:55:11] Doktor_Wyvern: PPGod will win worlds, I'm locking in my bet now.
[0:55:21] Jesus_ls_Here: LEC would be fine with sending 2 teams if the LPL sends 2 teams as well, less chances of getting 3-0ed
[0:55:38] KingMangaMan: They made a rules change since COVID-19 made MSI impossible. So they're extending worlds a little bit to make up for it partially. Thus they gave the LPL and the LEC 4 team spots since they've been doing the best the last few years internationally.
[0:56:13] Jesus_ls_Here: hopefully that becomes a tradition
[0:56:22] KingMangaMan: God I hope so
[0:56:43] h011ywood: every region that wins the last two worlds should get extra worlds slots aka 2 extra for lpl
[0:56:48] KingMangaMan: The LPL has too much talent that they have to leave at home some years.
[0:56:50] Doktor_Wyvern: man, can't wait to watch an overhyped LEC team get 3-0d yet again LUL
[0:57:22] Jesus_ls_Here: LEC just wet the bed vs LPL all the time it's hilarious
[0:57:25] h011ywood: LCS should only get 1 slot
[0:57:37] shemony: ty bros! y'all gonna think im crazy but when ur feeling it your feeling it. literally watched every lpl game for the past 4 months so going for thw +365
[0:57:49] Jesus_ls_Here: i'm excited for C9 tbh
[0:58:12] KingMangaMan: Dude the LEC might not make it very far this year based on how they're playing recently.
[0:58:15] Doktor_Wyvern: @shemony gl I believe in you
[0:58:32] h011ywood: im only rooting for mad lions in the LEC
[0:58:35] Jesus_ls_Here: @shemony you do you mate, just make sure you don't bet everything u have just in case, good luck
[0:58:46] najafan: I mean, G2 can probably get it together
[0:58:49] shemony: Placed 07/08/2020 @ 01:38 AM Risk: $49.93 - Win: $230.72 Invictus Gaming vrs Bilibili Gaming - Bilibili Gaming +365 - (Invictus Gaming vrs Bilibili Gaming) Game Start 07/08/2020 @ 04:00 AM Victory Five vrs LNG Esports - Victory Five -479 - (Victory Five vrs LNG Esports) Game Start 07/08/2020 @ 02:00 AM Ticket # 451520679
[0:59:19] najafan: FNC looks bad. But Perkz is going through some personal stuff for G2.
[0:59:27] KingMangaMan: True,
[0:59:30] najafan: MAD looks solid.
[0:59:30] Jesus_ls_Here: @cicero227 ?? is that why they never won anything?
[0:59:48] KingMangaMan: I hope they at least make to to worlds, even if they don't win in summer
[1:00:09] cicero227: @JesuslsHere U're telling me in 2019 fpx is a better team than G2??? where was fpx in msi nowhere cuz fpx is not good
[1:00:15] Jesus_ls_Here: @KingMangaMan normally when G2 starts losing i don't count them out cos they just having fun, but this split, they genuinely look BAD, like it's not even trolling it's just a dip in performance
[1:00:27] KingMangaMan: I can't enjoy watching them get smashed by the LPL if they don't even make it.
[1:00:41] najafan: FPX is a fine team, they just happened to luck into the perfect meta for them in 2019 worlds
[1:00:45] cicero227: @JesuslsHere fnatic 2020 "overperformed" but really they performed at their normal level. If they overperform they win worlds 2020
[1:00:56] cicero227: shit i mean 2019 fnatic
[1:01:11] Doktor_Wyvern: @cicero227 overperformed so hard they got 0-3d LUL
[1:01:13] Jesus_ls_Here: @cicero227 i'm not having that conversation mate, the world champions are clear, believe whatever u want to believe. see you in worlds later this year
[1:01:36] cicero227: @JesuslsHere It's not belief "jesus" it's facts
[1:01:37] najafan: Results based analysis?
[1:01:48] najafan: In MY twitch chat?
[1:01:58] najafan: It's more likely than you think.
[1:02:05] h011ywood: IG should get rid of the extra supports and get a backup ADC and Jungler
[1:02:22] Jesus_ls_Here: the facts are that LPL 3-0ed LEC two years straight in worlds :)
[1:02:47] kenguin35: V5>TES lol
[1:02:48] KingMangaMan: PPGod will lead V5 into victory against TOP
[1:02:49] najafan: Results based analysis = peak normie
[1:02:52] cicero227: @JesuslsHere facts is the finalists are the better team two years in a row fnatic n g2
[1:02:53] Doktor_Wyvern: 9 years since the last EU worlds win LUL
[1:03:14] lazyfatdork69: where can i hear the podcast they make ?
[1:03:15] sma55ive: just ban lucian :)
[1:03:34] najafan: PPSquad
[1:03:36] cicero227: fnatic rekt ig in groups lol
[1:03:54] Doktor_Wyvern: @cicero227 and still lost LUL
[1:03:57] cicero227: winning dont make u better team overall jesus
[1:04:13] najafan: So I'm not saying anything about 2018. But in 2019 FPX absolutely fell into the perfect meta for themselves in worlds.
[1:04:19] Doktor_Wyvern: @cicero227 yeah, that's why Schalke is the best team KEKW
[1:04:29] najafan: G2 was OVERALL the better team. But in THAT SPECIFIC META FPX was the better team.
[1:04:48] sma55ive: EU cope LUL
[1:04:56] cicero227: @najafan wtf u r say.....
[1:05:11] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan 9 years since the last LEC favored meta eh?
[1:05:24] cicero227: @Ezuumi No, that's not how it works. If fpx better team where they in msi??? nowhere
[1:05:31] KingMangaMan: I mean I don't necessarily agree with that @najafan. FPX was stomping all summer, and it's not like the other teams didn't have months to adapt to the meta.
[1:05:48] icant_kekw: PP DIFF PPGiggle
[1:06:01] 罗小喵: ....
[1:06:04] najafan: I'm not an LEC fan, so idk why you're trying to meme me about EU not winning since S1
[1:06:04] Doktor_Wyvern: ^that's how competitive sports work
[1:06:08] cicero227: @Ezuumi That's just wrong
[1:06:23] najafan: @Ezuumi results based analysis is bad analysis
[1:06:23] KingMangaMan: If they can't get it together throughout ALL of summer and the entire Worlds tournament, they're clearly worse in significant ways.
[1:06:36] yuroummmm: LUL
[1:06:51] icant_kekw: The better team is the team that wins 5Head
[1:06:52] yigeiwoligiaog: PPGOD PogChamp
[1:07:01] cicero227: @Ezuumi Dont type then what?
[1:07:07] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan you're not offering an alternative analysis though, why is G2 the better team?
[1:07:14] sma55ive: The better team gets 3-0ed 5Head it just wasnt their meta 5Head
[1:07:22] cicero227: @Ezuumi whether we take you seriously or not is something we decide on.
[1:07:25] 罗小喵: Who do you think is the strongest lpl
[1:07:35] yuroummmm: 777777
[1:07:51] najafan: @KingMangaMan except G2 was stomping all year, so that's a bad argument. There were specific patches that made FPX's style better for worlds in particular, and that style held up into S10 as well (though it's beginning to fall off). FPX's style would not be effective in S7, for example
[1:07:55] jovicstern: Pao
[1:08:02] icant_kekw: G2 is better at losing in finals KEKW
[1:08:07] yigeiwoligiaog: BLG ResidentSleeper
[1:08:20] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan stomping who? the LEC? C9 is stomping pretty well to LUL
[1:08:30] Jesus_ls_Here: i just got timed out from chat cos i mentioned a dude with a Chinese name lmfaooo
[1:08:49] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @JesuslsHere Moobot blocks all foreign languages
[1:08:56] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan also, you said results based analysis was bad.
[1:08:56] cicero227: Why you think they pick Pyke vs fpx??? It's cuz they must have stomp fpx in scrims with it. FPX is not a better team than g2 and that still applies to today. On my grave.
[1:08:58] FizzStayNight: just kick fofo
[1:09:08] cornelius360: baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao baianPao
[1:09:13] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @Ezuumi Foreign alphabets LUL
[1:09:16] icant_kekw: FPX won more scrims vs G2 tho...
[1:09:18] nessunafantasia: PPGOD WAITING ROOM
[1:09:22] najafan: @Doktor_Wyvern someone else made the point that FPX was stomping. Responding in kind points out how bad the argument is.
[1:09:29] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @cicero227 FPX was stomping G2 in scrims LUL
[1:09:44] triganaros: @cicero227 remind me who won worlds finals? g2 or fpx`?
[1:09:44] yigeiwoligiaog: G2 fansboy WutFace
[1:09:47] sma55ive: Bruh you should be thinking about if G2 can take a game off any of the teams lpl sends this year
[1:10:01] najafan: I'm DECIDEDLY not a G2 fanboy.
[1:10:02] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @cicero227 DWG, SKT, and FPX were all confirmed to have stomped G2 in scrims
[1:10:02] 罗小喵: : i just got timed out from chat cos i mentioned a dude with a Chinese name lmfaooo
[1:10:03] cicero227: @G2_FLUKE_MSl Ok g2 racist.
[1:10:11] najafan: I'm an LCK fanboy.
[1:10:12] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @cicero227 G2 racist LULW
[1:10:16] icant_kekw: G2 is a race KEKW
[1:10:26] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @najafan I need to wash my eyes after watching that game KEKW
[1:10:26] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan mb didn't spot that. still waiting on your reasoning though.
[1:10:30] sundownser: i wish that my food would arrive
[1:10:30] yigeiwoligiaog: LCK FANBOY LUL
[1:10:38] IguinRP: we miss u in Flamengo!! Jordan Corby
[1:10:50] Jesus_ls_Here: i've been a fan of the LPL for SO LONG and it always felt bad when people were celebrating their teams and i couldn't cos LPL wet the bed internationally but man I don't ever remember coming up with fictional facts such as "Better team was the one that got 3-0ed"
[1:11:04] Doktor_Wyvern: ^
[1:11:05] cicero227: Guys chill. We need to chilll. All I'm saying is G2 and FNATIC are the better teams on each world finals. Aight? We chill
[1:11:11] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @JesuslsHere I think he was trolling LUL
[1:11:21] KingMangaMan: @najafan What I'm trying to say is that adapting to the meta is clearly a significant feature of a team. G2 had their meta going into tournament, they had their idea of how they wanted to play the game. FPX had their own ideas as well. And it clearly turned out that PFX had a better idea regarding the current meta since they 3-0ed G2.
[1:11:36] Doktor_Wyvern: @cicero227 no, because that's stupid. winners don't get 3-0d
[1:11:38] luciferinsane: w
[1:11:41] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @KingMangaMan FPX was just clearly better
[1:11:42] sundownser: fnatic lost to schalke
[1:11:51] MrTunaF1sh: caps
[1:12:01] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Blaber and Shadow only
[1:12:04] najafan: @Doktor_Wyvern stronger overall on most playstyles. Chinese teams tend to hyperfocus on one playstyle, whereas G2 is a generalist team that forces others out of their comfort zone and into improv situations where they take over with generally superior game sense.
[1:12:08] skot_lol: shad0w
[1:12:16] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Perkz not likely to build synergy quick at all
[1:12:35] G2_FLUKE_MSl: Plus Perkz is not all that good mechanically compared to top LPL players
[1:12:42] najafan: @KingMangaMan this misunderstands G2 as a team, G2 does not play to a specific meta. G2 is a jazz pianist, not a classical pianist.
[1:12:43] Jesus_ls_Here: i mean if it was a series like the KT IG quarter finals, i would understand someone saying KT is better because that series was too close and it could've went both ways but 3-0 is just too much
[1:13:25] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @JesuslsHere G2 got stomped in scrims vs FPX too. Tian said on stream that they were stomping the shit out of them and that they knew G2 very well
[1:13:28] icant_kekw: IG was 1 nexus from a 3-0 FeelsBadMan
[1:13:40] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan G2 games always devolve into clown fiestas in the LEC, which is what we see from the bottom LPL teams.
[1:14:00] najafan: It just so happens that FPX got exactly the right style of music for them to play to however, so no matter how good G2 is at improv, FPX is better because they're hyperfocused on this style.
[1:14:09] cicero227: If you want to go that route too. G2 on EACH individual ROLE are leagues ahead of each players on FPX. FPX literally have ROLEPLAYERS on their roster. G2 LITERALLY have the best performing players on each damn role. G2 >FPX and it's by a long shot
[1:14:23] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @cicero227 C9 would be #1 in EU
[1:14:24] 罗小喵: I think the bo5 of ig and kt is the most wonderful
[1:14:25] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan so, G2 is better because FPX can actually execute a strategy?
[1:14:25] D4rs1nk: @Doktor_Wyvern lol every lpl game is a clown fiesta KEKW
[1:14:28] sundownser: no. no. stop
[1:14:38] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @D4rs1nk Did you see DRX last game KEKW
[1:14:41] Shuntianfu: LEC delusional fanboys here LUL
[1:14:43] Doktor_Wyvern: @D4rs1nk this is true, and this is why LPL is so entertaining
[1:14:55] yuroummmm: LPL＞LCK LUL
[1:15:15] Jesus_ls_Here: KT IG was an actually intense series, i remember being nervous entire game, was fun, real fun
[1:15:17] najafan: @Doktor_Wyvern no, G2 is better overall because in most metas G2 would win, because the strategy FPX would attempt to force would be ineffective.
[1:15:28] cymbiline: I kinda didn’t like the lpl casters in the beginning but they grew on me
[1:15:29] cicero227: @G2_FLUKE_MSl I mean that works for x any team literally
[1:15:29] conceitedmodesty: OPL>LPL
[1:15:34] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @najafan They were stomping the shit out of every LPL team the entire year
[1:15:38] kenguin35: LMAO COME BACK WHEN YOU WIN WORLDS LEC
[1:15:46] Jesus_ls_Here: @cymbiline IKR SAME!!
[1:16:05] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan I don't understand. Use some examples. Because worlds looked like G2 forcing fights and FPX winning them.
[1:16:10] najafan: I responded to this argument above.
[1:16:10] bolyvfr: No. LCK 31.6K VS LPL 2.2K that does show the strength of regions.
[1:16:17] MaldLions: Let’s go V5’
[1:16:18] Shuntianfu: G2 > LPL, only got stomped 0/3 twice btw 4Head
[1:16:22] cicero227: @kenguin35 Sure, wait a few months and I belive G2 will laugh at all the proud asian teams.
[1:16:35] D4rs1nk: @najafan G2 is good but the reason they lost the finals is because they really played bad, not because fpx is as godly as 2018 IG (imo please no flame) :)
[1:16:36] racokky1: uwu rw vs dmo
[1:16:53] G2_FLUKE_MSl: @Doktor_Wyvern They were just outclassed. FPX shat on LPL on both Spring and Summer. If FPX peaked at worlds then they were peaking the entirety of 2019
[1:16:56] ElliotLake: pepeD PPGOD HYPE pepeD
[1:16:57] Jesus_ls_Here: views don't mean skill man wth, LCK is more popular cos you got LS and his goonsquad and faker on top so people will be more interested in it
[1:16:57] Gabiru972: ResidentSleeper
[1:16:58] najafan: @Doktor_Wyvern I'm sorry, this completely misunderstands my argument. To give examples from worlds would be to use the meta that FPX is better in, which I CEDE is the case.
[1:17:00] cicero227: @D4rs1nk Exactly man.

[1:20:06] najafan: This can be taking fights.
[1:20:13] ultranovel: SUBS Pog
[1:20:14] D4rs1nk: TSM wins Worlds 2020 for sure!!
[1:20:25] Doktor_Wyvern: @najafan right, and when they tried to force fights they got bodied. then forced more. then forced more.
[1:20:27] najafan: This NOT WORKING, just shows it doesn't work when the meta is well understood by the opponent.
[1:20:33] bigruntz: why do they have days they don't have English casting

I'm sure by now they've learned from their mistakes and will be better prepared

[2:16:50] Shuntianfu: @najafan Then your Korea regions needs to reform. Even if it's a cultural thing it's part of the game. In Exports, RESULTS speak. you can look for 100 excuses but if you lost you lost LUL
[2:16:56] conceitedmodesty: @g2_fluked_msi I think the shift came from the fact that they saw that they could actually compete so they got motivated and work harder

[2:17:09] najafan: @Shuntianfu of course it needs reform! I agree!

[2:18:55] najafan: @G2_FLUKED_MSI It probably will, it just will take something big. The LCK players were hoping for a G2 win last worlds for the reform to start, actually.
[2:18:58] goblinguy01: Not progressing is a bad sign for any region
[2:19:01] look_pagoda: yeah LCK is boring af too
[2:19:01] G2_FLUKED_MSI: @johnson1209777 Also LCK benefits hugely from LPL players playing in Korean server. Almost half of the pros in KR challenger are LPL players
