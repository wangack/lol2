[0:49:14] diddlybop: what are some of the best series so far this split you guys think? fpx vs tes and v5 vs tes were both really good

[0:51:35] diddlybop: and ESPN rankings are nothing more than what will generate the most page views
[0:51:36] Jesus_ls_Here: ranking C9 top5 is too generous, but then again it's ESPN lmao basically a joke

[0:54:34] diddlybop: LPL is gonna run over teams at worlds again tho
[0:54:38] barthomartinelly: my personal League rankings: cblol 1) LPL 2) LCK 3) LEC 4) OPL 5) LCS

[0:55:21] ElliotLake: WHERE WERE YOU WHEN PPGOD WONNERED
[0:55:25] matt_3238: On paper C9 could maybe make semis?
[0:55:33] EverRiley: chat, what does LPL mean?
[0:55:37] diddlybop: gonna depend way too much on the group tbh
[0:55:47] diddlybop: c9 has no chance if they get a shit draw
[0:55:49] FrenchTomahawk: League Player Leage @EverRiley
[0:55:50] Jesus_ls_Here: @ElliotLake was here, celebrating with my fellow pp brothers
[0:55:59] fazed343: @matt_3238 ya its possible if they get a good match up
[0:56:01] StannyBoyTM: The inly reason LCS never made it to the finals is that americans always stay in groups
[0:56:09] ElliotLake: pepeD PPGOD pepeD
[0:56:14] fazed343: @EverRiley Lol Pro League
[0:56:18] matt_3238: Chat lets be real. T1 trash
[0:56:24] i1m2tv: nah LEC is probably the second internationally LCK is too slow and can't compete on LEC level and LCS are still weak
[0:56:25] DimSilhouette: What if PPGOD isn't a real god.....
[0:56:33] SixPackWeeb: @matt_3238 and your life doesnt matter
[0:56:51] Jesus_ls_Here: @DimSilhouette you watch your f****** mouth
[0:57:01] DimSilhouette: @JesuslsHere BibleThump
[0:57:02] diddlybop: drx with kiin could be huge
[0:57:02] matt_3238: @GelsonFeigan T1 fanboy mad
[0:57:04] Naamverloren: When is worlds anyways?
[0:57:14] RangedLegit: Why would you put Khan into DRX? surely theres better toplaners
[0:57:20] SixPackWeeb: @matt_3238 Im fanboy from myself, sorry
[0:57:21] noem2k: Even if G2 gets 3-0'd again this years finals, still a huge achievement for EU ngl
[0:57:56] Jesus_ls_Here: @lilume_noem not at all, first year it was huge, second it was iffy, thrid year it's just EUW chokers
[0:58:09] matt_3238: Why would DRX get rid of Doran?
[0:58:23] fazed343: @matt_3238 as much as i want T1 to be trash theyre prolly gonna win finals by mind controlling the enemy team to be shit
[0:58:24] noem2k: nah it's huge, being second best region isn't choking at all
[0:58:25] diddlybop: i think if you put khan on drx they look worse, they already have 2 extremely talented carries
[0:58:57] i1m2tv: At least LEC have some competition this year but LPL looks very scary, going to be interesting worlds
[0:58:57] matt_3238: Doran doesn't seem that bad
[0:59:04] beet000: Maple PogChamp
[0:59:19] chia11: C9 will destroy TES
[0:59:24] diddlybop: kiin or summit on drx would make a world of difference i think
[0:59:39] Jesus_ls_Here: getting stomped in world finals 3 years in a row by the same region is the epitome of choking, also just because G2 is a finalist doesn't mean LEC is 2nd best region in the world, no one bootcamps in EU, everyone goes to KR and CN to Bootcamp cos they're the two best regions
[0:59:41] diddlybop: both of them play weak side really well
[0:59:47] chia11: Even C9 lose one game in LCS. NA is so good

[1:46:15] ye1l: @i1m2tv only way LCK can win is through botlanes and lucky dragon rolls. Teddy and Deft are definitely better than LPL ADCs, especially Teddy.
