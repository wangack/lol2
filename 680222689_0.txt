[1:07:22] NiceKevin: Don’t think omg that much better
[1:07:37] Optyfenx: @RangedLegit i hope, they didn't start rat over wink because he was better. thats the main thing i worry about wink has something with his eyes according to estar
[1:08:11] NiceKevin: Ha rat definitely not better than wink
[1:08:33] carryme40: i remember when jihn was op. now he is auto-loss. what up with that
[1:08:36] NiceKevin: But hoping he plays reckless and gets lucky
[1:08:52] RangedLegit: Idk man, have you seen how good rookies are this split? ADC is also a good role for a rookie unless Wink did alot of good shotcalling
[1:09:07] demize_991: who will win?
[1:09:27] carryme40: rat promoted, and if he does well, mice next?
[1:09:46] Doktor_Wyvern: @carryme40 scaling is the meta, and Jhin's chunks simply don't compare in DPS to...all carries
[1:10:02] finland2718: hes a rat KEKW
[1:10:10] dl_na_uzi_lul: Finally ES realized how bad an LMS player can be
[1:10:11] Optyfenx: @RangedLegit true, but wink was legit really good imo on a losing team, hard to replace him. i think wink coulda been top 5 adc tbh
[1:10:24] riot_games_belongs_to_cn: what's today's match Kappa it seems like yesterday
[1:10:28] mote9x: whats wrong with the title
[1:10:40] NiceKevin: Title wrong
[1:10:46] glennyver: pp god?
[1:10:50] RangedLegit: @samsonkoek123 I agree, but I really think ES macro is where its going wrong, they have such a good jg/sup and FenFen really is not bad
[1:10:56] guhleezy: I think omg is a team who can not take advantage of estar weak mid and top lane. Wink wasn’t the main issue this summer but I think rat is an upgrade. Estar win due to omg being one of the worst micro and can’t take advantage of their weak 2 lanes
[1:11:01] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: SHIAUC MingLee
[1:11:06] finland2718: THERES NO WAY A RAT CAN DO ANYTHING OTHERE THAN SUICIDE BOMBING SO THEEY WILL lose
