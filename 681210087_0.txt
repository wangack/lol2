[5:48:45] SpiritedHarvest: @alphahypedog read about it, it's not a secret
[5:49:00] SpiritedHarvest: @alphahypedog your entire narrative is ANECDOTAL
[5:49:02] martlet42: is ppgod a muslim country though?
[5:49:06] 妳的兒子: I'm so happy BloodTrail BloodTrail
[5:49:07] hermeneutist: china is even trying to gain favour with iran, just to stick to US
[5:49:08] kenguin35: @alphahypedog Im just curious why you blindly trust evidence given to you on the internet that could easily be manipulated

[5:50:40] SpiritedHarvest: @alphahypedog I like how you admit you get your news from anecdotal articles instead of following a scientific approach
[5:50:41] beet000: Edg LUL
[5:50:47] SkepticID: @raffaeilo I'm just saying the muslim countries won't dare offend China, it's true look at every other issue

[5:51:11] kenguin35: again, Im just curious why you blindly trust evidence given to you on the internet that could easily be manipulated
[5:51:15] SpiritedHarvest: @SkepticID that makes no sense, the same Muslim countries are occupied and more heavily coerced by NATO,
[5:51:15] alphahypedog: @kenguin35 @raffaeilo still haven't heard any evidence from either of you two. LULW

[5:51:56] kenguin35: @alphahypedog again, stop trying to avoid my question
[5:51:58] hermeneutist: people aren't "anti china", it's usually specifically anti-CCP
[5:52:05] SkepticID: @raffaeilo only after Saudi Arabia said they support China did other countries follow suit

[5:55:13] ミラクルー: pog
[5:55:16] kenguin35: world police USA lol
[5:55:17] davesterl0l: @raffaeilo Agree on that, but you agree communism, fscism and one-party states are non-optimal?
[5:55:26] natsukawa_a: USa sucks too XD
[5:55:27] SkepticID: @kenguin35 the US is worse but two wrongs don't make a right, besides many countries abuse human rights
[5:55:32] SpiritedHarvest: @hermeneutist read the Harvard study, bigoted asshole, you are just plain wrong
[5:55:42] hermeneutist: @jainnatools are u actually asking how CCP sucks? go read CCP's wikipedia article
