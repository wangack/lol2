[1:41:24] szechuan_pandas: @The_Most_Interesting_Guy Usually in LPL 8 wins is the maximum wins you need to secure the playoff spot, unless there are few teams losing every matches

[1:55:59] icant_kekw: @MetaSlave_ Puff is a role player but NOT a reliable insurance policy. IG had Jackeylove as insurance even when TheShy, Ning, and Rookie had off days, and Puff doesn't fulfill the same role. It's a clear downgrade and you're heavily underselling jackey's role in the team
[1:56:04] sxlitvry: Why do people defend Puff? He is never the reason why IG wins games. If TheShy or Rookie or Ning don't show up, Puff is garbage
[1:56:08] IRageU78: We need IG Uzi to happen

[1:57:27] MetaSlave_: @QUOTE_IF_PPGOD I don't disagree with anything you said, and i'm not trying to undersell JKL's role. I agree Puff is a downgrade and if anyone says otherwise they are actually insane. I just feel like Puff plays the weak side role well enough, and if IG doesn't qualify to world's he won't be the reason
[1:57:28] sxlitvry: Both TheShy and Uzi ego's too big for the team. Only Rookie is selfless
[1:57:29] safsagsaasg: The reason why Jackeylove left is because the resources are just not enough for 3 carries
[1:57:34] yigeiwoligiaog: @quote_if_ppgod thats true , ig teammember say that
[1:57:44] Jesus_ls_Here: after UZI left RNG it came clear that he had to carry a few apes for so long imagine if he had an actual team around him

[1:58:04] szechuan_pandas: @JesuslsHere Ning is inconsistent for sure, if his jg routine got out jungled, only thing he could do is give a nice Lee sin kick at the end of the game, which almost every LPL jg could do it except Xx

[1:58:06] 水原千鶴的老公: FPX LOST TO RW KEKW
[1:58:09] icant_kekw: @MetaSlave_ I guess what I'm trying to say is that Puff isn't an insurance policy like Jackeylove was, and IG won't go far internationally with him
[1:58:10] sxlitvry: @JesuslsHere LUL yeah just look at RNG with Betty instead of Uzi. Mid tier team
