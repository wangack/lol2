[1:08:22] vaaljiiva01: @sxlitvry yeah im not denying that, i just honestly think that they seem like they're hot cause the league isnt in a good state right now, i guess we'll all see at worlds (if they even happen)

[2:40:12] Jesus_ls_Here: @0024 these are 2 different games, these are analysts their job is to detect what teams do worng/right and explain it to the viewers, it's like an educational cast, regular sports there is no suffocated mechanisms and strategies the goal is simple you just have to narrate what's happening sports you have to explain the micro things that happen and go unnoticed
