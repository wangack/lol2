[4:56:42] irlgigachad: saying leyan is matchfixing gives him more credit than he deserves, ig is a team that potentially could win worlds. Getting rid of leyan means he likely won't be helping if ning is in int mode and its best to dispose of him. Champion tier teams don't just dump bad players when they have an inconsistent player at the same role
