[0:48:20] convenlent: they should win this fairly easily
[0:48:44] irlgigachad: im a suning fan so ill admit im biased, but these guys could take a bo5 off any of the top teams
[0:48:46] friggin_randy: Todays games are clean 2-0
[0:48:54] friggin_randy: Sn 2-0 vg 2-0
[0:49:16] irlgigachad: none of the teams in lpl this year resemble the powerhouse that was ig 2018
[0:49:18] R1PP3RZx: @friggin_randy Should be, but maybe they sleep at some drafts... It happens
[0:49:46] friggin_randy: it really does, betting on league is extremely hard
[0:49:51] convenlent: drafting definitely plagues suning at times. Regardless theyll be too strong for omg tonight
[0:50:22] friggin_randy: because of draft and teams tendencies to get too comfortable after a first win @R1PP3RZx
[0:50:33] R1PP3RZx: I'm pretty sure that both will win the series
[0:50:43] R1PP3RZx: But 2-0s.... Idk
[0:50:43] stvn_p: damn this song is such a banger
[0:50:50] irlgigachad: yeah speaking on sunings draft, the coach loves to pick meta and it mostly harms bin imo. Bin is often forced onto picks hes not comfy or thrives on
[0:51:03] flukkas: pepeD pepeD
[0:51:06] TJ_Carter_: RlyTho
[0:51:29] friggin_randy: tbh I think SN will take the series vs FPX, they're looking shaky atm
[0:51:38] evazer0x: imagine going from last song to this
[0:52:02] irlgigachad: its also worth noting the ig / jdg series they were in position to win some of the games, but threw. They've gotten better since that time as has the other teams, sn still needs to refine macro
[0:52:17] 곽동훈이랑결혼할사람: what music name ?
[0:52:47] sharperfisel: who
[0:52:50] R1PP3RZx: @friggin_randy we have to consider that OMG and DMO are surely out of playoffs, we can say the only team that has preassure here is VG
[0:52:54] sharperfisel: you guys got to win dmo vs vg
[0:52:59] h011ywood: suning might knock fpx out of playoffs
[0:53:01] irlgigachad: id agree with you, but i dont expect them to do what ig did last year where knocked out early in playoffs then somehow run the gauntlet in regionals
[0:53:36] irlgigachad: lol @ junglers in regionals last year ig got to go up against: flawless and xx
