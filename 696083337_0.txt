[3:11:23] opicarusx: @hermeneutist ok thx
[3:11:26] rotciv_victor: i mean that doesn't take much money, and it's a good advertising for LPL. at least they should allow some individual streamer to do the cast
[3:11:36] hermeneutist: VG is also freaking unpredictable
[3:11:49] taomuang: Kkoma Magic SeemsGood

[3:16:26] fazed343: @0024 i gues they dont know KEKW
[3:16:26] rotciv_victor: in Chinese platform i can just streaming lec,Lcs by streaming twitch and do my own casting(can't do this without permission for lck and LPL in china), it should allow twitch streamer do the same thing too
[3:16:37] haveier: why no one bans aphelios?
[3:16:53] 삼도천심해어: slowest patch but its 10.15 LUL
[3:17:00] Munchinsteaks: both teams got a strong draft imo

[3:18:13] jequitigalo: tnc dessa ad flongo macalao
[3:18:19] Munchinsteaks: no matter the comp aphelleos on a good adc is just late game win would be stupid by any coach to not pick it with an orrn
[3:18:22] domino_bj: draft 50/50 guys
[3:18:23] devinci_gg: VG better draft
[3:18:23] burnmild1234: Vg better team
[3:18:30] SirGraveto: lgd has to win early basically
[3:18:38] Munchinsteaks: draft is defo 50/50
[3:18:41] hermeneutist: ornn + aph is pretty insane mid-late spike
[3:18:56] beyond_the_aeons: lgd has better poke potential
[3:18:57] sirslumpedski: LGD picked a comp to run into VG....
[3:18:57] domino_bj: VG win first map and match win LGD 2:1 u will see
[3:18:59] hermeneutist: but LGD's poke comp is a good way to counter that
[3:19:04] sirslumpedski: but they have a comp to run into LGD
