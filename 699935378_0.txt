[0:34:18] safsagsaasg: @NaIsGigaTrash I never watched DWG so I dont know about their matchup against TES and IG top/jungle, because these 2 teams did expose weaknesses in this split, but u saying if rookie and knight are better than DWG mid than I must be trolling, I disagree
[0:34:18] youngermoocow: what song is this

[0:35:31] callmegilgamesh: Is there a better support than PPGOD?
[0:35:37] Jesus_ls_Here: I think you guys have different standards for aggression running it down and trying to pick up fights 24/7 is not how league is necessarily played, IG learned that the hard way and even they stopped doing that
[0:35:40] chiko0410: ig is back on form because baolan is back
[0:35:40] Munchables: @poocas99 WE sometimes just mess draft up and OMG have had some surprising games recently

[0:38:52] icant_kekw: @Munchables It's most likely RNG or FPX getting the final spot right?\
[0:39:19] yigeiwoligiaog: @naisgigatrash But if you look at the first round of DRX and DWG, they have a big advantage in the first, but they also lost, so I think they are not as strong as you said
[0:39:25] TroopZon: I think FPX won't make it this year
[0:39:27] vaaljiiva01: @Munchables someone probably already asked it, but do you know where we can find the playlist of the LPL? The songs you're rockign are insane
