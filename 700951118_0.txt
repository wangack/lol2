[0:45:59] genesis210: Knight is the only consistent player on TES rn
[0:46:05] prislight: but one of their lost is from geng so
[0:46:07] prislight: maybe
[0:46:39] prislight: drx is just good at clutching
[0:46:44] lostboy917: bro am I gonna see some games or listen to these geezers

[0:47:36] WJ20110720: T1 will win playoffs somehow.
[0:47:42] dg_bladee: knight, rookie or showmaker
[0:47:51] Grobyc117: Deft wouldn't do well on DWG imo he wants to be the carry
[0:47:52] prislight: yeah thata pretty much how t1 works
[0:48:04] prislight: sleep the whole season and turn on at play off
[0:48:07] genesis210: T1 actually looking better without Faker LULW
[0:48:09] dg_bladee: ghost is insane
[0:48:10] HANSUN20: PPGOD
[0:48:12] CandySlash: showmaker isnt that bad tho
[0:48:26] script__kiddie: put T1 Clozer against good team , he will get Rekt and fanboys brains will go boom lol
[0:48:26] Grobyc117: I mean it's easy to look better when cuzz and effort aren't inting 24/7
[0:48:27] dg_bladee: imo showmaker best mid lck rn
[0:48:32] prislight: showmaker got the buffs from sunni
[0:48:44] genesis210: Showmaker is the best mid in LCK
[0:48:54] yldrmist: does rookie have a girlfriend?
[0:49:02] prislight: he missed lots of zoe q tho
[0:49:03] Grobyc117: Yeah he's a beast he could start for half the league easily some of the lck mids are bad at the bottom
[0:49:07] skybullet07: showmaker gives all his mejai stacks to sunmi
[0:49:14] CandySlash: eu need more clutch midlaners tbh
[0:49:17] dg_bladee: chovy prob is but rn showmaker looks better
[0:49:24] thatsdanny4u: Clozer made T1 win 2-0 on 2 games in 1 week

[0:59:14] HpRking: larsen is not even close to caps. caps has shown he can go well against the best of mids
[0:59:18] CandySlash: caps still the best mid in eu even if g2 is playing bad
[0:59:23] yldrmist: is yone open during worlds?
[0:59:28] script__kiddie: lol @mnsapobvfdiu have u ever heard about douyu app ?? or u think world revolves around your country???
[0:59:29] trullsens: g2 is just trolling as a whole, there is literally no cohesion this split at all
[0:59:43] CandySlash: but we also know how he sucked against lpl mids
[0:59:43] HpRking: caps t3 mid NO CAP
[0:59:49] NightcityVibes: @Grobyc117 true!!
[0:59:54] Birphon: rooThink but LoL as 81.3K viewers right now mnsapobvfdiu
[1:00:06] dg_bladee: ??? rng beat tes
[1:00:17] conceitedmodesty: the reason why g2 has not been great is because of the fact that Perkz hasn't been active in the split. it's only now that they're getting good practice. usually Perkz id the one to lead the draft as he is the captain.
[1:00:18] CandySlash: rng 2-0 tes
[1:00:19] aleksi1337: this was recorded before mate
[1:00:21] HpRking: caps in both worlds final had a massive te diff, not a mid diff.
[1:00:25] skrillexgaucho: knight or nosferus ? only time will tell us who was better
[1:00:27] dg_bladee: oops lol
[1:00:46] CandySlash: wasnt perkz sick or something?
[1:00:47] zooohh: @NaIsGigaTrash jankos has been quite afk too
[1:01:01] skrillexgaucho: Nosferus > knight
[1:01:01] HpRking: perkz dad died and he took a break for mental regain
[1:01:02] aleksi1337: why lpl fanboys so cringe?we all know lpl is the best for 3years,but eu is clear 2nd
[1:01:07] Grobyc117: He was feeling burnt out kind of like doublift was last split
[1:01:16] CandySlash: ah rip
[1:01:16] zooohh: @CandySlash his dad passed away
[1:01:18] Birphon: everyone has been AFK this split. Covid hecked everything rooShrug
[1:01:25] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: perkz is not the main problem of g2 i mean in spring caps was even worse i think and g2 wasnt that bad
[1:01:37] Grobyc117: RNG without Uzi KEKW
[1:01:42] Taag69: RNG Sadge
[1:01:44] aleksi1337: RNG make top4
[1:01:48] NightcityVibes: @aleksi1337 eu doesn't realize it since msi
[1:01:51] zooohh: yeah it just happens
[1:01:53] HpRking: yeah perkz knows he is streaming playing bad though. he keeps saying sorry in teamspeak. he keeps dying in sidelanes
[1:01:53] RKgalahad: Rng beat TES 2-0 lol
[1:02:05] Grobyc117: That just shows TES isn't that good
[1:02:05] CandySlash: rng did smash tes tho
[1:02:21] script__kiddie: when Meta will change all these one tricks on Zoe and Ezreal will get their bumm beat in worlds
[1:02:21] zooohh: but Caps shown everyone that he can still be a 1v9 player
[1:02:24] Grobyc117: IG smashes everyone if they don't randomly int
[1:02:28] HpRking: cait is op. 1500 auto with 3 items
[1:02:32] skrillexgaucho: Just Ranger jungler for flamengo understand a patching jungle ok ? just ranger....
[1:02:32] sebastiannn2003: IG
[1:02:40] CandySlash: is their even any hard carry mid in eu masters or lower eu leagues?
[1:02:55] darkzzito: he literally said that he wasn't confident in his cait in korizon interview
[1:02:57] O_Quebrada: !uptime
[1:02:58] Moobot: @Draxz_Jota Uptime: 1h 3m :)
[1:03:01] HpRking: caps. 13 kill pogmaw
[1:03:02] conceitedmodesty: the meta won't change this year as you can see it's heading this was into next patch worlds.
[1:03:04] zooohh: @CandySlash Lider LULW
[1:03:08] louisforte: wait VG still has a chance at playoffs?
[1:03:12] HomeMakerJake: !uptime
[1:03:24] Grobyc117: Yeah the meta isn't gonna change from what it is now except maybe a few champ changes
[1:03:26] CandySlash: but lider hardly cant play non assasins
[1:03:26] huntiandi: is this a replay?
[1:03:43] kalmilon: no
[1:03:44] HpRking: i wish it was sylas akali meta. it was so fun to watch
[1:03:48] SFRangerDemo: After the games we saw yesterday in the LPL you seriously dont think we could see something wacky! going into playoffs.
[1:03:49] huntiandi: 30mins @glassteagall
[1:03:56] Grobyc117: Sett nerf wasn't enough to push him out of support
[1:04:01] Yisxhu: this was filmed last friday if im not wrong
[1:04:08] Grobyc117: He still has that insane instant teamfighting
[1:04:12] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: @conceitedmodesty doesnt matter if the meta doesnt change a single patch can make a team super bad if they dont adapt correctly
[1:04:13] zooohh: yeah sylas/akali can become a thing again
[1:04:16] Yisxhu: so some info is oudated
[1:04:29] Grobyc117: The nimbus nerf is big I'll give you that but that effects like every jungle
[1:04:32] HpRking: sylas needs armor buff:(
[1:04:48] Grobyc117: I mean if you can be flexed to 3 lanes in pro you are op
[1:04:57] Birphon: why does the LoL image of whats happening in the patch have a key on Nerfs but not a key on buffs
[1:05:03] Birphon: rooThink
[1:05:09] CandySlash: sett jungle is also a thing
[1:05:14] Juicypika: AYAYA
[1:05:17] conceitedmodesty: @tag_me_if_u_are_brainless true and next patch 10.17 is going to be skipped so this patch is going to be longer than usual. patch 10.18 is going to be massive apparently and that's the worlds patch
[1:05:22] Grobyc117: I mean so is akali, ryze, azir, sett, kalista
[1:05:25] zooohh: sett as a champ isnt op but maybe some teams still didnt figure out how to play against him
[1:05:29] Grobyc117: Lucian into botlane is basically an int
[1:05:53] Birphon: Lucian has nothing in bot rn
[1:06:05] YakHerd: @notkoopa it is hard to buff just because something isn't played because many champs aren't played because they don't match comp even if they are strong in soloq
[1:06:10] zooohh: @NaIsGigaTrash just look at selfmade's sett 4Head
[1:06:29] HpRking: i want to see more picks in general. it was fun to see malphite, wukong, kog maw camille
[1:06:36] Grobyc117: He isn't better than Cait or Ashe so he will never be played bot
[1:06:37] zooohh: hahaha
[1:06:40] louisforte: is 10.16 out yet?
[1:06:40] tag_me_if_u_are_brainless: sett is op becasue of nimbus cloak
[1:06:40] axeeew: whatre the names of the casters?
[1:06:50] Juicypika: AYAYA
[1:06:52] HpRking: not azir corki aphelios lee sin voli
[1:06:58] Birphon: Lucian is out damaged and out ranged in bot, has to take risky plays just to get creeps
[1:07:06] BestIZedIZimbabwe: Isn't Kkoma on Vici?
[1:07:08] BestIZedIZimbabwe: ?
[1:07:17] liverpool_numba1: yes
[1:07:19] HpRking: and why font teams ban aphelios, whoever gets him 1v9s at least once
[1:07:20] Grobyc117: That's why they are blind picking and first picking ashe because she's easy to stop KEKW
[1:07:22] YakHerd: kkoma is vg yes
[1:07:24] CandySlash: yes
[1:07:48] CandySlash: lpl picking aphe stil?
[1:07:57] bustling_spleen: Yes
[1:07:59] Grobyc117: Well yeah as a mid or top counterpick that can smash lane
[1:08:05] bustling_spleen: 1st pick all the time
[1:08:07] 猴哥的粉絲: akan0813something akan0813something
[1:08:16] weaponofmd: yep, get rid of kkoma please. VG spent so much money and can't even get in playoffs, wtf
[1:08:23] ToTFlame: ezpActivate ezpActivate ezpActivate
[1:08:24] YakHerd: ashe is picked for engage and slow along with a safe lane. that is why they pick her. team play isn't all about damage.
[1:08:36] zooohh: does LPL play sona/lux ?
[1:08:38] HpRking: i had a talon lose to lucisn in sq and i lost my mind
[1:08:39] liverpool_numba1: but the shy pick lucian 0-3 in MSC KEKW
[1:08:45] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @ericknick80231 like wtf even is that channel? It's so confusing
[1:08:52] conceitedmodesty: @hprking that used to be the case but not anymore. he's really really weak now and it takes him even longer to come online. usually 2 items Aphelios is gg. but after the crescendum and infernum nerfs and runaan's nerfs. his weaknesses are more potent than before
[1:09:23] Grobyc117: That's like every assassin right now
[1:09:28] conceitedmodesty: assassins in general are not in a good spot right now
[1:09:31] HpRking: yeah i havent seen him this patch so hopefully he is gutted
[1:09:33] CandySlash: talon is good for smurfing
[1:09:45] zooohh: best assassin is Ornn
[1:09:57] Bdo13: what about korea LUL
[1:10:40] BestIZedIZimbabwe: JackeyLove was 17 and won Worlds no?
[1:10:50] HpRking: theshy just needs a ward he dies by every gank possible and somehow still bullies enemy laner after
[1:10:52] YakHerd: there are plenty of powerful assassins rn, they are the mobile ones. leblanc, akali, etc are pretty popular in team play.
[1:11:23] CandySlash: havent seen qiyana in a while..is she that bad?
[1:11:33] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @naisgigatrash I agree that IG Top and Mid was absolutely insane but JackeyLove was good as well
[1:11:37] Grobyc117: Yeah the butt blasted her over and over again with pro nerfs
[1:11:53] HpRking: they nerfed qiyana attack speed and she got gutted:(
[1:12:00] CandySlash: jkl flashed and won them the game 5 vs kt tho i think
[1:12:10] conceitedmodesty: @hprking the reason why TheShy dies is not because of that. he just didn't respect the ganking possibilities. now that he's continuously been bashed. he started respecting it
[1:12:25] aatroxs_last_dance: Wait am i here at the end of stream or beginning?
[1:12:34] YakHerd: @hprking theshy intentionally plays as if the jungler is not there. he gains as much when the jungler isn't as he loses when he is, and if the jungler is always there is frees rookie and ning up to carry through bot. it is the team style.
[1:12:44] Grobyc117: @Scottez23 time before the games
[1:12:53] WJ20110720: yeah ig kt game3 and 5 really interesting.
[1:12:57] Grobyc117: Everyone on CLG sucks though
[1:13:00] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @scottez23 beginning. look top right timer
[1:13:03] Grobyc117: that whole team needs to be dumpstered
[1:13:09] watsupyouguys: OMG was good a long time ago lol,,,
[1:13:19] genesis210: WHO CAN STILL MAKE PLAYOFFS ??
[1:13:31] HpRking: i dont ever want theshy to be passive, i just want a ward lol
[1:13:41] YakHerd: the bubble is around fpx
[1:13:44] aatroxs_last_dance: bruh how did i miss that HAHA
[1:13:45] ayoub_ammor: OMG in worlds 2013 feelsoldman
[1:13:51] BestIZedIZimbabwe: WE, RNG and FPX play for Playoffs
[1:14:31] firechicken177: imagine if FPX don't make playoffs kekw
[1:14:41] BestIZedIZimbabwe: 2 spots left in playoffs
[1:14:57] Juicypika: ERIC PogU
[1:15:12] genesis210: @BestIZedIZimbabwe So one of those 3 is not gonna make it.. Ty
[1:15:16] hurleyguy82: What is this ? Lmao
[1:15:26] firechicken177: I feel bad for Dagda (and whoever is in the middle) during tricasts because he has to turn both ways when the other two casters are talking.
[1:15:29] WJ20110720: if FPX can‘t win SN, It's done.
[1:15:32] addyaddy11: A talk show?
[1:15:33] RS_Klatex: PPGOD Pog
[1:15:44] hurleyguy82: Reality show?
[1:15:44] CandySlash: honestly fpx not playing that good..they dont deserve worlds spot rn
[1:15:47] HpRking: if fpx doesnt make worlds doinb might retire. he wanted to retire but then got some passion back. not making worlds could destroy it(also give more passion but not likely)
[1:15:52] Bajors: CAEAYARON
[1:15:52] BestIZedIZimbabwe: @wj20110720 no not necessarily
[1:16:00] firechicken177: DoinB wil retire to NA
[1:16:08] CandySlash: fpz just winning random late game teamfights and ending after being like down whole game
[1:16:13] YakHerd: yeah about fox but rng and we are not playing that great either
[1:16:15] firechicken177: I heard CLG is looking for a new mid :LUL:
[1:16:17] meromorphic: hi chat AYAYA /
[1:16:23] genesis210: I agree. FPX doesn't really deserve world spot the way they're playing rn
