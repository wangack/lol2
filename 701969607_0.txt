[1:49:49] jimothy26: yeah LPL has a Solo Q meets pro play vibe where mechanics get you further than other regions and macro isn't the main focus at first glance. it's really exciting to watch how quick and snappy the decisions are made. @lyriclols it seems like every LPL player will pull the trigger when they see an opportunity

[1:51:18] lyriclols: @jimothy26 Yeah, i heard Bwipo say on SI that he feels like thats why LPL has such a good grasp of the current game because they treat SoloQ/Proplay the same. it was an interesting take

[4:21:19] SirDof: bardo
[4:21:24] icant_kekw: @Cheesebawwlz so there's actually a good chance that RNG could make playoffs assuming they 2-0, since WE and FPX are against strong opponents
[4:21:25] austinisbadatgame: rng get into playoffs if they win and fpx or WE lose since they have a better winrate
[4:21:30] austinisbadatgame: 2-1 still gets them in
[4:21:32] Sommii: ok we lead now we can throw again
[4:21:34] sxlitvry: RNG make playoffs if they win this series 2-1 AND win their next series 2-0 AND FPX only win 2-1 over SN. RNG will be +6 in game difference, FPX will only be +5

[4:22:28] icant_kekw: @kornflakes213 Yeah, We is probably gonna lose to TES and FPX Suning is a hard one to predict
[4:22:42] davidhola23: @babysivil i see fnatic games and i mean, he is good but u cant compare him with caps right now, caps is carrying g2 and nemesis was kinda inting the last weeks
