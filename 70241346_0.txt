[0:33:21] RawerPower: I always look for a woman who has a tattoo. I see a woman with a tattoo, and I’m thinking, okay, here’s a gal who’s capable of making a decision she’ll regret in the future.
[0:33:39] Jay2350: @Rawerpower Yes,
[0:33:53] Jay2350: Is LPL always this empty?

[0:35:00] innu2919: 4Head bronze chat
[0:35:07] RawerPower: she'd be ok if she'd lose the nose ring
[0:35:08] Jay2350: I like those headsets though.
[0:35:17] NipsTheGodly: nah dude her voice tho
[0:35:26] jaso444: she doesnt have a voice for casting
[0:35:28] Jay2350: Not just the nose rings.. They are asymmetrical
[0:35:31] RawerPower: wtf cares about her voice
[0:35:45] NipsTheGodly: i hate her nasty tattoo and her cancerous voice
[0:35:48] Jay2350: One middle and one left is odd.
[0:35:59] NipsTheGodly: shes *** in london and talking american
[0:36:00] Chipathy: better than the eu casters at least
[0:36:10] Jay2350: She's not American?
[0:36:25] galerito1: hiiii guys HeyGuys
[0:36:37] RawerPower: no, she's from some nordic EU country
[0:36:50] Jay2350: ehh. Close enough to America :^)
[0:37:17] Chipathy: Better to look weird than sleep with minors :^(
[0:37:18] Jay2350: I know someone that talks like her.
[0:37:19] Aorigi: !title

[0:37:48] Jay2350: Yo.... Relax on the Krepo hate fam
[0:37:48] Tsechaklam: 957 and V
[0:37:49] PoliticalMuffin: pretty sure she's from Oregon or something
[0:38:04] RawerPower: A tier players that play S tier games. What does that even mean ?
[0:38:09] Jay2350: What's her name?
[0:38:24] Jay2350: S tier = god tier
[0:38:42] jaso444: UZI PogChamp
[0:38:55] Jay2350: A tier = great tier.. Not as good as S but S is normally 1 or 2 teams/players/champs
[0:39:01] RawerPower: Indiana "Froskurinn" Black
[0:39:07] yutawatanabe: aren't they all australian
[0:39:12] Jay2350: @Nipsthegodly how do you know?
[0:39:41] Jay2350: Good says she's American.
[0:39:54] Jay2350: That's wayyyyyy too high.
[0:40:07] jaekun93: To be fair LPL's stats presentation is superior
[0:40:07] invey1: u make 2.4
[0:40:20] invey1: 2.5 $ per sub genius
[0:40:24] Jay2350: ^
[0:40:27] RawerPower: my bad, I thiught she was from norduc EU as she lived there before moving to Australia
[0:40:41] Jay2350: Subs pay $5. The content creator gets about half.
[0:41:00] galerito1: and the AD's
[0:41:02] NipsTheGodly: The more popular streamers pull in from a $1.00 - $2.50 range. The standard subscriber rate of $4.99/month starts off on a 50/50 split between Twitch and the streamer, but is open to scaling with their viewership and streamers can earn up to 60/40 — about $3.00 per subscriber.

[0:45:10] Chipathy: newbee should win but ya anything can happen
[0:45:30] PoliticalMuffin: you underestimate pentaq
[0:45:41] Hlimleslie: spawn knows drag spawns
[0:45:45] KinGPaYeR: swain tank!
[0:45:56] jaekun93: It should be a close one
[0:46:13] Jay2350: What is an NA comparison to these teams?
[0:46:15] Chipathy: depends if dade can do well and how hard swift can carry
[0:46:15] Zim4ikGG: Ekko ap

[0:49:10] Jay2350: I've never watched LPL
[0:49:12] Chipathy: I've been a qiao gu fan since they were in the lspl
[0:49:16] emryx: First time loo?
[0:49:40] Hlimleslie: yeah i started watching their rookie split
[0:49:41] Zethr0s: DADE!
[0:49:53] Hlimleslie: rip
[0:50:01] Chipathy: I'll miss doinb but I welcome the future of newbee as well I have high hopes
[0:50:08] KinGPaYeR: swain in game is defeat indeed
[0:50:13] Jay2350: what did doinb play?
[0:50:19] Chipathy: mid
[0:50:26] Hlimleslie: gotta keep swift happy i guess
[0:50:33] Chipathy: it's a long story and alot of drama
[0:50:35] Jay2350: and they benched him?
[0:50:58] nothingishappening: doinb is on newbees lspl team now
[0:51:03] fnask10: gt gonna win
[0:51:09] Jay2350: oh.. LPL Challenger team?

[0:52:07] nothingishappening: who GT's sub jungler again?
[0:52:11] Chipathy: like I said alot of drama lol
[0:52:46] Jay2350: lol fair enough. He looks familiar. Doinb might be the only LPL player I recognize..
[0:52:51] Chipathy: it was basically between benching doinb or their jungler and the jungler is the team captain/star so rip doinb
[0:53:09] Jay2350: Like Aphro and DL in NA
[0:53:19] nothingishappening: or like cool and uzi in omg
[0:53:36] emryx: Uzi in Rng
[0:53:37] Chipathy: this drama was pretty ridiculous
[0:53:51] Hlimleslie: doinb sorta snitched on the org so its not like he can get picked up anywhere else
[0:54:05] Jay2350: Oh! That other Chinese team that I don't know! Kappa
[0:54:12] nothingishappening: he released chat logs and stuff
[0:54:31] Jay2350: Bring him to NA!
