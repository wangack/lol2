[4:51:55] CoolCalmCam: I don't think LCK has gotten worse as much as LPL and LEC have gotten better, though I do think the level of play in LCK has dropped a bit, it didn't drop enough to make them the 3rd best region imo
[4:52:13] lol_truman: @CoolCalmCam bit of both yh
[4:52:21] hotdogss: OMG would win LEC

[5:40:59] D4rs1nk: @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING dumb one is the 1st team and no they would lose even to S04 LUL
[5:41:06] tromfur: @D4rs1nk G2 on point can challenge most LCK teams, I'd say MAD could have a chance too considering they play very much like G2 did last year but it also depends on how well the LCK has grown since last worlds
[5:41:09] sxlitvry: Tbh there's a good chance someone lost a lot of money during last week when there were lots of upsets in LPL. He's pretty salty

[5:44:05] tromfur: @D4rs1nk G2 also beat SKT without playing around baron too btw but SKT this year is kinda shaky (Clozer could change that). Also G2 needs to get their shit together, they've been overall pretty bad this regular split

[5:48:15] yigeiwoligiaog: LUL
