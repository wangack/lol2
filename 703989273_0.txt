[2:10:49] ye1l: @hyzhii GP has a free lane vs Voli and it synergies very well with the rest of the team. GP gives them a lot of zone control, just like Cait and Ori does. Additionaly, WE has drafted a comp that NEEDS to run into TES, and they're on a timer to do that too since they get outscaled. GP would've made it nearly impossible for TES to lose this game
