[2:12:17] punishershoww: ;-;
[2:12:18] ibshoots: UZI has diabetes due to bad diet and a few joint issues I think.
[2:12:22] HOF_KINGPIN: @PatriusW and wait for him to decide whether to retire a whole split? waste of money
[2:12:25] azuredragonag: if UZI had good team members on each role, he would have 2 World championship already+

[2:12:29] icant_kekw: @vicviper Too bad RNG couldn't beat other relevant teams FeelsBadMan
[2:12:34] ye1l: @PatriusW didnt Uzi quit because his wrists got ruined from playing the game too much, like his doc said he had the arms of a 60 year old

[2:13:05] wonw20: 9-6?
[2:13:05] vicviper: RNG and EDG out of playoffs, the era of olf god has ended, PPGOD is the new god of LPL PogChamp

[2:13:15] PatriusW: @ye1l yep

[2:14:22] carryme40: @HaveFunGamingAG not all average, mlgx was a god. he came in for game 5 when karsa start choking, and carried rng on olaf and nocturne. MSI 2018 was an example.
[2:14:23] ye1l: @HaveFunGamingAG If LPL had been more developed at the time UZI would've probably had a record akin to Faker's, it wasn't about his teammates being bad, but rather the LPL being underdeveloped a tthe time.

[4:06:02] Youngkobe: @boborvegana ofc
[4:06:14] 474031180: S tier control
[4:06:15] KelvinTsang: they have very strict mearsure over their citizens that those measures are never possible to implement in the west
[4:06:17] whi7e7: it was so much more seriously handled in china

[4:09:34] paquitochocolateero: I also agree it was because S tier control since you dont wanna go against the guvernment there, much stricter than anyone in the west for sure. Maybe the numbers are not 100% accurate either, but i doubt they are much higher either
[4:09:56] goblinguy01: If they want Americans to wear mask, they will send in real military and border checks for inner state.
