I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after watching worlds 2019 I finally understand it. NA is just so free.

[1:53:38] Soerevik: 1As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after watching worlds 2019 I finally understand it. NA is just so free.
