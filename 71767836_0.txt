[4:16:33] edglm6695035: 3k viewers :) :) :)
[4:16:57] GNARGNARHEAD: IKR can hardly keep up with chat
[4:17:10] Mr__puddingg: looooooooooooooooooooool
[4:17:17] fnask10: it wasnt luck, Saint is just the worst team ever.. They lost like 4 straight teamfights with 10-15k lead (once with elder dragon too)
[4:17:28] fergem00: 3k wiewers= under 10 inn chat
[4:17:54] fergem00: ok
[4:18:10] AnadroJ: wow chat so fast guys, slow it down please

[4:21:06] GNARGNARHEAD: c'mon keep it civil @Danielkakashi
[4:22:42] fnask10: newbie sucks but yes, i dont really see why they wouldnt
[4:22:54] GNARGNARHEAD: ? they are a great team
[4:23:47] fergem00: well Saint is worse tho
[4:27:01] GNARGNARHEAD: lol
[4:27:17] pg0esde: Can NB win ?
[4:27:37] beCosmos: Which patch is it?
[4:27:47] GNARGNARHEAD: 100 gold down, will be a tough comeback
[4:31:06] Daruel_is_back: SoonerLater
[4:31:25] GNARGNARHEAD: welcome back
[4:31:43] TeeEndVN: Bronze dive
[4:32:45] Daruel_is_back: SAT are so dumb, unbelievable
[4:32:46] GNARGNARHEAD: you think any OPL team could stand up to either of them?
[4:32:59] GNARGNARHEAD: Kappa
[4:33:03] Daruel_is_back: SAT wouldn't even win OPL
[4:33:41] Daruel_is_back: they are completely retarded, this was the last time I bet on them
[4:33:48] Marshmalloli: CN LOL
[4:33:52] GNARGNARHEAD: imagine any OPL player getting millions of dollars and a weetbix contract
[4:36:44] Daruel_is_back: ???
[4:36:47] FrostedCupcakes_: dade LUL
[4:36:55] Daruel_is_back: this league is so trash FailFish
[4:37:03] GNARGNARHEAD: pay peanuts get monkeys :P
[4:38:40] GNARGNARHEAD: how do you control Azirs sand warrior thingys?
[4:39:05] GNARGNARHEAD: alt, or do they auto attack?
[4:39:51] Marowi: @Liquidscottie They replace Azir's auto attack - if you right click, they attack instead of him, if you press 's' they stop.
[4:40:06] GNARGNARHEAD: cool
[4:40:41] Daruel_is_back: they will throw, don't worry, this is a fking clown fiesta
[4:40:44] alibabie: NB's weakness is as huge as their strength
[4:41:05] GNARGNARHEAD: did he just try and pinch his red?
[4:41:50] alibabie: NB is kinda third tier in LPL right now
[4:42:00] GNARGNARHEAD: discipline is for those without talent
[4:44:26] GNARGNARHEAD: what about a giant character that takes two players to control
[4:44:47] pg0esde: LUCIAN R :'(
[4:45:18] sofm_hype: clown fiesta
[4:45:27] pg0esde: this league is funny..
[4:45:40] sofm_hype: these teams are funny
[4:46:03] GNARGNARHEAD: lol
[4:46:06] alibabie: how do you know they aren't raging
[4:46:13] GNARGNARHEAD: brutal
[4:46:29] GNARGNARHEAD: lol slow mode is on, good call LPL1
[4:47:11] alibabie: pros make mistakes too i guess
[4:47:18] GNARGNARHEAD: nods, that, or you don't know what you're talking about..
[4:47:36] GNARGNARHEAD: freaking slow mods Kappa *
[4:47:46] GNARGNARHEAD: mode* !
[4:48:33] GNARGNARHEAD: as long as we don't forget @Zarafrustra then it won't go unpunished
[4:48:35] alibabie: and how do you know people aren't booing right now?
[4:49:03] alibabie: thats just me thou
[4:49:15] GNARGNARHEAD: #SuicideBombingTime @Zarafrustra
[4:49:26] alibabie: i agree with you, NB should be so much better than this
[4:49:46] SmooveMusic: i did bet 100$ for SAT win 2nd game
[4:49:57] alibabie: you have no idea how toxic and intolerant the LoL community in China are
[4:50:04] GNARGNARHEAD: that might be overkill TBH, it's not like they have any chance of getting into Valhalla
[4:50:56] alibabie: you can't expect every team to be as good as barcelona
[4:51:06] GNARGNARHEAD: climb out of bronze and show them how its done bro #IbieleebInYou
[4:51:53] alibabie: there has to be 'better' teams, and when the better team comes, the rest of teams are considered 'bad'
[4:52:05] SmooveMusic: they can win this 2nd game... they tryhard :D
[4:52:16] GNARGNARHEAD: if anyone better comes along, they can replace them, until then.. enjoy the game
[4:52:39] FishRoeSoup: Chinese lol culture is heavily flawed anyways, its way more than tilt or paid to be good.
[4:53:35] GNARGNARHEAD: discipline is a disgusting trait
[4:53:39] alibabie: It typical error China has been making in recent times; flush money into something trending, but never want to actually refine it
[4:54:23] GNARGNARHEAD: that would be cool if each team had like 10 players and you could sub them out
[4:54:50] GNARGNARHEAD: probably not good for viewing tho, too much pausing
[4:55:10] alibabie: ofc discipline is the most important aspect not just in athlete career but all careers.
[4:55:36] GNARGNARHEAD: but if your too procedural your predictable and thus weak
[4:55:45] alibabie: players like Adriano and Pato are examples of lack of discipline
[4:55:58] pgx_key: In football you aren't at a disadvantage even if you're 7-0 down, but in lol if they have more gold than you and kill you over and over again it's pretty frustrating
[4:56:04] GNARGNARHEAD: if that logic worked then it would succeed
[4:56:18] nerobotas: noob ez :D :D :D
[4:56:47] GNARGNARHEAD: but its not like the field actually tilts
[4:57:04] CJDM310: why would you give up infernal dragon for free like that
[4:57:22] AngieFoxtrot: Newbee is making "Noobie" decisions
[4:57:24] pgx_key: i mean it's not harder to score goals if your x goals down, but in lol if they have more gold than you they have an advantage during the game whichcan be frustrating
[4:58:04] GNARGNARHEAD: but even if you were right, nothing would change @Zarafrustra
[4:58:14] FishRoeSoup: Even doinb was the main shotcaller, the other 4 QG members had been together for more than a year. It is painful to see synergy and decisions like this.
[4:58:56] AI_Logic: who the shotcaller now?
[4:59:11] GNARGNARHEAD: Rusty Kappa
[5:00:06] CJDM310: wait they totally could have taken mid
[5:00:07] SmooveMusic: hope i win 340$ :D i bet 100$ on SAT 2nd game win :D
[5:00:35] AI_Logic: rusty tilted on newbee gameplay, must have bet on them Kappa
[5:00:44] GNARGNARHEAD: any bet is a good investment, you do it to feel something not for the money Kappa
[5:00:51] Daruel_is_back: if they lose this game, they are on Silver 5 lvl
[5:01:09] AngieFoxtrot: Rusty is just going FailFish at every Newbee do
[5:01:30] CJDM310: that true damage Kreygasm
[5:01:33] Daruel_is_back: i'm going FailFish at the both teams, they are so fking bad
[5:01:58] GNARGNARHEAD: ^
[5:02:03] CJDM310: JUST FINISH FailFish
[5:02:05] Daruel_is_back: they won't even end yet xddddddddddd
[5:02:14] AngieFoxtrot: TBF I watch LPL for the EleGiggle and the FailFish
[5:02:16] Daruel_is_back: I'M DONE
[5:02:25] niachy: 173 LUL
[5:02:26] FishRoeSoup: This is painful, 0 coordination or knowing what to do
[5:02:54] AI_Logic: @Angiefoxtrot what about the 4Head?
[5:03:02] OhNotLikeThiz: What patch is this?
[5:03:03] Daruel_is_back: I mean RNG are pretty good internationally, but this 2 teams are wildcard level FailFish
[5:03:13] Daruel_is_back: *these
[5:03:27] FishRoeSoup: just realized dade only 3 and a half items at 40min ResidentSleeper
[5:04:22] SmooveMusic: where is winions ?:D
[5:04:55] GNARGNARHEAD: what a close
[5:04:59] nothingishappening: omg finqlly
[5:05:00] AI_Logic: that viktor damage Kreygasm
[5:05:08] AngieFoxtrot: Team too heavy, Dade can't carry them, his back is now broken
[5:05:11] SmooveMusic: I WINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN 340$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
[5:05:13] Daruel_is_back: not gonna bet on these teams anymore, this is like a fking coinflip
[5:05:22] FishRoeSoup: Convincing victory ResidentSleeper plz, far away from convincing
[5:05:42] GNARGNARHEAD: saver that feeling @Daruel_is_back
[5:06:04] sofm_hype: saint won? lol
[5:06:16] GNARGNARHEAD: "convincingly"
[5:06:32] sofm_hype: go for it
[5:06:33] AI_Logic: im not sure about the skill disparity between these teams and lgd or omg
[5:06:42] FishRoeSoup: It was mostly random fights and things going on, and eventually swain 1v5
[5:06:44] jakob98_: dade is in elohekk
[5:06:56] nothingishappening: wtf
[5:07:02] Daruel_is_back: they are both retarded, Saint wasn't able to end with 2 Barons and 10k gold lead
[5:07:04] AngieFoxtrot: wtf was that?
[5:07:04] lipppeee: TSM kappa
[5:07:07] Molonym: TSM
[5:07:12] Daruel_is_back: and Swain went 2 tank items against a Vlad
[5:07:12] fergem00: if NB loses then....
[5:07:24] GNARGNARHEAD: I would love to hear you explain why after they wipe the floor with you @Zarafrustra
[5:07:24] sofm_hype: lpl bottom teams are really terrible
[5:07:24] TRBLS: HUH is tsm playing in LPL?
[5:07:27] AngieFoxtrot: TSM photobomb LUL
[5:07:52] AI_Logic: this brainless shotcalling can only come from swift Kappa
[5:08:23] Daruel_is_back: I'm talking about the first game
[5:08:31] GNARGNARHEAD: I wouldn't go that far :P
[5:08:46] Daruel_is_back: it was wrong build for Swain
[5:08:57] crownsiesta: RNG vs EDG next week FeelsGoodMan
[5:08:59] Daruel_is_back: why the hell you build 2 tank items if you already have 2 tanks in the team
[5:09:03] FishRoeSoup: @Sofm_hype u have to know how LPL bottom teams are made. Always 2-3 bottom teams bought their spot, and made up of random players, like streamers or players relegated to TGA. But they only play in LPL because they have money.
[5:09:10] Daruel_is_back: and you got no dmg in the lategame
[5:09:14] nerobotas: music..
[5:09:21] GNARGNARHEAD: he was actively tanking tho
[5:09:52] FishRoeSoup: @Zarafrustra yes, but I mean teams like saint
[5:09:56] Daruel_is_back: yeah, he was tanking, but they were unable to kill anybody, cuz only Ezreal had dmg
[5:10:04] AI_Logic: or previously GT?
[5:10:07] Daruel_is_back: so the tanking is useless in the end
[5:10:31] GNARGNARHEAD: nods, killing the champions = wonned game
[5:10:50] GNARGNARHEAD: ?! s otroll
[5:10:57] Daruel_is_back: if he had Void + Rabadon instead of the 2 tank items, he would carry that game
[5:11:10] Daruel_is_back: if you want play Swain tank, play him toplane
[5:11:20] FishRoeSoup: @Zarafrustra just this game. saint got dumpstered in most matches, like someone forced them to play in LPL. It is just weired.
[5:11:25] Daruel_is_back: because you need an AP threat
[5:12:09] GNARGNARHEAD: ..new Voltron is pretty good
[5:12:27] SmooveMusic: 2nd bet :)
[5:12:32] Daruel_is_back: Swain is able to match Vlad in the lategame if he builds correctly, otherwise he is just another tank and nobody is able to kill Vlad
[5:12:52] GNARGNARHEAD: :O cute gril
[5:13:16] Daruel_is_back: well, they had a lead like 2k
[5:13:26] Daruel_is_back: but then they randomly got caught as usual
[5:13:49] Daruel_is_back: then Baron, 2nd Infernal and game over
[5:13:51] GNARGNARHEAD: :O Nutrigrain reference
[5:14:20] FishRoeSoup: Swain and vlad every game ResidentSleeper this meta sucks
[5:15:09] AI_Logic: Ban Vlad BabyRage
[5:16:45] 삼도천심해어: SKT won again ResidentSleeper
[5:16:45] FishRoeSoup: 2.7k viewer chat so fast ResidentSleeper viewbot much ResidentSleeper
[5:16:45] AI_Logic: @Fishroesoup you prefer corki v lulu over this? Kappa
[5:17:10] GNARGNARHEAD: can we take a moment to talk about that tie
[5:17:19] sofm_hype: 3 games ResidentSleeper i just want to watch edg
[5:17:25] GNARGNARHEAD: so blue, so organic.
[5:17:38] 삼도천심해어: saint won something Kreygasm
[5:18:02] GNARGNARHEAD: I hope NB flip that switch and just monster them
[5:18:05] fergem00: If NB lose
[5:18:11] FishRoeSoup: @Ai_logic oh well, both are ResidentSleeper But swain shouldnt be on pro level anyway, it is like master yi, too one directional
[5:18:19] GNARGNARHEAD: how good was it when SKT1 first hit worlds
[5:18:19] 삼도천심해어: newbee is from dota Kappa

[7:55:57] seveninchesunbuffed: Bang > Deft
[7:56:16] Support_eu: @aoiikitsune so will they? I really don't onow
[7:56:25] Zulkuss: AoiiKitsune, why would they make it 6 man skin? It's always the team from final game
[7:56:31] Avenuee3: i think if Deft play in KR he is better than Bang
[7:56:47] Support_eu: Stop underrate Bang
[7:56:57] Cynaris: xPeke > Bang Kappa

[7:57:22] AoiiKitsune: So, we’re holding off releasing these skins for now and looking for things we can do to make them even more awesome.And while we’re at it, we’ll be adding Azir. Making a skin for a sub was not something we’d had to consider before and we were worried about setting a precedent.
[7:57:26] 삼도천심해어: bang ezreal at msi EleGiggle
[7:57:36] AoiiKitsune: google skt skins 2016 pbe
[7:57:52] Support_eu: @aoiikitsune thanks
[7:58:16] Zulkuss: "Worried about precedent" - basically they are reluctant to make 6 team skins every year instead of 5 LUL
[7:58:21] 삼도천심해어: LGD
[7:58:24] Cynaris: SKT Ryze will ditch the cup, use Broccoli instead Kappa
[7:58:24] scavagelol: away since game 1, comes back sees no azir ban. im out
[7:58:26] Support_eu: @xpekeisg0d LGD
[7:58:54] Peedsllab8: But what if SKT wins every year do you just keep making SKT skins
[7:58:59] HakaruLovesU: what is this white haired boy called in this game?
[7:59:14] Peedsllab8: ezreal
[7:59:21] Cynaris: zulkuss, since some teams have like 5 subs now, it's understandable
[7:59:22] Zulkuss: HakaruLovesU, Ekko, the most annoying champ in the game
[7:59:23] Chunkalott: EU = haHAA
[7:59:28] scavagelol: imp is better than deft
[7:59:46] HakaruLovesU: Ekko or Ezreal now `?
[7:59:50] PepperJackCheeese: CHINESE FIESTA FeelsGoodMan
[7:59:50] scavagelol: well I mean it's subjective but imo deft is overrated as fk

[7:59:59] Zulkuss: SKT never won 2 Worlds in a row, so I doubt they will win
