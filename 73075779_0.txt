[0:47:01] Erikson1997: cool!
[0:47:15] Spawnthecaster: @Nothingishappening dom was from NA we just borrowed. PT also had hope to go there for awhile. so its pretty cool he got to go IMO
[0:47:24] Homlesstacoftw: @spawnde Are you going to move over to NA?
[0:47:25] Awakenedlightx3: I just want to see UZI play and see what the fuzz is all about
[0:47:26] TheTragicomical: Yeah it's super late and late night stuff like LPL doesn't pull the numbers that NA does, so there isn't really the whole uh, stupid bullshit.
[0:47:32] AoiiKitsune: so now that lpl has it's own channel do you guys have more control over the account? compared to before with riotgames2?

[2:41:13] FergusX: xwx is eloboosting a lspl team 4Head
[2:41:18] silbermondin: vayne > trundle
[2:41:32] TheTragicomical: Oh he's active again? Well seeing as the new dynamic queue makes eloboosting super easy to do he's probably rolling in the bucks. FrankerZ
[2:41:47] MobBecerra1933: trundle + pink > vayne
[2:42:36] TheTragicomical: Yes but he was the one who agreed to eloboost Kappa
[2:42:44] noamywife: V PogChamp
[2:43:42] ChaoS2751: one man mission lol
[2:44:32] krazy2xtreme: fish <3
[2:45:22] narakun: <3 Kreygasm
[2:45:31] ChaoS2751: so if swain vs trundle who will win
[2:45:35] Denisbg11: Volcania
[2:45:50] MobBecerra1933: Trundle be like: SwiftRage Come to kill me SwiftRage
[2:45:55] devil2710: faker lulu ResidentSleeper
[2:45:58] TheTragicomical: @ChaoS2751 Tough one, actually. Gimme a bit.
[2:46:37] MobBecerra1933: problem with swain: mana hungry even in mega late game
[2:46:49] shepi13: Trundle will beat swain 1 v 1, even if he can't kill him he has less mana issues and can probably push harder + take turrets faster
[2:46:49] noname1312: what headset are they using? :)
[2:47:22] TheTragicomical: Sadly that is the case. I think Swain is a BIT better for team fighting though due to having that nasty snare compared to Trundle's pillar.
[2:47:37] shepi13: trundle really isn't that good at team fighting imo, it's his main weakness
[2:47:41] TheTragicomical: Trundle is the split push king though, so take that as you will.
[2:47:55] MobBecerra1933: I think only a fed Jax can handle easly a trundle in a 1 v 1
[2:48:07] TheTragicomical: Or Teemo OpieOP
[2:48:31] shepi13: riven maybe early game can take short trades with shield or back off after subjugate, and gnar destroys trundle for the entire game
[2:48:33] MobBecerra1933: after the blind wars off: RIP Teemo
[2:48:43] AeroZara: @Mobbecerra1933 mundo can handle trundle if trundle doesnt build botrk
[2:49:03] krudeirl: what about vlad vs trundle?
[2:49:15] shepi13: someone like maokai can always just waveclear and win teamfights later
[2:49:24] TheTragicomical: Huh. Vlad vs Trundle would be a fun one.
[2:49:24] krudeirl: does vlad do well into trundle?
[2:50:00] krudeirl: i just wanna see RNG :(
[2:50:10] ttrpo: only tank that do relatively well against trundle is malphite
[2:50:19] TheTragicomical: Well, assuming Vlad builds barely any tank stats, that would make Trundle's ult moot unless you go for the move speed and health absorb. No AD to steal for chomp. Vlad does what Teemo and Gnar do but with more OOMPH.
[2:50:28] ttrpo: have both wave clear and attack speed slow
[2:50:31] MobBecerra1933: with spirit visage, I think vlad can hold a Trundle in mid and late game, But in early game vlad gets rekt by trundle
[2:51:12] TheTragicomical: wait, is this a civil conversation in a riot chat room? WutFace I can't handle this
[2:51:25] krudeirl: Thankyou @Thetragicomical <3
[2:51:33] AI_Logic: newbee win?
[2:51:47] MobBecerra1933: the 8 wonder of the world: a normal conversation in a Lol twitch chat
[2:51:55] TheTragicomical: Someone, hurry, say something awful with the ANELE emote to restore equilibrium WutFace
[2:52:06] TheTragicomical: NotLikeThis I don't like change, it's scary.
[2:52:07] shepi13: Nasus will eventually outscale trundle, but I have no clue how long it will take
[2:52:19] MuddyKippy: You can have civil conversations in a league related chatroom, usually it doesn't happen when there are over 3k viewers though :^)
[2:52:33] MobBecerra1933: it need like 800-1200 stacks to beat trundle
[2:52:34] ttrpo: if you can survive early game then nasus is fine but it's real hard
[2:52:35] TheTragicomical: That would be a bad idea though, shepi. While Nasus is a farmbot top lane Trundle is all over the place.
[2:52:55] krudeirl: ANELE
[2:53:05] TheTragicomical: see there's the ANELE , peace is restored AngelThump
[2:53:14] MobBecerra1933: the balance has been restored
[2:53:22] shepi13: How does fiora do vs trundle? I would think maybe ok with all the true dmg and no real resistances to steal
[2:53:36] krudeirl: fiora vs trundle seems like a skill matchup
[2:53:41] AI_Logic: What about this one TriHard Kappa
[2:53:46] ttrpo: fiora is great later stage
[2:53:54] krudeirl: being able to hit vitals ect
[2:54:03] TheTragicomical: TrIHard has fell out of popularity since the twitch trolls decided to focus on the emote ANELE
[2:54:09] krudeirl: u could bully the trundle out from a few good trades
[2:54:12] ttrpo: actually one of the few ad melee can 1v1 trundle later stage
[2:54:15] TheTragicomical: Wow. TriHard There we go
[2:54:25] Sunlessmidnight: I think trundle can easily interrupt Fiora with his Pillar
[2:54:30] MobBecerra1933: If trundle manages to stop fiora from hitting all the vitals during the ult, I think trundle can win the 1 v 1
[2:54:44] krudeirl: ANELE ANELE ANELE
[2:54:47] ttrpo: fiora is real mobile though
[2:54:50] 삼도천심해어: cmonBruh
[2:55:03] TheTragicomical: too much ANELE is bad for the humors BibleThump
[2:55:06] Sunlessmidnight: Can she dash through Pillar?
[2:55:12] MobBecerra1933: Yes
[2:55:20] AI_Logic: The spam during lcs is awful though, with vertical arabic letters spam
[2:55:27] krudeirl: oh god
[2:55:41] TheTragicomical: And the KappaPride and ANELE combos. Just. FeelsBadMan Makes me wonder why I bother.
[2:56:00] krudeirl: : (
[2:56:03] ChaoS2751: we need DDOS SIN for the inner peace ANELE
[2:56:04] 삼도천심해어: BigBrother hehe xd BigBrother
[2:56:35] TheTragicomical: And the fact Twitch hasn't removed ANELE despite it serving literally no purpose besides bigoted *** is beyond me, but hey, I'm sure there's a reason FrankerZ
[2:57:04] krudeirl: it does seem slightly racist..
[2:57:24] TheTragicomical: Emote itself isn't. It's used for nothing but exclusive racism.
[2:57:47] TheTragicomical: TriHard as well. Unless you get the 0.001% chance someone is trying to say someone's a try hard.
[2:57:57] AI_Logic: It won't matter if they remove it, were not mature enough and will continue to find other ways to be hateful for no apparent reason
[2:58:04] krudeirl: u pumped for the next game?? :D
[2:58:28] lordheigo: People writing ANELE is better than them writing "allahu akbar" or some sht like that imo
[2:59:01] TheTragicomical: Going to disagree. They're both equally awful.
[2:59:28] MobBecerra1933: We all make fun with everything we find. Personally ANELE is not disrespectful or racist, Its just an arab guy looking forward. No offenses found
[2:59:39] AI_Logic: TriHard Don't shoot, I have a gun TriHard = Example Kappa
[2:59:52] TheTragicomical: Not on its own, no. But Twitch has memed it into a racist corner.
[3:00:32] TheTragicomical: Same with OpieOP , the best emote, being used for fat jokes exclusively.
[3:00:44] TheTragicomical: Memed into a meaning.
[3:00:52] krudeirl: [

[3:02:38] decco41: HeyGuys
[3:02:48] AngieFoxtrot: Rusty <3 it was nice of you to decide to let Fish keep his pens after yesterdays pen dropping ;)
[3:02:49] AI_Logic: Best emotes = MingLee BrokeBack EleGiggle
[3:02:55] TheTragicomical: But all memes are are contagious ideas with programmed mental responses and blah blah blah BrokeBack
[3:03:04] RustyTheCaster: omg he is so useless at holding pens
[3:03:07] TheTragicomical: I'm fond of FrankerZ , OpieOP , and SMOrc
[3:03:33] krudeirl: SMOrc is pretty dank
[3:03:33] AngieFoxtrot: Frustrating for you Rusty, amusing for us to hear you tell him off

[3:03:57] RustyTheCaster: hi!
[3:04:11] MobBecerra1933: Better to be like this than spamming nonenses and screaming abuses all over the chat
[3:04:15] TheTragicomical: I've taken a fondness to PJSugar as of late. It's a very sweet emote.
[3:04:31] RustyTheCaster: clever use of the word sweet.
[3:04:33] jarvitz: @Rustythecaster what do I do if /remake didnt pop up when it should have other than post a bug report? It tilted me and when the midlaner showed up 5 mins later if i wasnt tilted to all hell we could have won :/
[3:04:40] TheTragicomical: @RUSTYTheCASTER Thank you for noticing OpieOP

[3:07:09] TheTragicomical: KappaPride --[ ] walk into chat purse first, boom gak gak gak gak
[3:07:41] MobBecerra1933: Moment of truth: Trundle will be banned ?
[3:07:45] TheTragicomical: I'm an LPL noob, I just know that their meta is Alien and bizarre WutFace
[3:07:57] RustyTheCaster: it should be, looper is playing xD
[3:07:59] TheTragicomical: For instance, no Trundle ban so far NotLikeThis
[3:08:10] RustyTheCaster: everyone is banning from star players
[3:08:15] AI_Logic: Nah, the meta here is similar to the rest of the world
[3:08:36] MobBecerra1933: So it begins
[3:08:37] AngieFoxtrot: Rusty, are LGD going to come back to form or are the going to keep toying with our emotions like last split?
[3:08:39] TheTragicomical: Ah. Specific bans for star players. The usual. Yet... I hope Trundle is at leas tpicked away.
[3:08:47] shanks_will: Mata pick a thresh is GG
[3:08:48] RustyTheCaster: haha, LGD.
[3:09:07] AI_Logic: Rookie Jayce Kappa
[3:09:07] RustyTheCaster: Honestly I hope they do come back into form, but my emotions are dead when it comes to that team.
[3:09:11] TheTragicomical: Illaoi? PogChamp
[3:09:14] MobBecerra1933: Riven is too nerfed in the current meta
[3:09:20] AngieFoxtrot: Been burnt too many times Rusty?
[3:09:21] ChaoS2751: do it
[3:09:29] TheTragicomical: RIP Riven, you fighting game character, you BibleThump
[3:09:29] RustyTheCaster: I live in a fire pit with LGD
[3:09:35] Maned__Wolf: Sucks being a LGD fan!
[3:09:43] TheTragicomical: Illaoi Illaoi Illaoi PogChamp DO IT SMOrc
[3:09:52] AngieFoxtrot: Well at least thats warmer than the current temp in Sydney :P
[3:09:56] TheTragicomical: NOooo! Pick Illaoi! SMOrc
[3:09:59] RustyTheCaster: that's entirely true.
[3:10:06] MobBecerra1933: Pls bring the hentai priestess!
[3:10:16] RustyTheCaster: LGD's media manager was kind enough to give me a jersey, which is rad. So I became a fan of them
[3:10:20] jarvitz: @Rustythecaster opinions on our hero SOFM?
[3:10:21] RustyTheCaster: and from that moment they lost everything, ever.
[3:10:29] TheTragicomical: Both the hentai princess and one of the only unique looking ladies in the game besides Annie, Rek'sai, and Lamb
[3:10:30] psych0fant: lol Rusty
[3:10:32] AngieFoxtrot: Caster curse, clearly Kappa
[3:10:37] Maned__Wolf: How is Rain doing this split? havent watched much LPL
[3:10:53] RustyTheCaster: so now i'm impartial towards them. SofM is a great player, but he has weaknesses
[3:10:56] TheTragicomical: Every other girl in league is actually, going to let you in on a secret, same character with different eyes and hair PogChamp
[3:10:59] psych0fant: Don't worry LGD are sandbagging Kappa
[3:11:00] felix1srmix: not very well
[3:11:09] RustyTheCaster: Rain is doing better this split compared to last for what it's worth @Lyumii
[3:11:11] shanks_will: Thresh OMG
[3:11:16] TheTragicomical: Oh and Taliyah, now
[3:11:23] ijaysun: HP support RNG?
[3:11:32] jarvitz: WHY THE HELL IS MY GARAGE DOOR OPENING AT 3:41AM????? DO I CALL COPS?
[3:11:32] psych0fant: I'm so disappointed with RNG, I thought they would stomp EDG
[3:11:32] shanks_will: yeah
[3:11:43] psych0fant: FeelsBadMan
[3:12:00] AI_Logic: Does SofM speak mandarin?
[3:12:02] ChaoS2751: so one jersey bribed u Kappa
[3:12:04] TheTragicomical: Welp. ResidentSleeper Proving once again that playing to win is boring as fuck. Thank you competitive league.
[3:12:15] TheTragicomical: Varus? PogChamp
[3:12:20] MobBecerra1933: Now every champ created must be sexually correct
[3:12:28] AngieFoxtrot: Still more entertaining than a Jin Air game
[3:12:34] MobBecerra1933: WHERE IS MY TRUNDLE ?
[3:12:48] shanks_will: Aurelion ? Kappa
[3:13:07] MobBecerra1933: Not again
[3:13:09] TheTragicomical: I don't want sexual correctness I want UNIQUENESS. The philosphy of "pretty face, hot bod, same face, same bod" got so goddamn old. Illaoi is SUCH a good step in the right direction. ( Kappa )
[3:13:16] teamnodignity: did NB 2-0?
[3:13:28] AngieFoxtrot: Yea teamnodignity
[3:13:34] TheTragicomical: (gettit, cuze movement and motion Kappa )
[3:13:40] AI_Logic: @Thetragicomical Watch doto if you want champion diversity DendiFace Kappa
[3:13:54] TheTragicomical: I have gripes about Dota's champ design actually.
[3:14:12] TheTragicomical: It looks... I don't know the word. It's not bad it's...
[3:14:15] teamnodignity: Same, not enough boobs Kreygasm
[3:14:19] MobBecerra1933: Illaoi an Taliyah are perfect examples of uniqueness in female champs, the others are....... quite the same in base model
[3:14:26] gaton3: GRILLS
[3:14:30] TheTragicomical: @MobBecerra1933 Absofuckinlutely
[3:14:43] ijaysun: rookie !!!!
[3:14:54] 삼도천심해어: TTours
[3:14:57] TheTragicomical: Of course, Lamb on a technicality and Rek'sai because she's the momma void antlion.
[3:15:12] jarvitz: @Mobbecerra1933 its cuz when the game was newer they needed hot girls to attract people, but now they dont need them as much
[3:15:37] TheTragicomical: Relying on sex appeal to market your game makes you no better than those shitty F2P games with the boob adv- Wait. Kappa
[3:15:47] jarvitz: Kappa
[3:15:47] MobBecerra1933: 2010 mew champs: kata, miss fortune, ahri, etc
[3:16:00] AI_Logic: Annoying spirit Nami Kreygasm
[3:16:13] 삼도천심해어: garen adc Kreygasm
[3:16:29] TheTragicomical: MF, Ahri, and Elise are the only 3 champs I will accept their overly sexualized design for. Maybe Casseopeia due to the whole medusa thing.
[3:17:02] TheTragicomical: Ahri needs for fur on her near naked armor meant for FRIGID ICY TEMPERATURES. Sejuani needs to eat something, ANYTHING.
[3:17:06] jarvitz: why? cuz lore?
[3:17:17] cryptea: isn't ahri suppose to be like that tho.. lore an all
[3:17:31] teamnodignity: @TheTragicomical, The difference is that League is free though, in-game strength is not proportional to sexualised armour
[3:17:34] TheTragicomical: I'm saying they're okay to look like that. Ahri, MF, and Elise are seductresses.
[3:17:38] RustyTheCaster: sivir is amazonian i can feel that
[3:17:45] ijaysun: ez
[3:17:51] TheTragicomical: Sivir is fine, she's Xena. Basic, simple.
[3:18:10] jarvitz: what about taric, is he too sexy?
[3:18:14] TheTragicomical: @teamnodignity No but having some goddamn dignity and class when it comes to character design sure is nice. OpieOP
[3:18:30] dragonboy122: all champions should be as much sexualized as possible
[3:18:32] TheTragicomical: Taric's shtick is beauty. He's fine.
[3:18:33] MobBecerra1933: ironically, ahri, elise and cassiopeia are half humans and semi-mythological beigns. Thats why their sexuallized designs are okay for almost everyone
[3:18:53] jarvitz: and nidalee too?
[3:19:03] TheTragicomical: Nidalee is fine too, actually
[3:19:17] jarvitz: tragic who are you not fine with :/
[3:19:31] TheTragicomical: I am not fine with Sejuani and Kayle. Establishing that now.
[3:19:38] RustyTheCaster: rumble is oversexualised tbh Keepo
[3:19:47] cryochamber710: Urgot it
[3:19:49] jarvitz: sej's legs are broken
[3:20:02] teamnodignity: @TheTragicomical, Compared to other games I think it's totally fine though, most players play champions to win anyway, but those who enjoy females can also buy whatever skins they want
[3:20:04] MobBecerra1933: But katarina, lux, riven, maybe ashe are (as someone said before) the same *** model but with different eyes, skin color and hair
[3:20:07] 삼도천심해어: teemo Kreygasm
[3:20:23] jarvitz: lol
[3:20:38] leswegjuice: Nurse Akali Kreygasm
[3:20:51] Uzas: watching a league stream whilst playing dota...
[3:20:52] TheTragicomical: @MobBecerra1933 That was me. @teamnodignity Oh they can buy what skins they want, but Riot puts emphasis on how much they design their characters to fit their theme. Do you see an issue with this when you see Ashe with bare skin showing?
[3:21:02] jarvitz: rusty if you had to date any champion who would it be and why is it rek'sai?
[3:21:02] dragonboy122: what patch?
[3:21:09] 삼도천심해어: 4.20
[3:21:11] AI_Logic: @Thetragicomical In a world created by our imaginations you would make most characters aesthetically pleasing, it just makes for a more enjoyable experience and matches human standard on what we think looks good
[3:21:33] TheTragicomical: It's just not immersive at all when you realize Ashe probably gets frequent frostburns and frostbite due to her thighs showing 24/7
[3:21:42] 冷凍庫: the game isnt supposed to be on for 10 min DansGame

[3:24:19] nothingishappening: secret weapon Kappa
[3:24:24] teamnodignity: @TheTragicomical, Although in the end, I think people who dislike the fanservice (such as females) probably just ignore it, people care about gameplay over character models, it's not like your character is extremely big with skin visible
[3:24:27] jarvitz: @Rustythecaster describe @Rustythecaster in one word
[3:24:31] RustyTheCaster: there is literally no other reason for Tabe to be in this team other than shotcalling

[3:26:07] TheTragicomical: @teamnodignity Oh I realize, people buy skins for the splashes almost entirely. I just don't like Riot's hypocracy on the matter of design philosophies they've ALWAYS had. I guess they're a "small indie game company" though. Kappa

[3:28:20] TheTragicomical: @teamnodignity They talk about their design philosophies SO damn much when it comes to character creation and the image fitting the theme. Not even skins, but base looks. It all has to synergize, look, lore, abilities, and theme.
[3:28:32] Jiml0rd: #iGWIN

[3:29:28] teamnodignity: @TheTragicomical, Ah, then i understand your beef with the Ashe design but she was like one of the first champions so. I imagine they wanted to make all champions markettable at first
[3:29:28] MobBecerra1933: dumbledoge > mata
