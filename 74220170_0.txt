[3:25:24] fille422: well thats not to bad tbh. you can watch everything in hd and so on
[3:26:02] GusPlus: yeah, like I said it's not awful, but it's unstable since it's not fiber. I was on a fiber network a few years ago that was 50/50, and even without that much more speed it was beautiful due to stability.
