[2:59:57] valkyrie_god: @CasterFroskurinn Is it safe to say that EDG is currently the best team in the LPL right now?
[3:00:03] MrMatthewdee: isnt it seen as disrespectful

[3:19:57] valkyrie_god: is team fighting is more reliable, pawn can either be brilliant or completely throw games sometimes

[3:20:46] CasterFroskurinn: @rixku I think EDG have been very experimental with their drafts. They've run a lot of different compositions and different power points. I doubt they would give away a tough pick back to back off a loss.

[3:23:18] rixku: @CasterFroskurinn so you think they are giving the picks away/ not banning them on purpose? Then why dont think try out comps involving swain or vlad?
[3:23:24] tintin996: I don't know why they pay for Uzi so much he is just an ad

[3:23:58] innu2919: song name?
[3:23:59] CasterFroskurinn: @rixku I think they are, and trying to find counter picks or pushing different power points on the map. Like trying to use skarner to deny hecarim engagements
[3:24:00] GNARGNARHEAD: oooozy
[3:24:24] innu2919: we need song name
[3:24:36] valkyrie_god: @CasterFroskurinn How do u think the LPL stacks up currently with the other regions?
[3:24:37] emryx: oooozzziiii
[3:24:48] GNARGNARHEAD: don't stop believing - @innu2919
[3:25:12] innu2919: :O
[3:25:15] CasterFroskurinn: I think NA has a lot of really cool drafts. And LCK still the cleanest macro. But no one teamfights or skirmishes like the LPL.
[3:25:26] CasterFroskurinn: But I agree more with NA drafts than LPL currently.
[3:25:31] eat_a__snickers: let's get destroyed FeelsBadMan
[3:25:35] tintin996: When will cheap team likes SS meet VG ?

[3:27:22] CasterFroskurinn: It's a compression issue that's very expensive to fix. But we're working on it.
[3:27:43] GNARGNARHEAD: :O I just realised, I have steam downloading at full pelt, an the stream is running great :D
[3:27:48] Hicone1975: Which team do u guys think can win LPL summer split?

[3:28:12] yourfavnostril: EDG
[3:28:12] valkyrie_god: @Hicone1975 but it'll be close with RNG
[3:28:15] innu2919: LGD 2-1
[3:28:17] CasterFroskurinn: The stream has gotten so much better since we started. It hardly ever goes down these days. Looks much better in saturation. We just need to clean up the audio and push it to 1080 - all on the radar.
[3:28:33] thixotrofic: Jeez 3AM Twitch chat is really high quality.
[3:28:35] CasterFroskurinn: But we are aware and want to get it to the best level.

[3:33:34] AeroZara: I'm an EDG fan, but personally 4th best team in the world
[3:34:07] valkyrie_god: @AeroZara who's the other 3?
[3:34:10] innu2919: @xclxlc http://tga.plu.cn/ http://www.douyu.com/ http://www.zhanqi.tv/
[3:34:11] CasterFroskurinn: @AeroZara Hard to say since I havent watched much EU. Not better than Korea's elite. Would be a strong match against NA. I think NA draft's better, but still doesn't fight as well.
[3:34:18] warl0rdggg: <-----jhin main he my new draven
[3:34:19] AeroZara: atm i feel TSM is 5th best in the world, ROX is 1st Jin Air is 2nd and SKT is 3rd
[3:34:39] AeroZara: @CasterFroskurinn fair enough
[3:34:43] innu2919: @xclxlc hey deleted link
[3:34:45] valkyrie_god: @CasterFroskurinn EU is weaker than NA right now imo
[3:35:18] emryx: Season 5 never forget
[3:35:34] CasterFroskurinn: Like we're still obsessed with Ekko right now when I think Shen should be experimented with more.
[3:35:40] reserves_: NA 4Head
[3:35:48] aacr0n: EU has a weird *** super slow playstyle that always holds up well internationally
[3:35:55] CasterFroskurinn: ^^^
[3:36:10] AeroZara: @CasterFroskurinn Surprised Jax isn't played more in China
[3:36:14] CasterFroskurinn: That's why I think WE would actually do really well internationally, but not domestically. Very patient style.
[3:36:17] GNARGNARHEAD: you gotta be pretty swarve to pull of a bowl cut
[3:36:17] emryx: except G2-8
[3:36:20] reserves_: truly do feel bad when ppl say ANY na team could beat EDG/SKT its truly sad so inconsistent
[3:36:55] CasterFroskurinn: @Reserves_ I think EDG could get outdrafted right now. Which gives them skewed matchups
[3:37:02] valkyrie_god: NA is looking really strong right now, but against the likes of top tier LPL and LCK is different
[3:37:02] aacr0n: If TSM keeps up the pace they might have a decent shot for the finals, Fnatic is looking scary.. i haven't watched enough asian games :(
[3:37:02] innu2919: @xclxlc China has 90 million people a user LUL.
[3:37:05] AeroZara: @Reserves_ I think current TSM can, if they dont tilt to the fact they are playing those teams, like most teams do when they face those teams
