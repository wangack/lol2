[2:09:15] bulletnt: Bringing up past achievements or lack of achievements is honestly one of the dumbest thing anyone could do. Meta shifts, roster changes, as well as just teams improving or slumping are bigger factors than what that team did last Worlds.
[2:09:23] KreyGamer: @fluxz0r17, Rox and SKT would have a field day with such mistakes, literally close the game in next 10 min if they were in Imay position 6 min ago\
