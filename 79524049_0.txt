[3:05:30] Cara4lyfe: 5vs0
[3:05:35] Granattta_slim: Mata is Korean no?

[3:05:45] Cara4lyfe: @granattta_slim yeeeee
[3:05:47] Yujulobster: top 3 Mata meiko zero

[3:05:56] Cara4lyfe: WEEEEEEEEEE
[3:06:02] Nikl6: mlxg best jungler

[3:06:13] iamxfallen: Kreygasm
[3:06:18] tr4dy: Mata is a GOD
[3:06:28] Granattta_slim: With what? Soraka?

[3:07:37] iamxfallen: g2 Kappa honestly trick makes the team
[3:07:56] Cara4lyfe: GG
[3:07:57] Granattta_slim: The Koo Tigers or rather, Rox Tigers are the undisputed creators of meta picks. Other teams may perfect them but they're the ones who play it. What other team would pull out something like malphite?
[3:07:57] Yujulobster: G2 Top 5 botlane LUL
[3:07:59] goblinguy01: G2 so good. Lost EU the world's spot Kappa

[3:09:49] Cara4lyfe: WEEEEEEEE
[3:09:58] yBeastification: Honestly the difference between the top 4 teams right now isn't that big imo
[3:10:06] Cara4lyfe: @ascrilas Teeto is better
[3:10:15] Joshtheninja77: WE RNG Imay and edg are top 4?
[3:10:18] 2becontinued: @ybeastification EDG is way better than everyone else though
[3:10:28] iamxfallen: I hope we get to see Scout vs Bjerg at worlds Kregasm
[3:10:30] yBeastification: I mean globally
[3:10:42] yBeastification: SKT Rox and EDG/RNG
[3:10:42] Cara4lyfe: Remember when EDG lost to LGD
[3:10:52] NaViN11: This should be the most competitive worlds ever IMO
[3:11:03] 2becontinued: Cant wait for ESPN to put TSM as Number 1 in their global power rankings next week Kappa
[3:11:07] Granattta_slim: I feel like the Whole of LCS is similar to NBA. Everyone is fighting for second place and the right to get smashed by SKT/GS Cavs
[3:11:20] Joshtheninja77: @ascrilas, SKT? LUL you mean afreeca
[3:11:27] yBeastification: SKT aren't godlike like last season though
[3:11:40] Joshtheninja77: Afreeca > SKT TriHard
[3:11:42] JOEHOGE: imo this worlds will be hyphy af
[3:11:44] Ryboiii: SKT would've been fine if they kept Marin
[3:11:50] 2becontinued: Fionn has actually turned into a delusional NA fanboy. Idk what happened to him
[3:11:56] iamxfallen: I would agree Skt are top if they can replace Blank BibleThump
[3:11:59] 삼도천심해어: SKT Marin Kreygasm LGD Marin BrokeBack
[3:12:06] 2becontinued: I used to love his articles when he was with theScore
[3:12:08] Ryboiii: Money
[3:12:08] goblinguy01: @iamxfallen They have Bengi
[3:12:13] iamxfallen: Skt Dandy Pls
[3:12:14] yBeastification: Even when SKT win they don't look as good as they were when winning games last season
[3:12:17] Joshtheninja77: $$$ OpieOP
[3:12:18] NaViN11: Marin left for $$$$
[3:12:28] yBeastification: Dismantling teams with no chance for counter play
[3:12:33] Joshtheninja77: Money and recognition
[3:12:35] goblinguy01: SKT Dandy and Mata Kappa
[3:12:38] Cara4lyfe: Actually $$$
[3:12:42] iamxfallen: yeah but they want Blank to be their main jungler
[3:12:51] Ryboiii: The thing is, Marin was a bad top laner before SKT
[3:12:51] Cara4lyfe: Actually ¥
[3:12:52] yBeastification: Completely outplaying teams just by map movement
[3:12:52] Granattta_slim: Yes please. Let's just Fuse Samsumg and SKT
[3:13:00] 삼도천심해어: Bang best ADC in the world LUL
[3:13:13] iamxfallen: Ambition wouldn't be too bad on Skt
[3:13:19] yBeastification: Deft is in current form imo
[3:13:20] NaViN11: Deft best ADC world
[3:13:22] goblinguy01: Fuse Team WE and EDG. Clearlove in S2 World Elite :)
[3:13:26] Joshtheninja77: Marin wanted to be known as an extremely good top laner and not in fakers shadow... and $$$ OpieOP
[3:13:36] Cara4lyfe: I like Sneaky better
[3:13:39] Ryboiii: Tbh Mystic is the best ADC
[3:13:41] 2becontinued: I think SKT needs a jungler that isn't overly aggressive
[3:13:48] Granattta_slim: That's the thing with stuff like Lane swapping. I feel like these western strategies to try and match the mechanical skill of the Koreans. And it still comes back to bite them in the ***
[3:13:51] Ryboiii: Kappa
[3:13:52] ChaoS2751: Splasssshhhh
[3:13:54] 2becontinued: and not utter garbage (blank)
[3:13:57] yBeastification: I disagree if SKT had peanut
[3:13:59] Joshtheninja77: Afreeca freaks > SKT TriHard
[3:13:59] 삼도천심해어: blank should go back to china Kappa
[3:14:00] iamxfallen: Mystic is pretty good, hard to decide between mystic and Uzi
[3:14:06] goblinguy01: They can get Dandy or Kakao out of Lpsl prison
[3:14:25] Ryboiii: TSM in their current state should be able to reach Semis
[3:14:35] Ryboiii: Pretty dominantly
[3:14:37] yBeastification: Idk I think it's EDG's year honestly
[3:14:39] iamxfallen: Skt needs an agressive jungler but Blank decisions NotLikeThis
[3:14:42] Granattta_slim: I was so sad that Koo lost las year. I coils go for Koo tiger skins.
[3:14:44] Joshtheninja77: And europe will take a vacation LUL
[3:14:47] 2becontinued: Blank looks average even in SKT's wins. He does not belong in the LCK.
[3:15:00] 삼도천심해어: WE Spirit LUL
[3:15:04] goblinguy01: Yes. Get KaKao or Dandy
[3:15:11] 2becontinued: @makedonski88 2014.
[3:15:13] Joshtheninja77: WE Spirit FeelsBadMan
[3:15:23] yBeastification: He belongs in the LCK just not on SKT if SKT had Score or something they'd be incredible
[3:15:24] Ryboiii: Spirit was way better in WE compared to in FNC
[3:15:24] Granattta_slim: I can already imagine the Koo Tigers Victor. Ashe and firoa skins
[3:15:27] 2becontinued: @goblibguy01 Kakao is playing very badly right now in LPL
[3:15:33] iamxfallen: Bless wouldn't be a bad add either
[3:15:34] JOEHOGE: skt in season 4 4Head
[3:15:43] goblinguy01: Isn't KaKao benched in LspL
[3:15:45] NaViN11: I wouldn't be shocked if SKT reached out to Reignover at the end of the year
[3:15:51] 2becontinued: I think it would be cool if SKT got rush
[3:15:56] Joshtheninja77: I think SKT need vasilii LUL
[3:15:57] btfl_: same 10 champs every. single. game.
[3:15:59] Ryboiii: I don't think Reignover would leave NA, he seems pretty happy right now
[3:16:14] Ryboiii: Unless IMT throw super hard
[3:16:18] 2becontinued: So many good junglers they can get. If they keep blank im gonna stop being an SKT fan
[3:16:21] yBeastification: Imagine SKT reign over and huni Kreygasm
[3:16:27] Gyunol: when Fnatic make final at IEM we in EU think G2 is best team after SKT but ... Because of that not say TSM can make semis
[3:16:32] ChillingHere: ᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚ ᅚᅚᅚᅚ ᅚᅚᅚᅚ BuddhaBar SmoocherZ KevinTurtle ᅚ ᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚ ᅚᅚ ᅚᅚ ᅚᅚ TooSpicy ᅚᅚ ᅚ ᅚ ᅚ WholeWheat ᅚᅚ ᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚ PogChamp ᅚ ᅚ KappaPride ᅚᅚ KappaRoss ᅚᅚ ᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚ DansGame ᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚ cmonBruh ᅚᅚᅚᅚ ᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚᅚ DatSheffy Kreygasm WutFace

[3:16:33] iamxfallen: that would be op
[3:16:45] 삼도천심해어: after gamsu left, spirit is becoming worse BrokeBack
[3:16:47] iamxfallen: Skt Huhi and Reignover
[3:16:48] Ryboiii: SKT with Huni and Reign would basically be IMT except better map knowledge
[3:17:06] goblinguy01: SKT Clearlove and Flandre
[3:17:12] Granattta_slim: Oh god, clearlove would gurante worlds
[3:17:15] innu2919: OMG Kreygasm 1-12 trash team RaccAttack
[3:17:27] yBeastification: It would make SKT the clear best team in the world (if they adapted)
[3:17:33] iamxfallen: Mlxg would be cool. I prefer Dandy to go back to Lck tho Skt Dandy Pls BibleThump
[3:17:42] goblinguy01: Clearlove could carry Ekko Fox
[3:17:47] 2becontinued: Honestly I hope that rumour about Mata to SKT is true
[3:17:53] Ryboiii: I want Samsung White to come back
[3:18:01] Joshtheninja77: ^
[3:18:02] iamxfallen: Wolf isn't bad though
[3:18:09] 2becontinued: Wolf is good but Mata is Kreygasm
[3:18:14] Granattta_slim: AHAHAHAHAH. Froggen can't even carry that team of boosted Monkeys. What makes clearlove a better pick for them
[3:18:19] goblinguy01: Wolf Is worse than Meiko, Zero and Mata
[3:18:23] yBeastification: Clearlove would Kha 2v8 with Froggen in NA 4Head
[3:18:28] Ryboiii: Why do people have so much hate on Wolf
[3:18:28] NaViN11: Wolf is really good. Wouldn't think that is fair to him
[3:18:30] PoliticalMuffin: ^
[3:18:41] 2becontinued: @goblibguy01 Zero? He's better than Zero.
[3:18:43] Gyunol: but worlds will be in NA
[3:19:06] 2becontinued: @goblibguy01 You mention Zero but not Gorilla? You need to watch some LCK man
[3:19:08] yBeastification: Actually you don't notice the synergy much
[3:19:10] Granattta_slim: Where is worlds at in NA. It's not going to Montreal is it?
[3:19:19] yBeastification: Look at Meiko deft
[3:19:19] ChaoS2751: Maybe he should start diet Kappa
[3:19:20] iamxfallen: Skt bot lane isn't the problem
[3:19:20] Ryboiii: Its in San Diego I think
[3:19:27] goblinguy01: Clearlove and Froggen could carry Ekko Fox Kappa
[3:19:30] iamxfallen: its Blank and Duke is Meh
[3:19:31] Ryboiii: or like San Francisco
[3:19:33] 2becontinued: Yea probably just change jungle, skt dont need mata
[3:19:35] Gyunol: no only in NA
[3:19:35] yBeastification: That's synergy imo
[3:19:52] kappa25072001: TPA Shen Kreygasm
[3:19:55] 2becontinued: And duke is fine too. Not amazing this year but hes been good
[3:19:57] goblinguy01: Jungle Notcurne and mid Kha
[3:20:07] NaViN11: Duke is meh? Duke is good but lacks the jungle help
[3:20:08] Granattta_slim: I think you would need an actual crane to carry a team like Fox. Or Micheal Jordan since Rick fox is no match
[3:20:20] NaViN11: It's all jungle for SKT
[3:20:20] Cara4lyfe: Nice flash Kappa
[3:20:21] Joshtheninja77: SKT needs a different mid Kappa skt goldV
[3:20:28] Ryboiii: The only reason SKT was so good last year was because Bengi had so much Map Presence
[3:20:32] ChaoS2751: EZ
[3:20:33] innu2919: 0-6 4Head
[3:20:35] Gyunol: flash in straight line ...

[3:20:55] yBeastification: Agreed bengi unsung hero of SKT last year
[3:21:04] whaleOwO: perfect game ?
[3:21:11] goblinguy01: Bengi is so good. People think he's average
[3:21:12] 2becontinued: Bengi is a great player he just needs to expand his champion pool.
[3:21:18] TheFurioso: patch 6.13 or 6.14?
[3:21:19] Ryboiii: Even when he had 2 worlds wins, people only remembered faker and it was kinda sad
[3:21:20] iamxfallen: Well Most Skt losses have been on Blank Lmao
[3:21:24] Granattta_slim: Who has the most diverse Support pool? Gorilla or Zero?
[3:21:32] Ryboiii: Prob Gorilla
[3:21:39] yBeastification: Zero buy gorillla is better
[3:21:42] goblinguy01: Didn't Piglet and Pooh carry SKT in s3 anyways
[3:21:47] iamxfallen: Aphromoo Kappa
[3:21:55] NaViN11: Piglets Vayne carried
[3:22:05] 2becontinued: Faker and Piglet carried
[3:22:11] NaViN11: His vayne was unreal
[3:22:18] Yujulobster: Piglet carry C9C with Rammus Kappa
[3:22:18] iamxfallen: Piglet vayne/ez/cait Kreygasm
[3:22:20] goblinguy01: Piglet gets called trash when he was one of the main reasons they won BibleThump
[3:22:22] Granattta_slim: Hey remeber that game where Piglet picked Rammus Kappa
[3:22:22] yBeastification: So was his Ezreal tbh
[3:22:35] iamxfallen: Rammus supp Lul
[3:22:36] Valkaisu: piglet was so *** good
[3:22:41] 2becontinued: Piglet come back to Korea please, his talent is wasted on TLA
[3:22:44] Ryboiii: Its forgotten mostly becauses hes so unimpactful this split
[3:22:46] yBeastification: Yeah I kinda miss xorki being meta honestly
[3:22:53] whaleOwO: no perfect game :(
[3:23:06] iamxfallen: we will see a lot of corkid in Worlds
[3:23:06] Gyunol: RIP Perfect Game
[3:23:07] Ryboiii: His play has been mediocre and his team synergy is lacking
[3:23:08] Aruns19: Report mystic for feeding
[3:23:09] Granattta_slim: Hey man. If I see Graves in ADC again, I'll be happy with that.
[3:23:15] goblinguy01: Just like S2 Bebe. His Vayne Kreygasm
[3:23:19] NaViN11: Corki is still really good but just spikes later and not as hard
[3:23:19] iamxfallen: the new corki build Kreygasm
[3:23:28] 2becontinued: @ybeastification Fury played corki yesterday. He did really well
[3:23:32] iamxfallen: Gunblade/triforce
[3:23:55] goblinguy01: PDD Rumble :D
[3:24:02] 2becontinued: Triforce Gunblade Duskblade the build had so much birst
[3:24:11] yBeastification: Yeah I play Corki myself now and then but after the tri force changes its really shitty on him no big crits hurt him
[3:24:38] 2becontinued: @ascrilas I think they gave it to Faker didn't they? That's what it says on his esportswikis page.
[3:24:52] Ryboiii: Faker is a giant meme at this point
[3:24:56] NaViN11: Yes but if you build Tri to essence to IE to void. He's still really strong
[3:24:59] Granattta_slim: Hey man. I'm seeing Kog ma being played again, maybe we'll start to see corki again too
[3:25:31] 2becontinued: I love the adc meta rn. Every adc is strong except trist corki and vayne
[3:25:32] yBeastification: Yeah but Corki used to be good and strong because of his spike after tri force / sorc
[3:25:51] Gyunol: and kalista sucks
[3:25:55] yBeastification: Haven't tried the armour pen build so I can't speak on it but I'll try it today
[3:25:57] Granattta_slim: It's not season 2 ADC super meta though
[3:26:11] Granattta_slim: AAH the days where I can one shot a fed Olaf
[3:26:20] goblinguy01: @granattta_slim Isn't that why TPA won anyways
[3:26:36] yBeastification: I think MF could see play if it was t for jhib
[3:26:51] Granattta_slim: True
[3:26:52] yBeastification: Jhin is basically and better MF
[3:27:13] Granattta_slim: I always think he's a better Caitlyn
[3:27:25] Joshtheninja77: LPL LUL
[3:28:02] goblinguy01: Please win Team WE. We want to see Dandy and Easyhoon lose to Chinese SSW
[3:28:12] kappa25072001: Ok 6300 ip adc champ > 3150 ip champ of course and he is the new champ too
[3:28:33] Granattta_slim: Tell that to imp.
[3:29:09] Gyunol: Ashe and Sivir 450 ip adc and the best now
[3:29:24] kappa25072001: And you pay 450 ip to buy Jared ( Annie) and her tibber gonna rekt all your team until u die mother fuc ker
[3:29:30] yBeastification: Yeah that's illogical the ip doesn't show how good a champ is lmao
[3:29:40] iamxfallen: jhin is pretty good but sivir/kog prob better team fighters, same with mf if theycangeta nice set up which is pretty hard in competitive
[3:29:47] goblinguy01: Pro picks aren't normal people
