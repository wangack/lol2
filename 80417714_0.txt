[4:57:12] Optyfenx: @RUSTYTheCASTER, who do you think will be the 3th team to go to worlds from china?

[4:58:36] mythonline: @RUSTYTheCASTER to be fair, they deserved what happened in worlds... EDG had to play the LSPL to find teams that will scrim seriously against them, so many pro's getting lazy

[4:59:47] mythonline: @RUSTYTheCASTER I wasn't giving excuses or blaming them, I didn't follow LPL this year so much and I just hope they changed this attitude
[4:59:47] RustyTheCaster: I think he might be, Peanut is pretty beast
[5:00:01] haHAA_EU_haHAA: China gets absolutely annihilated again by Team USA 107-57 in second Rio warm-up TriHard
