[1:13:28] elcab0ng: ks lul
[1:13:31] MaterialBurst00: lol
[1:13:33] tostitos25: Out of everyone in the Ssw and Ssb roster only Deft and Meiko prospered really
[1:13:35] evloen: i feel bad for all korean imports, because the communication sucks
[1:13:42] Granattta_slim: Filthy support ks

[1:14:01] tostitos25: No but really
[1:14:12] CovertRaccoon: LUL P LUL
[1:14:13] Granattta_slim: Is it racist to say that all Korean players look no older than 20?
[1:14:22] tostitos25: Only Deft prospered
[1:14:27] Falscherfux93: no it isnt
[1:14:29] jamalala: forgive @davylsonn he's just saying random things
[1:14:30] AoiiKitsune: mata kinda?
[1:14:31] elcab0ng: eternal 20 yo

[1:14:39] mikehuoston: most of thema re around 20 so it makes sense
[1:14:46] Falscherfux93: x)
[1:14:51] tostitos25: Faker will be 20 soon
[1:14:52] 삼도천심해어: pawN is 19 Kappa
[1:14:54] Falscherfux93: im on cocain
[1:15:03] tostitos25: I'm like a month older than Faker
[1:15:11] mikehuoston: i dont need drugs to be happy Kappa
[1:15:16] tostitos25: And he's the best player in the world
[1:15:23] jamalala: @davylsonn brtt kicked your mom in the junk and *** on her chest
[1:15:28] Falscherfux93: who says we take them to be happy xd
[1:15:29] MaterialBurst00: Faker will probably go to China next year. I wonder how much will they pay him.
[1:15:29] tostitos25: I'm the best player in my house kappa
[1:15:31] Granattta_slim: Anyone else think it'd be cool if Rick Fox took over as a player for Echo fox Kappa
[1:15:37] thdtndus1227: 사스가 다음의아들 김치민!! 승강전 청부사 김치민 화이팅이다 이기야

[1:15:59] AoiiKitsune: he gets mad money anyways from endorsement deals
[1:16:07] AoiiKitsune: he doesnt need to go to a chinese team
[1:16:13] davylsonn: IM VERY RICH TODAY
[1:16:17] tostitos25: And he wins everything at Skt
[1:16:24] MaterialBurst00: He deserves to get Rich in China, atleast for a year.
[1:16:27] davylsonn: IN RIO
[1:16:30] jamalala: lel Rick Fox wasn't all that good at his best sport so...
[1:16:38] evloen: faker gets a lot of money already
[1:16:39] thdtndus1227: Chimin was SKT sub jg
[1:16:48] AoiiKitsune: he is getting a lot of chinese money though, from doing ads etc
[1:16:49] Granattta_slim: Tomarrow. It's Rick Fox vs Shaq. Lol
[1:16:49] tostitos25: @call_me_b_ he gets a lot of money at Skt
[1:17:14] tostitos25: I think Shaq was the better player lol
[1:17:16] hirtza1: faker doesnt get *** from doing ads
[1:17:26] AoiiKitsune: ummm he gets a lot
[1:17:29] Granattta_slim: Korea must be a magical place where E sports is king
[1:17:29] hirtza1: all of it goes through skt
[1:17:31] AoiiKitsune: have you seen his chinese ads
[1:17:32] PapaSmithy: he has personal and team endorsements
[1:17:41] tostitos25: Definitely gets a lot money
[1:17:42] jamalala: Shaq was a superstar, Rick Fox at best could be called a journeyman NBA player
[1:17:44] Granattta_slim: Ayy
[1:17:47] 삼도천심해어: Papasmithy DansGame
[1:18:08] tostitos25: Bottom line is Faker won't leave to Lpl.
[1:18:18] BigBoyN8e: Ezreal ult primary wombocombo OpieOP EleGiggle 4Head FailFish
[1:18:18] FUDO_TFT: Leblanc Mejais EleGiggle
[1:18:22] tostitos25: Imports do help teams
[1:18:24] MaterialBurst00: Mark my words, he will.
[1:18:31] hirtza1: that's true @Tostitos25
[1:18:35] tostitos25: And Fnatic will make worlds
[1:18:36] mikehuoston: rick fox in the 2001 and 2002 playoffs was really valuable as a versatile forward in the triangle
[1:18:45] AoiiKitsune: are you high LUL
[1:18:47] TlMBERS: Papasmithy PogChamp
[1:19:03] mikehuoston: he spaced the floor, was a good passer so he fit the triangle, and was a great defender
[1:19:04] PoliticalMuffin: remember when GT was top 4?
[1:19:05] Granattta_slim: Yea but Shaq REWROTE the game
[1:19:08] evloen: @PapaSmithy what are your predictions regarding world's
[1:19:17] MaterialBurst00: Ill try to sleep a litttle before SS and EDG games, see ya guys.
[1:19:23] PapaSmithy: Too early to say when no data points are available for 6.15
[1:19:23] tostitos25: @granattta_slim Jordan? Kobe Bryant??
[1:19:25] mikehuoston: he's a role player, not everyone can be a star or a starter. rick fox was actually really valuable as a role player
[1:19:27] Granattta_slim: Worlds predictions are WAY too early. Last year proved that
[1:19:33] jamalala: @greatlebowski thats what you call a journeyman player
[1:19:39] mikehuoston: pretty perfect for the triangle.
[1:19:40] Granattta_slim: Jordan for sure
[1:19:48] lovework: yeah no one could have predicted SKT would win world's last year
[1:19:53] tostitos25: @granattta_slim everyone predicted Skt. And look what happened lol
[1:19:56] leodqxw: @PapaSmithy is Doa gonna cast for playoffs ? T_T
[1:19:57] AoiiKitsune: what patch will worlds be on? is it set for 6.15? or will it be a later patch
[1:20:04] ChaoS2751: 6.16
[1:20:07] evloen: nobody expected KOO to make it to the finals
[1:20:10] MaterialBurst00: Riot will try to buff NA playstyle, they are desperate for NA to be relevant at worlds.
[1:20:11] ChaoS2751: maybe？
[1:20:11] Granattta_slim: @tostitos25 not the most shocking prediction. I'm sure
[1:20:12] PapaSmithy: of course DOA will be casting in playoffs
[1:20:15] evloen: most people were expecting Fnatic/OG to go to the finals
[1:20:19] RustyTheCaster: There will be no major patches after 6.15 is all I know!
[1:20:21] tostitos25: Probably like 6.17
[1:20:28] mikehuoston: @jamalala, yeah, but there's a reason they keep getting paid. rick fox could play
[1:20:28] Granattta_slim: Yay. More Doa
[1:20:30] RustyTheCaster: So the meta that establishes itself after 6.15 should remain consistent through worlds
[1:20:32] TheVern: @papasmithy you casting worlds?
[1:20:44] leodqxw: Kreygasm
[1:20:50] hirtza1: inb4 they release that assassin rework just before worlds NotLikeThis
[1:20:59] mikehuoston: @jamalala, look at all the guys who flame out. they dont even get to be journeymen
[1:21:05] Granattta_slim: I bet papasmithe will just replace himself with a cardboard cut out
[1:21:07] Ghost_of_Dividion: @PapaSmithy, Of all the other LCK english casters who would you take with you if stranded on a remote island?
[1:21:10] AoiiKitsune: GT has been slipping quite a bit recently
[1:21:13] jamalala: I watched Rick Fox's whole career, ya im that old :/
[1:21:23] MaterialBurst00: Release Assassins if Faker goes to worlds Kreygasm
[1:21:25] jamalala: ya he was a decent player
[1:21:27] PapaSmithy: Monte has pretty good life skills
[1:21:29] Granattta_slim: How many times have I read THAT question
[1:21:30] PapaSmithy: I'd take him
[1:21:38] lovework: you can't afford monte
[1:21:38] tostitos25: I predicted Koo Tigers to go to the finals. After they 3-0d Fnatic Kappa
[1:21:44] TheVern: GT played like wusses all game FeelsBadMan
[1:21:54] PapaSmithy: I get mates rates, discount makes him a good bet
[1:22:16] lovework: the proper answer is you wouldn't take anyone with you
[1:22:22] lovework: why would you want to strand someone else, you monster
[1:22:23] Granattta_slim: So who think NA will beat groups?
[1:22:24] TheVern: @angelkill4r did you bet on GT?
[1:22:34] jamalala: @greatlebowski ya the flameout rates in the US big 3 sports is extremely high. its tough to make it out of your first contract
[1:22:55] 삼도천심해어: if saint can bet snake 1 game. they can beat gt too Kappa
[1:23:00] 삼도천심해어: beat*
[1:23:03] mikehuoston: yeah, i mean rick fox isn't some amazing person but he definitely wasn't a scrub
[1:23:05] tostitos25: @granattta_slim everyone. They're gonna get bad teams in group because Clg did so well at Msi. NA will have wildcard and Brasil teams probably
[1:23:13] CovertRaccoon: a lot of KappaPride
[1:23:20] jamalala: @greatlebowski i played baseball into AA and 95% of my teammates never touched the major leagues
[1:23:50] evloen: what do you guys think of the relegation system?
[1:23:50] jamalala: its rough
[1:23:52] tostitos25: Eu are going to get Korean and Lpl teams in groups. Eu will be lucky to go to quarters
[1:23:54] 삼도천심해어: baseball DansGame
[1:23:54] TheVern: @greatlebowski I would say in NBA history he is known as a scrub. he's just a celebrity he played for big market teams and was in movies and ***
[1:24:02] Ghost_of_Dividion: Acorn in promotion turret FeelsBadMan
[1:24:16] Granattta_slim: *** NO. If I see CLG at another international tourney I'll legit Boycott. They were an embarrassment at worlds and MSI they had NO conception before taking another beating by SK *** T
[1:24:33] Granattta_slim: Competition. *
[1:24:52] mikehuoston: @TheVern, i would say in nba history he's just a valuable role player. there were definitely other players like him. but let's not pretend a 3-D forward w/ passing and rebounding is not valuable
[1:24:53] tostitos25: @granattta_slim are you bronze
[1:25:03] evloen: wtf. clg was in the finals vs SKT at MSI
[1:25:05] jamalala: @TheVern i dont think he would be called a scrub....
[1:25:11] MoldyCalzone: gg
[1:25:13] ShrewForYou: MINIONS OP Kappa
[1:25:21] enthusedtv: DICKS OUT FOR HARAMBE Kreygasm
[1:25:27] tostitos25: @evloen I'm convinced he's not ranked or a bronze
[1:25:38] Granattta_slim: Is everyone forgoing its MSI? Is MSI anything like worlds?
[1:25:40] AoiiKitsune: game talents NotLikeThis
[1:25:45] oldzilean: LUL
[1:25:47] tostitos25: @granattta_slim yes
[1:25:51] oldzilean: fastest losses PogChamp LUL
[1:25:54] jamalala: @TheVern you dont give scrubs the ball at crunch time in playoff runs
[1:25:55] Cologner: It's out for harambe
[1:25:58] mikehuoston: @TheVern, your definition of scrub is just different from mine. i would call a scrub a dude like anthony bennet, james white, tony wroten, random dudes who flamed out and never was good enough to stick
[1:26:02] evloen: not at all tbh lol. at msi, you get an idea of who's strong, but sometimes you get an entirely different team at world's
[1:26:08] mikehuoston: were*
[1:26:16] evloen: they won MSI, but underperformed heavily at world's
[1:26:32] tostitos25: Edg
[1:26:53] Granattta_slim: I didn't get why China slum
[1:26:56] tostitos25: I mean most teams who make quarters at Msi do so in Worlds also
[1:27:09] Granattta_slim: Slumped the way they did but NA was like "how"
[1:27:19] Thecpu102: where is the TriHard caster
[1:27:35] mikehuoston: we made him quit FeelsBadMan
[1:27:37] tostitos25: I'm just here to watch Edg
[1:27:46] mikehuoston: same
[1:27:50] ChaoS2751: ^
[1:27:56] evloen: IG should be a good game too
[1:27:59] Granattta_slim: Who knows. Maybe if Darshan can somehow carry his merry band of boosted monkeys, than sure. The world finals is there for the taking.
[1:28:00] evloen: I want dandy to shine
[1:28:15] Shiraishimai: what dandy is in VG
[1:28:16] zhaotongjie: When is Na LCS playoff
[1:28:16] jamalala: im just here cuz theres nothing else to watch that has good players
[1:28:20] tostitos25: @granattta_slim lol Clg is not the best anymore
[1:28:20] evloen: on the contrary, i think CLG's bottom lane is their best bet at winning
[1:28:40] tostitos25: Good luck to NA teams trying to make it past not 1, but 3 Lck teams
[1:28:42] mikehuoston: idk dandy seems inconsistent. sometimes his engages are good, sometimes they aren't. but a lot of the time it literally just looks like his team doesnt follow up well
[1:28:42] jamalala: theres Remilia streaming, LJL and thats about it
[1:28:49] oldzilean: WutFace
[1:28:57] jamalala: oh bunnyfufu too 4Head
[1:29:06] tostitos25: Remilia is a hot ***
[1:29:09] Granattta_slim: LJL Taric must be fabulous. .
[1:29:12] zhaotongjie: I wangt to watch TSM
[1:29:12] evloen: think it's because of the language barrier?
[1:29:14] tostitos25: Idc idc
[1:29:26] evloen: he's really not washed up. the guy is still good, just like imp. just unlucky i guess
[1:29:49] evloen: i hope imp goes back to korea
[1:29:59] KingJames_____: what about the $$$$
[1:30:03] tostitos25: It will probably be Kt, Rox, and Skt in worlds again
[1:30:17] tostitos25: @evloen he won't. He's in it for the money now.
[1:30:23] BlazingHigh: I done smoked myself silly!! R.I.P to me Kreygasm
[1:30:29] Ralleezy: I'm here for the Snake
[1:30:30] KingJames_____: i believe samsung can run through the gauntlet
[1:30:32] tostitos25: @evloen he has his Worlds title
[1:30:35] Granattta_slim: It's seems that as long as Faker can stay in prime condition, worlds is basically the Plot of Afro Samurai, everyone kills each other for the pleasure of facing off #1
[1:30:39] impwannabe: GT > LGD in playoffs 4Head disgusting system
[1:30:47] oldzilean: SwiftRage \m/
[1:30:48] tostitos25: Samsung just lost to Kt, gl to them
[1:31:01] KingJames_____: their bottom side of the map is completely horribad in comparison to samsung
[1:31:02] BupropionHydrochloride: group A is so much weaker than group B...
[1:31:12] BupropionHydrochloride: I just dont get that stupid system
[1:31:15] evloen: Btw what happened to Newbee? weren't they like number 1 last split?
[1:31:15] tostitos25: @bupropionhydrochloride yep
[1:31:27] RustyTheCaster: \m/
[1:31:29] KingJames_____: but ssumday is gonna have a field day laning with cuvee
[1:31:31] tostitos25: I don't get the group system either, they all play each other

[1:31:42] BupropionHydrochloride: BibleThump GodV
[1:31:42] impwannabe: Tbh group A is like putting TSM and TL in a group with echo fox, phoenix 1, NRG and Apex
[1:31:49] Granattta_slim: My one hope for worlds is that EU Giants makes it b
[1:31:49] BlazingHigh: Bengi will lead SKT to a 3 worlds Kappa
[1:31:57] senga_kench: i love the lpl because you can actually have a conversation, unlike every other region's competitive scene
[1:32:02] evloen: why does bengi get so much hate
[1:32:02] impwannabe: And Group B is like CLG C9 Imt and so on
[1:32:03] KingJames_____: fish and raz arent mods on this stream like rusty, lol
[1:32:07] mikehuoston: @Abnf3, v true
[1:32:18] tostitos25: Why do they have group a and group b for
[1:32:22] Granattta_slim: I'll die of laughter I see giants take it to worlds. Is that just me?
[1:32:22] RustyTheCaster: They can make themselves mods, i'm not gonna show them how xD
