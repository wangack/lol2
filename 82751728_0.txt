[1:48:44] FishRoeSoup: monte is known for not playing at all though

[1:51:19] mikehuoston: things like teamfighting and mechanics are things that make rank relevant. macro strategy is something that can definitely be comprehensively studied.
[1:51:20] Granattta_slim: Lee sin. Is it a monk or a French man who has sin?
[1:51:20] qwer12345: Game talent already won 3-2
