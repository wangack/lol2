[4:47:34] Sadwannabecloudvolcano: @shinamon345, Most casters have bias. Honestly, pretty much all of them do. They are fans just like we are and have teams that are their favorite
[4:47:38] HoochFighter: @kelsi_monroe And criminals Keepo
[4:47:40] majishinnnn: @Superkell SKT did amazing by stalling out even when behind. Honestly they played well.. but.. they had *** early games and could never get leads. Also blank was terrible

[7:51:18] Narokuu: I just hate how people fight over EU and NA. and other regions, let them all play. If a palyer goes to another region they have reason. Cheer for your team. and hope they do good
[7:51:26] burnsid5q7: skt will still go to worlds
[7:51:41] 2becontinued: @crocorite That's bad logic. What if the difference between top 2 and not top 2 is really small? What if team play is more important than individual skill?
[7:51:47] Narokuu: @ShameLezzDK They play in NA, stop callign them EU palyers, they came to NA bcuse they make more moeny and can do better. dont get mad.

[7:54:29] 2becontinued: @seongpum Even when SKT were on a 8 match wining streak, they had Blank. Point being, Blank isn't the reason why SKT slump
[7:54:30] vicushoo: 3-0?
[7:54:30] Narokuu: Me too @prigovor would bne fun watching my two favorite teams palying against ech other
