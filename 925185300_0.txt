[0:50:11] CertainlySomeoneHere: gonna brb for a bit
[0:50:11] syzygytft: @HyGGe LPL is probably the most stacked region
[0:50:15] Nitesearcher: There hasn't been a repeat split champion in the LPL in a long time
[0:50:37] delusionalfan: well lpl is stacked because there are 17 teams
[0:50:51] Vinny_RM: 17? whoa
[0:51:06] HalfaXan: LUL
[0:51:18] sunzedong: It's not good to be held at home. you’re upset every day
[0:51:22] HyGGe: Do LPL teams split up after winning or are they just not capable of keeping the drive to win up after winning worlds or what?
[0:51:23] 13Brioche: @delusionalfan if you had 17 teams in NA 15 would be absolute poo
[0:51:23] rumv1203: LCS>>>>>>LPL
[0:51:24] captainkrajick: I guess it's the most stacked, but the best to watch in terms of production is the LEC for me
[0:51:33] syzygytft: @delusionalfan not just because of the number of teams, but the amount of talent there is currently in the region
[0:51:34] mike_agaa: Y’all hear about uzi leaving RNG?
[0:51:36] AsfandorLoL: actually I think LCK overall has a higher Niveau than LPL.
[0:51:50] BroItsBren: match score predictions chat?
[0:51:58] CertainlySomeoneHere: @mikeagarrado That happened quite a while ago
[0:52:12] rumv1203: PCS>>>>>>>LPL

[0:52:32] Vinny_RM: DotA> LoL Kappa
[0:52:38] HyGGe: LPL is the NA of the east purely in terms of them buying talent from other regions right?
[0:52:40] aurasteal: @CertainlySomeoneHere isnt he bound by contract ?
[0:53:00] HyGGe: Don't then buy all the good Korean players?
[0:53:03] mike_agaa: @certainlysomeonehere Really? I just saw the news today. I guess I’m late lol
[0:53:16] sunzedong: lec is better than lcs. so let's go G2
[0:53:30] CertainlySomeoneHere: @aurasteal good question, I thought this happened quite a while ago since Uzi had issues with their hand and stuff
[0:53:42] delusionalfan: in the end koreans are still the best

[0:54:04] butters1584: HeyGuys
[0:54:08] badmanswe: @golden_jba don't hate my man
[0:54:12] syzygytft: @HyGGe I mean they do import top talents from other regions but they also have a good ecosystem that is why they have a lot of good homegrown players like knight,369 etc
[0:54:13] HyGGe: Last year it was LCK that got to oblitareate G2
[0:54:14] enzadeninothefirst: uzi retired
[0:54:14] CertainlySomeoneHere: In the end it doesn't matter where anyone is from what matters is that we see some cool league of legends y'all
[0:54:23] HalfaXan: The problem is that Korea is the meta, how can do it better will win worlds LUL
[0:54:32] AsfandorLoL: @certainlysomeonehere I think he is still with the org, but he's only playing SoloQ since his body is completely ruined

[0:54:51] Vinny_RM: hey @starchx
[0:55:04] idrinkkadarka: So do you guys think lpl will win worlds 2021?
[0:55:08] HyGGe: @CertainlySomeoneHere In the case of LCS, it is a little sad that 80% of their players are NOT from NA
[0:55:15] AsfandorLoL: @certainlysomeonehere yeah too bad
[0:55:16] butters1584: at least LPL imported right players KEKW
[0:55:28] HyGGe: true KEKW
[0:55:31] mnsapobvfdiu: EU WHY SO QUIET EleGiggle
[0:55:33] enzadeninothefirst: lpl really doesnt have a comparable amount of imports to NA
[0:55:45] CertainlySomeoneHere: @hygge no, even in the case of the LCS, It might be sad, but that doesn't make their plays invalid
[0:55:50] badmanswe: why so much hate against G2?
[0:55:50] butters1584: LPL imported top players and they won worlds 2 times but LCS? KEKW
[0:55:52] PauloFrassao: baianPray baianPray baianPray
[0:56:01] goodvibescarl: This one is pre-recorded right?
[0:56:12] hellosputnik: I don't care about the origin of LCS players. I just want the plays to actually be good.
[0:56:15] idrinkkadarka: @golden_jba LCS teams wants import law to be disbanded xD
[0:56:18] Vinny_RM: cuz they don't need to impor players @badmanswe
[0:56:22] Vinny_RM: TPFufun
[0:56:27] hardstuck_dad: Compare fkin Tarzan, Viper, Nuguri, Rookie etc. to the NA imports KEKW
[0:56:27] CertainlySomeoneHere: @hellosputnik this
[0:56:29] starchx: LCS is getting better guys.
[0:56:30] AsfandorLoL: LCK would most likely win worlds atm if edg would not been able to make an upset
[0:56:34] noem2k: @badmanswe people are just scared that they might actually win worlds and that their whole world would turn upside down
[0:56:35] starchx: 100T is good
[0:56:41] HyGGe: Only NA without imports would actually be NA KEKWait
[0:56:42] turza111: @goodvibescarl no
[0:56:54] idrinkkadarka: @AsfandorLoL I dont think so, damwon is kinda bad tho]
[0:56:59] turza111: @goodvibescarl maybe... not sure, just came xD maybe it's part of their podcast
[0:56:59] HyGGe: What is NA even caedDizzy
[0:57:09] Cosmoslol1: @golden_jba LUL
[0:57:10] butters1584: LPL imports = Rookie, Kanavi, Nuguri, TheShy, Viper LCS imports = Huni KEKW
[0:57:18] noem2k: I want to see the best possible talent have a shot at playing at the highest level no matter where they are born.
[0:57:21] CertainlySomeoneHere: @hygge Anyways please stop treating players as invalid simply because of where they are from ^^
[0:57:23] enzadeninothefirst: i hope t1 goes to worlds this year
[0:57:25] tangtang713: American sports leagues are built off imports
[0:57:29] guimauves: @badmanswe because fans overrate them so much and when they lose in worlds they give some silly reason like "they didnt take it seriously, theyre a troll team"
[0:57:40] doggojee: casters not acknowledging the massive impact LWX's eyebrows have on the team PepeHands
[0:57:41] HyGGe: @CertainlySomeoneHere Don't think i ever did that???
[0:57:49] enzadeninothefirst: gumayusi and keria are so good
[0:57:59] decco41: LCS imported washed up players with super high salaries and result hasnt improved, thats why owners want import rule removed LUL
[0:58:14] CertainlySomeoneHere: @hygge May be I misunderstood a message you said earlier
[0:58:14] Moobot: Catch all the LPL highlights on our Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/lpl.official/
[0:58:24] steven_eung: Scrims and practices in LCS are way less than LPL and LCK
[0:58:31] AsfandorLoL: @idrinkkadarka i think genG is kinda nutty right now, if they are not playing damwon
[0:58:43] delusionalfan: LCS is actually disgusting
[0:58:59] idrinkkadarka: @guimauves Maybe, but Damwon and T1 are overrated even more, they need to win worlds or korean fans thinks they are shit, even some parents won't support players after a loss
[0:58:59] goodvibescarl: @turza111 pty sure I listened to that podcast last week tho
[0:59:13] syzygytft: @CertainlySomeoneHere This. Ppl just want to see players fail just because they dont like the region. Memeing is fine and fun but fans should remember the limitations
[0:59:34] noem2k: Anti-importers are just illogical from my experience. I haven't seen any convincing reasoning that loosening or removing import rule is worse for the league.
[0:59:54] captainkrajick: LCS is regressing because there's no focus on coaching, drafting and development. Only thinking that just by getting 'better' players the whole league will get better
[0:59:58] sunzedong: Last year, G2 won Suning by experience, which proved that G2 is a respectable team, but what LCS should respect is not a team but a person. He is Peng Yiliang, the number one fan of Uzi in North America, a very powerful ADC player, but he was born at the wrong time and in the wrong place. In the end, he regretted that he didn't have his own skin and international champion
[1:00:01] metpig06: lpl is worst

[1:01:15] HalfaXan: Jungle is just op
[1:01:21] AsfandorLoL: anyone else here that thinks fnc can be the best LEC team if they get their shit together?
[1:01:22] llamapede: 2-0 EDG
[1:01:23] Mataresian: @noem2k just look at Overwacht league and that is the best argument already against ruining home grown talent
[1:01:26] HyGGe: Doublelift KEKW
[1:01:30] captainkrajick: @enjambree He was likely forced into it, might not be his fault
[1:01:34] stopwaiting1: when do the games begin?
[1:01:45] HyGGe: TSM 0-6 KEKW
[1:01:45] itsblazedog: when does the game start guys?

[1:02:08] stopwaiting1: can someone tell me if there was any games yet?
[1:02:11] HyGGe: If the voice s in my head speak the truth that is monkaW
[1:02:11] xALRock: finaly topic interrupted by an ad
[1:02:11] butters1584: the real problem is NA soloq is much smaller than other "MAJOR" regions KEKW
[1:02:23] stopwaiting1: were* idk
[1:02:24] CertainlySomeoneHere: Chat, I have an important question
[1:02:37] noem2k: KR soloq isn't a better experience just because people are 'developed' or 'trained' or whatever. They take it seriously because they have a competitive mentality inherently due to their culutre. NA's 'for-fun' mentality has permanently crippled them from start to finish.
[1:02:41] Ceramic_Llama: AYYYY VIPER MAH BOY
[1:02:44] martin76b: KEKW
[1:02:46] captainkrajick: @butters1584 The problem is culture on working hard to get better constantly.
[1:02:48] CertainlySomeoneHere: Why do people come into a stream and complain about people talking to much whose job is talking a lot LUL
[1:02:49] Luffy10941: Griffin viper KEKW
[1:02:54] Obywatel_Swiata: @AsfandorLoL I think the same but they need to sometimes take step back and play more reactive
[1:03:00] FK_P: It has nothing to do with coaching, infrastructure or money. NA is trash because the players are trash.
[1:03:16] syzygytft: @CertainlySomeoneHere Trueee
[1:03:21] noem2k: Guys the matches are starting according to schedule. if you dont like the talking. just mute.
[1:03:22] CertainlySomeoneHere: Like I don't know if some are so unfamiliar with esports that they're being genuine or LUL
[1:03:35] niktward: How long til game time
[1:03:37] CertainlySomeoneHere: @golden_jba then they can just mute the stream can't they? LUL
[1:03:41] xiqtmannen: @CertainlySomeoneHere its league communtity
[1:03:50] CertainlySomeoneHere: Also it's not like the game will come any faster if they don't talk
[1:03:55] Symfonyyy: @CertainlySomeoneHere them talking or not doesn't change anything, if you're not interested you move on and come back when the game starts
[1:03:55] jason6818: why does LPL have YouTube and Instagram? China can't even use it KEKW
[1:03:57] golsan1: ??Uzi will be comeback lpl???
[1:03:58] HyGGe: @enzadeninothefirst 5Head

[1:04:44] enzadeninothefirst: @jason6818 for western fans i guess
[1:04:48] CertainlySomeoneHere: @golden_jba Oh no, don't understand me wrong, I'm not expecting anything, in fact, I'm legitimately surprised every time I have a civil discussion in twitch chT
[1:05:06] rehs0m: BEVVYS WITH THE BOYYYYYS
[1:05:23] FK_P: if NA had no imports they would be worse than LMS and Vietnam
[1:05:29] HyGGe: Twitch chat is for memers, civil comunication is a bonus
[1:05:34] enzadeninothefirst: you have to donate 500$ to chinese communist party to get mod in lpl twitch chat
