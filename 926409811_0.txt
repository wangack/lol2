[0:42:29] DestroyaBot: I'm in chat for 30 seconds and I already see cringe G2 dickriders oh my
[0:42:38] a_particl: only hope is if LPL and LCK throw games

[0:42:51] peoxisths: @Zepharic Naaah TSM win worlds kekw
[0:42:52] Noshafasha: EDG EDG EDG
[0:42:54] averroesphilosope: @Aarcastle Wunder, Caps and Rekkles are mechanicaly talented in comparison to LCK and LPL players
[0:42:59] thug_shaker_o7: imports open any meals anyone  want MacDonald  and kfc
[0:43:05] a_particl: they were a contender last year too but they only have like a 20% chance imo
[0:43:15] luvsic_0: @cursed21st Knight didnt play that well too, we all know what hes capable of
[0:43:16] solarivalkyrie: Havent we all had this conversation about G2? Aren't they a proven commodity at this point?
[0:43:22] a_particl: they are talented all of them but not the most talented
[0:43:29] Zepharic: @peoxisths KEKW
[0:43:29] DestroyaBot: G2 is a great team but you EU kids are giga delusional to put them #1 when the season JUST started
[0:43:31] luvsic_0: @averroesphilosope KEKW
[0:43:35] DestroyaBot: things can change VERY fast
[0:43:42] averroesphilosope: @Aarcastle Nah I didnt think there was a chance of them winning worlds, I thought it would be 80% DWG, and 20% TES
[0:43:45] YuriSwine: Any Region that plays Bo1s are actual trash that's end of talk really.
[0:43:48] supreemx: Caps will clap Knight in worlds this year
[0:43:51] averroesphilosope: I didnt expect suning to pop off at worlds
[0:44:07] luvsic_0: bo1s isnt the problem
[0:44:13] averroesphilosope: Btw Im not a an EU fan, I hate G2 fans because they are so annoying and obnoxious
[0:44:13] peoxisths: FPX look like they could be back in 1st place
[0:44:27] a_particl: true but TES lost vs suning so there is hope for everyone
[0:44:32] averroesphilosope: @peoxisths Without a good jgler I doubt it, now that Tian is back
[0:44:39] peoxisths: @supreemx U compare 2 difrent playstiles( lane dominance vs roamming)
[0:44:40] a_particl: FPX does look hot
[0:44:45] DestroyaBot: bo1s is an issue lol it's not the only one but every pro says bo3s are better and it's better for the viewers
[0:44:45] thug_shaker_o7: forget about the  other reasons  this is lpl LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:44:47] a_particl: LUL

[0:45:18] supreemx: @peoxisths caps plays for the team, he can dominate lane i can assure u XD
[0:45:20] ImNAFB: Jankos PepeLaugh
[0:45:21] DestroyaBot: ratJAM
[0:45:38] averroesphilosope: Jankos is my favourite G2 player, he will proabably retire next year so I am hoping G2 or SKT win worlds this year
[0:45:40] a_particl: yeah the lack of competition in EU also sucks for G2 also if you think G2 will lose LEC with this roster you are probably more delusional than everyone
[0:46:02] supreemx: ^
[0:46:02] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[0:46:10] peoxisths: @supreemx He can dominate lane vs LEC mids like Larsen and Nisqy but Knight is on another level than those 2 xd
[0:46:13] thor_hummers: LUL LUL
[0:46:15] a_particl: fingers crossed my man @averroesphilosope
[0:46:15] B_Experience: pepeD
[0:46:35] averroesphilosope: Rogue tbh is a good team, not worlds level but quarterfinals or maybe even semis on a good day
[0:46:35] YuriSwine: As for DoinB and the boyz...till Bo gets cleared and does his punishment they are likely gonna fall down a bit
[0:47:02] DestroyaBot: yeah I mean EU has been a 2 team region for a VERY long time but FNC doesn't look bad still either with the loss of Rekkles G2 is just an even bigger super team than they were before so hopefully they do justice for the west but please G2 fans stop being cringe and delusional with these takes they hurt me to read lmao
[0:47:04] noem2k: i dont think SKT is coming back this year sadly
[0:47:05] averroesphilosope: ye FPX looking in trouble rn
[0:47:16] a_particl: how can Rogue get to semis I can't see that happening bro
[0:47:19] supreemx: @peoxisths that's just wrong XD, also u compare nisqy to larssen ? are u ok
[0:47:59] davidvxyx: rogue more like choke
[0:48:04] averroesphilosope: @Aarcastle They are a good team fundamentally, after watching their match vs G2, they played at a good enough level for me to believe that they can make it far
[0:48:16] averroesphilosope: FNC wont make it out of groups this year
[0:48:22] MillerTheKill3r: wtf lyrics
[0:48:22] noem2k: FNC has more potential without nemesis and rekkles
[0:48:46] thug_shaker_o7: @noem2k
[0:48:47] averroesphilosope: TL can make it out of groups if they are polished and clean, I honestly believe that CoreJJ is top 5 supports in the world
[0:48:51] epiphanic101: @noem2k No
[0:48:55] thug_shaker_o7: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:49:04] averroesphilosope: Corejj is 100% the best support in the west
[0:49:08] noem2k: your opinions suck. blocked.
[0:49:11] aklesita: catJAM
[0:49:15] averroesphilosope: and its kinda shocking how good he is compared to his region
[0:49:32] epiphanic101: TSM can't score lower than 0-6 if they just work harder this time
[0:49:37] solarivalkyrie: As he ran it down half the weekend DansGame
[0:49:39] peoxisths: who do u think top mids in the lec other than caps lol? Larsen and Humanoid bcs Blue is inting
[0:49:47] averroesphilosope: @solarivalkyrie True
[0:49:53] noem2k: does corejj count as true NA talent
[0:49:57] R1PP3RZx: RA 2-0, WE 2-0, LPL 2-0 strike will continue
[0:50:04] supreemx: caps and larssen are levels above every mid laner in LEC
[0:50:05] DestroyaBot: yeah I mean CoreJJ is nasty man TL is a super team rn they're FUMBLING as we speak it's kinda sad to watch but I trust they pick it up for the rest of the season and havea good showing
[0:50:06] Sov25: @peoxisths In the world sense or LEC talent only?
[0:50:07] peoxisths: according to their team placement thats the top 5 mids
[0:50:14] YSoWavy9: anyone watching LEC? Treatz kinda playing like the top support at the moment
[0:50:23] epiphanic101: catJAM
[0:50:25] SensualCharmm: can’t wait for the game to start
[0:50:26] peoxisths: @Sov25 LEC ofc xd
[0:50:39] SensualCharmm: Hello chatters
[0:50:49] matchamatchawee: Yo
[0:50:51] noem2k: treatz and BB are NA champions. cant expect any less
[0:50:58] averroesphilosope: Top 5 mids rn are, 1. Showmaker/Rookie 2. Chovy 3. Knight 4. Caps 5. Bdd
[0:51:05] averroesphilosope: Top 6 I guess
[0:51:12] Sov25: Like any other LEC year without perkz mid. Caps > gap > larsen/humanoid > gap > whoever
[0:51:19] averroesphilosope: I dont know who is better between Rookie and Showmaker
[0:51:28] solarivalkyrie: NA champ who went 0-6 against international competition @noem2k
[0:51:33] thor_hummers: cblol > NA > g2
[0:51:36] epiphanic101: @averroesphilosope Showmaker is overrated
[0:51:37] Sov25: The fact that people still put rookie top mid says a lot about their view
[0:51:41] peoxisths: @noem2k Tsm traded BB for Hunni  KEKW
[0:51:44] DestroyaBot: I mean I wouldn't even put Showmaker top 3 lol I would say Chovy Knight Caps Showmaker Rookie
[0:51:46] supreemx: @thor_hummers even u dont believe that XD
[0:51:54] averroesphilosope: @epiphanic101 He is on a good team, but that doesnt make him overrated
[0:51:55] bALLinn3: i think chovy is better than both of them
[0:52:06] Sov25: @averroesphilosope That sounds like rookie tbh LUL
[0:52:08] averroesphilosope: Nah Showmaker is a better mid laner imo than Chovy
[0:52:09] supreemx: showmaker the type of midlaner that has insane teammates to send him ahead
[0:52:09] DestroyaBot: Chovy best mid world rn don't @ me
[0:52:09] JeffHinoto: CEBOLAO > CBLOL > NA @thor_hummers
[0:52:11] matchamatchawee: Church of Chovy
[0:52:22] Sov25: Never forget when rookie ran it down S9 summer and still made it in top 20 worlds
[0:52:25] DestroyaBot: Chovy's team was WAY worse than Showmaker's
[0:52:28] averroesphilosope: Chovy is the best midlaner laning, but mid and late, other midlaners are better
[0:52:31] Nico79x: @thor_hummers butthurd fanboy
[0:52:32] epiphanic101: @averroesphilosope He's overrated if you're gonna put him top 1
[0:52:32] tenentmigas12: Who says that na is good is just trolling rn
[0:52:34] Sov25: Rookie is the kawhi Leonard of LoL

[0:53:58] QlevY: cant even write down nick properly LUL
[0:53:58] solarivalkyrie: Ghost was not the best adc in 2020 though
[0:54:08] averroesphilosope: @peoxisths I was talking midlaners
[0:54:17] Sov25: @epiphanic101 So why is rookie the top mid despite having mediocre stats? Are we going to pretend he's on a bad team still?
[0:54:26] peoxisths: ok mb
[0:54:33] thor_hummers: @QlevY malding by sacrasm haHAA g2 fan girl
[0:54:46] averroesphilosope: @Sov25 He is 100% limited by his team, just like faker tbh
[0:54:48] thug_shaker_o7: ESg full of trols  can be 8-0 LUL LUL
[0:54:56] supreemx: rekkles and hily were the best bot @ worlds no doubt, but unlucky
[0:55:00] DestroyaBot: these takes are hurting me to read, I'ma go brush my teeth I suggest you G2 kids do the same we all know the EU teeth meme I wouldn't watch you guys to be one of them ratJAM
[0:55:07] peoxisths: @supreemx true
[0:55:16] Sov25: @averroesphilosope Except the difference is rookie gets more prio on lane and resources. He has more agency to win the game.
[0:55:22] makabuluhanin: CatJam
[0:55:24] thug_shaker_o7: LUL LUL
[0:55:34] averroesphilosope: Top 5 ADC rn, 1. Ruler 2. Viper 3. Rekkles/JKL 5. Gumayusi
[0:55:35] epiphanic101: @sov25 stats are decided a lot by your early pressure and your team's participation so yeah, though I'm not necessarily saying rookie is top 1 either
[0:55:59] peoxisths: @averroesphilosope JKL really inted worlds though
[0:56:08] epiphanic101: @averroesphilosope That's a straightforward LUL
[0:56:11] noem2k: rookie is only rated that high because NARRATIVES

[0:56:14] supreemx: @averroesphilosope Viper>Rekkles>Guma/JKL>Ruler imo
[0:56:17] averroesphilosope: @peoxisths True but I still think he is top 3 adcs in the world
[0:56:21] fus73: gumayusi LUL
[0:56:21] SensualCharmm: Pog it’s almost on
[0:56:30] ImNAFB: this song sucks catJAM
[0:56:41] averroesphilosope: Ruler to me, is nearly the perfect adc, he is so insanely good I have to put him as number 1
[0:56:43] Sov25: @noem2k Yea he's the kawhi leonard of LoL. When he finally gets a peak again people will say "that's why hes my #1" LUL
[0:56:45] TfcMyq: @noem2k 1v9'd entire 2020
[0:56:48] SensualCharmm: Super excited LUL LUL
[0:56:50] peoxisths: @averroesphilosope yes prob
[0:56:55] averroesphilosope: Have you guys seen Ruler play in LCK, dude is insane
[0:57:03] noem2k: @TfcMyq you can only say that if they won anything
[0:57:05] TfcMyq: ruler is still good no doubt
[0:57:28] TfcMyq: alright buddy
[0:57:33] worlds2024: UZI LUL
[0:57:40] averroesphilosope: Top 5 Toplaners rn, 1. Nuguri 2. Zoom 3. Flandre 4. Khan 5. Wunder
[0:57:40] TfcMyq: results-based analysis
[0:57:48] synthpopthot: ruler best adc now that uzi is retired
[0:57:49] peoxisths: Reckles said that Ruller was the toughest adc he played against in worlds 2020
[0:57:52] thor_hummers: cblol > NA > G2 fan trds LULW
[0:57:52] supreemx: @averroesphilosope yes but he flopped against Rekkles and Hily XD
[0:57:58] vermontbbb: who wins?
[0:58:01] epiphanic101: @averroesphilosope He's good but it's debatable whether he should be top 5 or not, rather than being top 1. Have you seen him against Guma?
[0:58:05] TfcMyq: viper vs ruler at worlds pls
[0:58:08] hnbl10: Ruler is the best adc in the world atm
[0:58:17] bALLinn3: thought on jackeylove?
[0:58:22] Sov25: @supreemx With his ear infection. No one mentions their 2nd match when he got 2v2'd by B tier bot lane picks LUL
[0:58:25] averroesphilosope: Ruler mechanically, to me watching his proviews, is the best adc in the worlds
[0:58:28] noem2k: theres a difference between successfully 1v9'ing to 1v9'ing and failing
[0:58:29] worlds2024: TheShy LUL

[0:58:39] averroesphilosope: I cant wait to see where he ends up
[0:58:40] Sov25: When you die to Aphelios/Taric in S10 worlds you need to retire
[0:58:45] TfcMyq: idg why people are hating on iG when their match is 2 days away
[0:58:46] synthpopthot: RAKAN NO FLASH KEKW
[0:59:06] averroesphilosope: For TheShy, he is very good but other toplaners in the LPL are better than him rn, he like 5th best lpl top
[0:59:09] boybad10000: NA MUSIC WutFace WutFace
[0:59:10] peoxisths: @BjAIIen He is 2 aggressive and ints games bcs he flashes in all the time. But he is still top 5 i think
[0:59:11] supreemx: Its funny how none of you appreciate how consistent Rekkles is
[0:59:24] TfcMyq: @noem2k when u have 4 inters and lose because of that, it would seem worse
[0:59:32] averroesphilosope: Rekkles is 100% 3rd or 4th best adc in the world
[0:59:57] noem2k: IG has no clue how to draft. and theshy just rolls a roulette during select
[0:59:58] TfcMyq: @averroesphilosope idt he's found his groove yet whereas nuguri
[0:59:59] averroesphilosope: @jothepuro Prime theShy is the best topplaner of all time, I an agree with you on that
[1:00:01] Sov25: @averroesphilosope WutFace
[1:00:18] TfcMyq: no secret that the coaches dont draft for iG
[1:00:29] averroesphilosope: Prime TheShy is 100% the best top laner mechanically of all time
[1:00:30] 마지막날의베모라: tnt4wkJANHA
[1:00:35] averroesphilosope: Rn he isnt so good
[1:00:40] epiphanic101: @jothepuro There's no actual prime here, guy is 21 yrs old
[1:00:44] Sov25: This is why people have bad takes. Peak theshy has to prove he can play well in nearly any meta. He can't. He's one of the worst weak side top laners ever.
[1:00:53] Nahxela: SourPls
[1:00:55] thatsdanny4u: lol so corny

[1:01:45] epiphanic101: @tfcmyq That saying there's a "prime" for people where they're weaker after is a myth
