[3:20:38] vicviper: Uzi retired
[3:20:45] Jesus_ls_Here: i think he's still contracted to RNG as streamer
[3:21:17] jfraks: but there were some rumors these days saying that he may sign with ig, but there was some problems with the contract
[3:21:23] semandemon22: He’s still “owned” by them
[3:22:09] jesussellscrack: uzi needs to sort out his health
[3:22:10] semandemon22: Hysterics triggered
[3:22:28] semandemon22: Jesus is here... selling crack...
[3:22:44] vicviper: there is no way he goes to IG, IG is a sinking ship

[3:25:14] Moobot: Calm the spam, @xiao4728 (warning)
[3:25:19] sunzedong: Qiuqiu from TES to RW and Qiuqiu is the veteran of TES so he is very familiar with TES and the state of TES is not good so TES is negative to RW

[3:25:33] jesussellscrack: i heard JKL was closed to joining RNG at one point to come in for uzi
[3:26:07] IAintThatGuy: modCheck
[3:26:15] vicviper: yeah JKL was because his relative tricked him and almost locked him into a shit contract with rng
[3:26:24] jesussellscrack: why did xiaohu move from mid to top lane
[3:26:38] vicviper: but TES use $ to pull JKL out of the mess

[3:30:37] 21044275: @vicviper You can autofill a top and they'll be better than Ziv
[3:30:45] SensualCharmm: Pog
[3:30:53] 21044275: @vicviper At least a young player will actually be good mechanically
[3:30:58] dlegacy22: Sub support?

[3:39:14] 21044275: The fact that he starts for a tier 1 NA team, says about the region
[3:39:27] semandemon22: @21044275 knows everything
[3:39:41] sunzedong: And so far, Ziv's DMG/M and DT/M are the reciprocal of Top Laner's GRF. Sword is several times stronger than him, of course, the unit can play the most damage is Theshy
