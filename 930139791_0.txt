[0:28:29] armanik3ys: Wow looks like two bad teams playing lol
[0:29:23] Jenabellaa: RNG vs FPX waiting room

[0:29:40] hail_whale: catJAM
[0:30:12] averroesphilosope: Which jungler will FPX be using today, Tian or the new guy?
[0:30:34] averroesphilosope: Actual feelsbadman that Bo got suspended, dude was really good
[0:30:47] TRv5T: bo BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:31:02] TRv5T: Bo > Tian
[0:31:07] lucaroide: coe rapaziada
[0:31:07] hardstuck_dad: @averroesphilosope they will use the new guy
[0:31:20] TRv5T: i love fpx but they gonna lose today lol
[0:31:21] Ant_Slays: Bo has been playing amazing when he played
[0:31:27] hardstuck_dad: Ye, only weakness that Bo had was that he is kinda awful at smite battles
[0:31:35] averroesphilosope: Tian is not bad dudes, hes just having a lot of health issues that I cant fault him for, its just really unfortunate
[0:31:51] averroesphilosope: Tian in 2019 was top 5 jglers in world
[0:31:53] ultranovel: Bo was literally league on his own in LDL even though he was forced to fixed matches
[0:31:54] Ant_Slays: theyr'e both good but its sad to see Bo lose his job
[0:32:01] Daipak: damn of course the best series is last classic lpl
[0:32:03] averroesphilosope: Yep
[0:32:11] ultranovel: BO is a lost opportunity for lpl
[0:32:19] averroesphilosope: Very unfortunate
[0:32:20] Ant_Slays: that man got 27 kills that one series
[0:32:25] hardstuck_dad: @averroesphilosope what? 2019 Tian was probably the best, or at least top 2
[0:32:31] TRv5T: JG and Bot was the reason why fpx wasnt succesful last season
[0:32:43] hardstuck_dad: You can say only Clid was on par with him
[0:32:51] averroesphilosope: @takesusanoonomikoto Ye, I think he was 2 after Tarzan. I only said 5 to be more objective
[0:32:52] jairranilla: RNG will win today over FPX
[0:33:11] hardstuck_dad: Not sure. Tarzan didnt impress me as much back then
[0:33:11] TRv5T: hate to say it but yeah rng may win lol
[0:33:16] averroesphilosope: RNG will probably win today considering that their jgler must have little scrim time
[0:33:19] ultranovel: BO was so good in LDL and he ahs such a dream start in LPL sadness for fpx and him
[0:33:22] averroesphilosope: fpx jgler*
[0:33:30] Ant_Slays: peepoSad
[0:33:37] averroesphilosope: Tarzan in 2019 looked like the best jgler in the wrold
[0:33:45] runuf: @jairranilla u sure RaccAttack
[0:33:46] gnasches: fpx will win
[0:33:49] averroesphilosope: in 2020 best jgler was Canyon
[0:33:56] gnasches: i am sure
[0:34:10] jairranilla: why is that? @gnasches
[0:34:22] averroesphilosope: I want FPX to win, but I think they are going to have a major slump from now on
[0:34:25] gnasches: beichuan
[0:34:27] hardstuck_dad: Debatable I guess. I liked Tian and Clid more than Tarzan but you could say they had a better teammates
[0:34:27] Ant_Slays: as good as FPX im just not a big fan of them weirdly
[0:34:41] TRv5T: @averroesphilosope same
[0:35:10] runuf: catJAM
[0:35:11] gnasches: beichuan will come and save fpx
[0:35:15] hovha: what is this song
[0:35:15] averroesphilosope: Dude am I the only one pissed at how SKT is handling their roster
[0:35:36] averroesphilosope: They have such good player but none of them have synergy except faker and keria
[0:35:39] jairranilla: @gnasches beichuan comes from ldl, not sure if he's gonna make it with so little practice time
[0:35:42] Daipak: definetely not lmao
[0:35:56] Hamstercrush: This music speaks to me
[0:36:02] Daipak: it's very outspoken amongst western fans probably korean fans too
[0:36:03] Hamstercrush: I am special ^_^
[0:36:15] averroesphilosope: Am I the only one who wants Faker to win one more worlds title, everywhere I go people be clowning on faker dude
[0:36:20] hardstuck_dad: @averroesphilosope I think they just set this  spring for hard experimenting. No other reason they would swap players as much
[0:36:21] averroesphilosope: Feels bad
[0:36:30] gnasches: but i trust fpx
[0:36:42] Ant_Slays: I wont be up for game 2 and 3
[0:37:03] ultranovel: also rookie got a huge gift by chinese fan for his bday screen time share for 7 days  in one of the big building of shanghai
[0:37:04] averroesphilosope: @takesusanoonomikoto From what I see, the atmosphere looks super stressful and competitive. How can they field a synergistic roster with so much competing
[0:37:08] Ant_Slays: actually for all of them lol
[0:37:27] TRv5T: every team in lcs has like 4/5 imports and they still crying...i dont get it lol
[0:37:28] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[0:37:42] wjdgjsgh98: T1 WAITINGROOM ResidentSleeper
[0:37:43] hardstuck_dad: I really hope SKT just stick with guma and let Teddy come to LPL and upgrade some already strong roster like JDG or IG
[0:38:01] Ant_Slays: Teddy > Gumayhisi ?
[0:38:07] ultranovel: @TRv5T just imagine theshy playing for tsm and inting KEKW
[0:38:16] gnasches: gumayusi＞teddy
[0:38:26] averroesphilosope: @takesusanoonomikoto SKT needs to let Canna and Teddt go to good teams like HLE and DWG, Teddy and Canna would do good there
[0:38:35] averroesphilosope: Rn Teddy = Gumayusi
[0:38:35] TRv5T: @ultranovel puke
[0:38:47] Ant_Slays: idk I need to more Teddy
[0:38:51] hardstuck_dad: Oh yeah, Canna too. Would be really sad if he and Teddy sit at the bench
[0:38:52] averroesphilosope: Teddy has more exp but Guma has raw potential and mechanics
[0:39:09] averroesphilosope: Canna was so good last year, I dont know whats going on this year
[0:39:13] ultranovel: guma reminds of gala for some reason
[0:39:19] averroesphilosope: Must be the stress or some other factor
[0:39:23] 빼먹기쉬운: gumayusi<teddy
[0:39:31] Ant_Slays: if they stop making subs in between series theyd be better imo
[0:39:34] ultranovel: like they have similar potential and play style guma and gala
[0:39:35] LMAOKAI88: ^
[0:39:38] ehop_: LPL woooo
[0:39:42] Ant_Slays: that messes up the chem doing that
[0:39:50] averroesphilosope: Imagine this SKT Roster: Zeus, Tarzan, Faker, Gumayusi, Keria. Actually insane team
[0:40:01] averroesphilosope: Worlds level roster
[0:40:34] Daipak: would rather have teddy in the lineup he makes less boneheaded plays than guma
[0:40:36] Ant_Slays: they should have a no sub rule
[0:40:58] hardstuck_dad: It's obvious they are gonna stick with Guma at the long-term
[0:41:00] averroesphilosope: @Daipak True, but Gumayusi is such a good player it would be foolish to give him to another team
[0:41:09] Daipak: everyone is underatting teddy because he had to play with effort last season
[0:41:22] Daipak: but i really think the reason both bot lanes are doing so well this season are because keria is just better
[0:41:32] averroesphilosope: Teddy is really good no joke, but I dont think he is better than Gumayusi long term
[0:41:43] Ant_Slays: Gumayi is they're guy I agree they prob know that
[0:41:55] Ant_Slays: they're just easing him into the role
[0:42:15] averroesphilosope: Im not a G2 fan by any means, but I want them to win worlds this year
[0:42:32] Daipak: that's true they are probably looking to field guma looking forward but feels foolish to give up on teddy so soon
[0:42:51] Ant_Slays: Teddy might even be the better carry if I had to pick
[0:42:55] Daipak: can't really go wrong with a low resource/high impact adc like him
[0:43:00] averroesphilosope: Before Jankos retires I want to see him hold the trophy just once
[0:43:50] NytroBlaster: rng vs fpx Pog

[0:54:54] bjartscales: both are garbage, so who knows
[0:55:00] Zaburino: i heard T1 will settle on their final roster after the first half of the summer split
[0:55:02] TastyAMG: Oner looks really good so far
[0:55:12] el_mago721: did they just give up on cuzz? he was decent
[0:55:26] el_mago721: elimm was meh
[0:55:28] TastyAMG: cuzz has not been playing well unfortunately
[0:55:39] 1majordota: if ellim still gonna play t1 never gonna win
[0:55:46] el_mago721: that's fair then. I like zeus
[0:55:55] el_mago721: he's a beast for so young
[0:56:09] TastyAMG: True he is so good
[0:56:14] burninkushmaga: RW OR LGD?

[0:56:27] el_mago721: keria might be best supp world too
[0:56:30] Daipak: zeus is super solid except when he gets left out to dry
[0:56:32] JohniBoy: LGD
[0:56:45] TastyAMG: Keria is bonkers
[0:56:54] basken: When does uzi play?
[0:57:18] bjartscales: Uzi is moving to TL once import rule is lifted
[0:57:20] el_mago721: if oner pans out I can see a 7 man roster with him zeus and keria then the two mids and adcs
[0:57:20] JohniBoy: Beryl > Keria
[0:57:21] TastyAMG: he retired :(

[6:43:17] lakershomie08: @rufosabarez Yes they can, but they probably won't
[6:43:25] ye1l: i mean the pros are the ones at fault. If every pro player in NA took soloq very seriously instead of players like Jensen literally inting for fun, the overall quality of soloq would improve drastically in NA
[6:43:32] rafawnunes: @rufosabarez I guess
[6:44:10] lakershomie08: @ye1l A lot of pros use SoloQ strictly to int on stream.
[6:44:13] Zachary_Blobman: @ye1l but they get triggered very quick if they take seriously cause people around them kinda ints
[6:44:57] Nadro: @21044275 i mean, there's 70 millions players in the Chinese Region spread across 20 servers and 1 super server for serious players. so it's okay to have half the talent streamer based. but with NA, there's only 1 server with no private server for young/serious players to take advantage of

[6:54:44] ye1l: @baneviper he was forced to, essentially matchfix or get benched and never get to go pro.
[6:54:45] Kun2_: @ongkhoi18 talking gold 4
[6:54:54] 03c63ef3: How is beichuan? I missed first game
[6:55:00] 21044275: @baneviper Teenagers don't consider the consequences and their future
[6:55:01] ye1l: it's unfortunately really common in the LDL
[6:55:10] kateka: @baneviper He was potentially forced into it but that's for the investigation to decide
[6:55:18] ziosevielspezel: i mean bo reported it himself right
[6:55:20] ye1l: Beichuan is not bad
[6:55:25] ziosevielspezel: if he did that earlier he could have been saved
[6:55:26] kateka: @baneviper Yes
[6:55:28] fbritra005: who got better draft?
[6:55:32] Irezzy12: what happen to bo is he still in pro play
[6:55:37] kateka: @03c63ef3 He's good so far
[6:55:47] 21044275: Beichuan isn't bad, but he is no Bo. Beichuan is at least 1 tier lower in terms of talent
[6:55:59] kateka: @irezzy12 He's currently benched on FPX's roster until the investigation is over
[6:56:05] PropietarioDeForocoches: Heca with ignite/smite = free elo
[6:56:06] Nadro: @baneviper it wasnt him specifically, it was the organisation he was playing for in 2019/20 Estar Young
[6:56:06] ziosevielspezel: @21044275  we could see how great bo was
[6:56:25] Irezzy12: @kateka thanks for that
[6:56:25] ye1l: last player who got banned from evidently being forced to matchfix was a 1 year ban, but he didn't admit it himself like Bo did, so it's possible that Bo gets a slightly shorter punishment
[6:56:28] selphoenia: bo is actually a second dopa no? an insane´player that will never play pro again cause he did something in his past
[6:56:29] ziosevielspezel: @Nadro  so whole organization gonna get banned?
[6:56:39] redpack3t: you wouldnt know what Bo has gone through in LDL, maybe if he didnt agree to matchfixing, we wouldn't even see him on LPL
[6:56:44] kateka: @21044275 So is every LDL jungler tbf so it's not really a fair comparison

[7:40:24] Moobot: THE LPL NOW HAS AN OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER! Join here: https://discord.com/invite/tZBguQtcAc
[7:40:35] ye1l: @n3kochyan 2 main reasons is that SN was overperforming when they got to finals whilst the other LPL teams they went up against underperformed and SA was basically the sole shot-caller on SN
[7:41:22] ye1l: like the expected result for SN against a full power TES/JDG in 2020 should've been a 3-1 or 3-0 with SN losing
[7:41:41] SensualCharmm: Later
[7:41:55] ye1l: but TES and JDG was just bad at worlds so SN got to finals through mostly luck
[7:42:00] SensualCharmm: Rise up rise up
[7:42:01] Zerimas_: ratJAM
[7:42:27] CoastersWW: Rng 2-0?
[7:42:42] Tialee: lebronJAM ratJAM
[7:42:58] noem2k: luck Kappa
[7:43:09] ye1l: Worlds was pretty much scripted after groups, whichever team of G2 or SN that ended up on the opposite side of the bracket to Damwon would make finals
[7:43:11] l3vi1: luck KEKW
