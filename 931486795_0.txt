[0:30:15] hardstuck_dad: @lianga1066 there is no consistent region dude, only teams
[0:30:42] lianga1066: ig i mean the best region
[0:30:49] lianga1066: worded it wrongly
[0:30:51] loveyou11223: SN
[0:30:55] hardstuck_dad: It's probably still the LPL
[0:31:01] hardstuck_dad: but Damwon are the best team
[0:31:09] IndyBabe: @takesusanoonomikoto yeah that's why JDG and TES are number one and two again this year, because of consistency
[0:31:14] IndyBabe: oh wait
[0:31:18] lipikarbaume: Let’s go lng

[0:31:49] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe what? Didnt understand what you mean
[0:32:27] IndyBabe: @takesusanoonomikoto teams aren't as consistent as regions are.
[0:32:53] levirbarros: yep
[0:32:58] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe completely false. There is no thing as consistent region.
[0:33:00] IndyBabe: suning aka sucking, gotem KEKW
[0:33:23] badpinggoodbrain: TARZAN Pof
[0:33:25] IndyBabe: yeah thats why LPL and LCK have won the last like 7 tourneys?
[0:33:30] badpinggoodbrain: Tarzan Pog
[0:33:40] jeffnerdy: is that tarazan ?
[0:33:46] badpinggoodbrain: yes
[0:34:04] levirbarros: suning with 5 loses, omg this team was the best in world
[0:34:04] DragonBlade7000: hey guys, are there 3 games today?
[0:34:20] lianga1066: V5 RA IG
[0:34:25] IndyBabe: @levir_barros no they weren't they had a miracle worlds run
[0:34:26] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe Dude, consistency means something completely different. Google it up :)
[0:34:41] DragonBlade7000: I dont remember this stream ever having any mor ethan 2 games a night
[0:34:48] DragonBlade7000: or 2 series rather
[0:34:52] lianga1066: ,e2
[0:34:57] lianga1066: me2
[0:35:08] hardstuck_dad: The fact that LPL and LCK have won the last 7 tournaments or something means they are just the best, not the most consistent
[0:35:08] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[0:35:17] tech040: yo moobot people name have diffrent lang how to reply then?
[0:35:22] IndyBabe: Suning was shit up until they had absolutely incredibly lucky worlds run until they got dumpstered by a team that didnt troll in DWG
[0:35:39] DragonBlade7000: realistic question to the ppl, do you think NA can even win worlds in the next 10 years?
[0:36:04] badpinggoodbrain: @DragonBlade7000 nope
[0:36:06] lianga1066: ye
[0:36:11] tech040: until import rule is removed NO KEKW
[0:36:14] IndyBabe: @DragonBlade7000 anything is possible, probable on the other hand, ehhhhhhhhhh
[0:36:16] lianga1066: wow rly, that's depressing
[0:36:21] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe you dont get lucky beating two times G2, smashing JDG and TES and taking a game off DWG. It means they were doing something right :)
[0:36:25] badpinggoodbrain: even if they remove import rule they cant
[0:36:38] DragonBlade7000: I hope they dont get rid of the import rule, it wouldnt feel like good old CLOWN na anymore
[0:36:52] IndyBabe: @takesusanoonomikoto you must not have watching the entirety of the regular season
[0:36:54] badpinggoodbrain: east culture and work ethic is just better suited for league
[0:36:56] levirbarros: NA have must problens. is difficulty her win a wordl
[0:37:15] oHAMBURGLARo: 10 years is a long time though, who knows what can happen by then. However, something drastic would have to happen for NA to win worlds
[0:37:19] tech040: lol then it wont be NA then, just call it world
[0:37:25] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe I have. You could also say SSG were lucky when they won Worlds, becahse they werent really a top team outside of the said tournament.
[0:37:35] badpinggoodbrain: for NA to win worlds, you need to have NA talent to begin with If it's all import team it's just NA org winning not NA player
[0:37:46] levirbarros: the worlds is more easy to a team korean or china win
[0:38:05] tech040: b03 helps after groups
[0:38:05] badpinggoodbrain: even china didnt win without kr mid top
[0:38:16] IndyBabe: @takesusanoonomikoto JDG and TES hard trolled their series's that was les Suning beng good and JDG and TES playing bad on the worlds meta
[0:38:26] badpinggoodbrain: kr soloq too op
[0:38:55] levirbarros: the NA teams dont have same consistence of a european team
[0:39:02] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe ye, they had their troll moments but sunning outplayed them multiple times in teamfights even from behind, plus they had better macro decisions. They were just better
[0:39:04] tech040: kr soloq after D1 is op rest is same clown fiesta KEKW
[0:39:06] lianga1066: why
[0:39:15] lianga1066: @levir_barros
[0:39:59] tech040: cause unlike na eu develop talents rather than getting imports
[0:40:00] hardstuck_dad: JDG and TES troll like every fkin game, even last year. But why didnt the other teams win vs them
[0:40:21] STARFORCEeinfachkrass: NA #1 Seed.. 0-6 .... NA ARE YOU FOR REAL??? give first seed to taiwan/vietnam etc.
[0:40:23] dobrique24: Lng taking this
[0:40:24] IndyBabe: @takesusanoonomikoto suning level 1'd JDG every game so JDG were playing from behind every single game. They didnt know how to play the worlds meta. Suning lucked into a favorable meta right when worlds happened and they had it solved going in.
[0:40:26] 허니버럴알먼드: omg is ohmygod?
[0:40:36] lianga1066: y
[0:40:38] levirbarros: @lianga1066 because the result her have in worlds competitive. the best times are korean, european and china, this is actually
[0:40:42] theomgfather: ratJAM
[0:40:46] 허니버럴알먼드: ohmygod
[0:41:07] IndyBabe: Worlds meta was literally lvl 1 invade every game and set the other team behind and if you won the level one you wwon the game
[0:41:10] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe okay. That doesnt mean they were lucky. It means they were just a better team at that meta. You can't take that away from them, sorry.
[0:41:21] tech040: i dont think so KEKW imagine a team OH MY GOD KEKW
[0:41:37] IndyBabe: it was a cheese meta that favorables coin flipping shitty teams
[0:41:42] BoBByreeno: lng or v5?
[0:41:49] tech040: well after watching their rank i might say OMG KEKW
[0:41:50] IndyBabe: it didnt favor TES or JDG wwhow ere better teams
[0:41:56] LmaoLp: sadly, it's kinda like "oh my god this team is so bad" these days FeelsBadMan
[0:42:05] 2145733432: gut says LNG but head says V5
[0:42:07] hardstuck_dad: @IndyBabe too bad it didnt favour TSM :(
[0:42:18] guimauves: adaptability to the meta is a measure of a team's strength though, i mean people like faker have career wins spanning from hypercarries to support tanks
[0:42:19] levirbarros: jungle patching full leash is best than invade??

[0:49:31] BoBByreeno: how good is lng
[0:49:34] lianga1066: is swordart the best sup in lcs?

[3:15:03] jailedmurphy: yea i wasnt a huge fan of OMG was summer. looks like a different line up now though.
[3:15:07] goblinguy01: I actually believe OMG wouldn't beat CLG...
[3:15:15] mostdopegypsy: Just remove the bottom 4 teams in LPL
[3:15:17] jamesa1121: lpl are pretty much just kids all they do is play this game ofc they are good
[3:15:19] 21044275: Usually mid laners in CN Challenger have champion puddles
[3:15:23] jamesa1121: all so young

[3:16:29] jailedmurphy: dude said flash burn from hang like hes not using hexflash lol
[3:16:31] goblinguy01: Pretty sure OMG and V5 owners could buy half of NA teams...
[3:16:33] mostdopegypsy: OMG, RW and LGD don’t deserve a spot
[3:16:34] 21044275: This team is very good
[3:16:38] ogti10champ: omg worst team ever
[3:16:51] mostdopegypsy: Would make the games much more interesting
[3:16:56] chilledgh0st: @eiratxk maybe just slightly better than bottom 4 in lpl other than that every other team can smash them
[3:16:59] zziya_d: OMG FeelsWeirdMan
[3:17:09] esbomgaroto: Who won last game?
[3:17:15] FK_P: they were good last season too
[3:17:27] 21044275: @chilledgh0st You actually believe CLG is better than the bottom LPL teams? Go take a look at CLG's roster LUL
[3:17:33] zerokxdd: with franchise system, orgs can just build mediocre rosters and dont get penalized ....
[3:17:43] 21044275: @chilledgh0st I'm not even hating on NA, but CLG is just way too bad to even beat bottom LPL teams
[3:18:04] epiphanic101: OMEGALUL MG LUL
[3:18:05] chilledgh0st: @21044275 I said maybe cuz some lpl bottom 4 games at some games I've watched looked really bad no hate
[3:18:23] 21044275: No matter how bad they are, they aren't as bad as CLG
[3:18:33] chilledgh0st: I guess ur right
[3:18:35] 21044275: Just in terms of pure mechanics, they stomp CLG players
[3:19:01] Machokist: OMEGALUL M G unique
[3:19:05] LmaoLp: anyone got that "near airport" copypasta Kappa
[3:19:11] multistr1ke: @The_Most_Interesting_Guy Didnt they also lost to a wildcard in their group or something?
[3:19:15] jamesa1121: tsm is not best team in na
[3:19:26] jamesa1121: was not best last year for fact
[3:19:35] epiphanic101: @21044275 I doubt that judgment is actually based on observing the patters of the players performance in both regions rather than just following the majority narrative that LPL teams are just better than NA
[3:19:37] l3vi1: they were 1st seed
[3:19:46] FK_P: it was Fnatic, GenG, LGD and TSM
[3:19:47] jamesa1121: seeds dont mean shit
[3:19:48] zerokxdd: @jac112193 ? 1st seed
[3:19:55] multistr1ke: That just shows how garbage NA is in general, then the TSM goes to Worlds just because theyre the least garbage of all teams
[3:19:59] jamesa1121: worlds is different then playing at home
[3:20:01] zhuangnauhz: doublelift  is retired right?
[3:20:02] chilledgh0st: @jac112193 If being first seed and beating all other teams in the league doesn't mean their the best idk what is
[3:20:08] zerokxdd: @jac112193 means you won the league
[3:20:09] jamesa1121: NA deff is garnbo tho
[3:20:22] hellodifferentworld: SKIP
[3:20:26] 21044275: @epiphanic101 I actually watch LCS on Huya, so I follow NA, and I know CLG is not better than bottom LPL teams
[3:20:27] multistr1ke: And they would've never done so if FBI didnt int the series vs GG away, especially remembering how he and Huhi were bodying TSMs botlane all series
[3:20:43] jailedmurphy: oh shit these are the first pro games im watching since mythics were introduced. :D
[3:20:48] FK_P: Losing twice to a team with LangX
[3:21:05] 21044275: Langx, Mark, Peanut Kappa

[3:21:29] jailedmurphy: OLAF CLEEEAN
[3:21:37] epiphanic101: @21044275 Yeah but simply watching isn't the same as coming up with your judgment. I'm not necessarily saying CLG is better, but that there's an obvious bias in the community that everyone just follows blindly
[3:21:39] pachaa44: @alvbarredo_ lng
[3:21:42] jamesa1121: made that look ez asf
[3:22:20] 21044275: I like the CN casters that cast LCS, I hate the EN LCS casters, same for LPL, I hate CN LPL casters but I like English ones

[3:22:57] 鬼金棒棒: flag
[3:23:11] chilledgh0st: ah ok
[3:23:14] solarflare313: @21044275 I hate lcs casters too, only captain flowers is good
[3:23:25] 21044275: @chilledgh0st So yeah, basically the CN LPL casters are bad and the EN LCS casters are bad
[3:23:31] 燕歸人: BibleThump
[3:23:35] 21044275: So I watch LPL on Twitch and LCS on Huya
[3:23:45] jakiekaxe: jg diff BabyRage
[3:23:51] lancenw: why LPL views so low if their the best region?
[3:23:57] lancenw: genuine question
[3:24:19] multistr1ke: @21044275 Phreak, Kobe and Azael are alright, but the rest is tragic, agree
[3:24:19] jailedmurphy: alistar taking 3 of those kills is a lil rough. omg might not be that far outta the game
[3:24:21] 21044275: All the viewers are concentrated on Douyu, Huya and Bilibili @lancenw
[3:24:22] chilledgh0st: @lancenw cuz they have like 4 other streaming websites that gets 100k viewers
[3:24:25] foreverb0und: 3 0 1 ali 4Head
[3:24:28] jakiekaxe: because twitch is banned in china, they use diff streaming web LUL
[3:24:37] jamesa1121: Ali op

[3:24:47] 21044275: I'm in China right now and accessing Twitch Kappa
[3:24:47] tucoR_: and they dont watch this in english xD
[3:25:01] bmreiblich: US is sleeping twitch banned in China
[3:25:08] FK_P: current champions are Damwon, also western people dislike the chinese and dicksucc koreans
[3:25:16] 2014impimpimp: English viewers arent as familiar with the players and the league, for some reasons they prefer LCK
[3:25:17] l3vi1: viewership is completely irrelevant to being best region. And LPL has the most viewership   of all regions in Chinese websites
[3:25:19] zhuangnauhz: so which can win S11, LCK LPL LEC or LCS?
[3:25:35] hasaki8869: clean
[3:25:36] 21044275: LPL if they find a way to beat DK
[3:25:56] charlesblu: agree
[3:25:57] pablogm8: LCS Keepo @zhuangnauhz

[3:26:01] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[3:26:09] zhuangnauhz: DK is still strong?
[3:26:26] multistr1ke: Yup
[3:26:29] 21044275: It's not that they're strong, it's that they're literally LCK's only threat
[3:26:29] bmreiblich: Strong as a Kia
[3:26:33] multistr1ke: theyre like 13-1 in LCK?
[3:26:47] jailedmurphy: zhuangnauhz, lck and lpl. i think the mythic items are going to highlight the skill gap between NA/euro teams and asian teams.
[3:26:48] l3vi1: Not as strong as last year I guess
[3:26:49] multistr1ke: But yeah, LCK is a one team region. It's DK, and everything below is irrelevant
[3:26:49] solarflare313: @zhuangnauhz cblol will win s11 worlds
[3:26:54] 21044275: If you beat DK, then rest of LCK don't stand a chance against you
[3:27:06] Laviners: BRA71L
[3:27:21] bmreiblich: Stomp
[3:27:27] 21044275: Apart from DK, ONLY good player in LCK is Chovy
[3:27:29] FK_P: damwon 2020 is SSW SKT 2015 IG 2018 tier
[3:27:31] foreverb0und: Hang dominating
[3:27:31] jamesa1121: flash for raptor.... kekw

[3:28:06] multistr1ke: HLE, but purely because Chovy is there.
[3:28:06] chilledgh0st: kr soloq rank 1 is junjia right?

[3:28:41] multistr1ke: wherever*
[3:28:44] chilledgh0st: @21044275 how do you check which player own the acc? I can't see it on opgg
[3:28:50] FK_P: chovy just farms, he puts no pressure
[3:28:54] optisoft: KR = 1 good team , LPL = 2 good teams, LEC = 1 good team, NA = 3 good teams
[3:28:56] 21044275: @chilledgh0st On WeChat
[3:29:04] foreverb0und: chovy just stomped a syndra mid with a renekton lmao what are you talking about
[3:29:13] FK_P: he has good mechanics but can't pure pressure like prime faker did and rookie does
[3:29:15] 21044275: @chilledgh0st There is an app on WeChat that tracks all LPL and LDL pro's KR accounts
[3:29:19] FK_P: put*
[3:29:21] multistr1ke: Imagine thinking that macro play is bad KEKW
[3:29:24] zhuangnauhz: yep  i think chovy is great mid s10
[3:29:27] worlds2024: joel check your wechat
[3:29:35] chilledgh0st: @21044275 I have wechat what's the app called?
[3:29:35] jailedmurphy: T1, DAmwon, griffin are all decent LCK teams
[3:29:37] l3vi1: NA 3 good teams KEKW They are soloQ level
[3:29:46] multistr1ke: I'll take a good macro player over a flashy mechanical one anyday, cause macro never gets outdated and isnt as reliant on numbers balancing
[3:30:04] jailedmurphy: although idk their lineups this season and all new items make it even more unpredictable
[3:30:08] worlds2024: joel check your wechat DansGame
[3:30:10] optisoft: @l3vi1 TSM, 100T, DIGNITAS better than most asian teams
[3:30:22] foreverb0und: chat calls chovy not good their max league are masters or so what
[3:30:30] jailedmurphy: optisoft is on drugs
[3:30:31] jamesa1121: Ace at next drag
[3:30:36] l3vi1: @optisoft They are the best teams ever existed
[3:30:39] multistr1ke: Duh. I mean, they did spend 6 mil on their support KEKW
[3:30:42] lancenw: chat can c9 or tsm compete with any asian teams?
[3:30:47] multistr1ke: And wasnt SwordArt one of the worst supports in LPL anyway?
[3:31:06] solarflare313: LPL and LCK are cool leagues, but they are not the best... you guys need to watch cblol to watch what real peak league of legends looks like
[3:31:08] bmreiblich: Until worlds
[3:31:10] FK_P: I don't need to be the best player in the world to criticize pro players
[3:31:11] optisoft: Aphromoo is a legend and can outplay any asian botlane
[3:31:15] l3vi1: They can compete with OMG
[3:31:28] charlesblu: aphromoo lmfao
[3:31:38] optisoft: NA team Dignitas plays the best league of legends atm, DK and Damwon can't play on that level
[3:31:39] jailedmurphy: lets all be real, HISPANIC league teams are the supreme players
[3:31:46] chilledgh0st: @solarflare313 u mean the wildcard region? LUL

[3:32:42] xeminence: peepoRun
[3:32:47] ksh0863: OMG SO BAD
[3:32:49] xeminence: peepoRun running it down
[3:33:05] FK_P: chovy has perfect predictions, skillshots, reactions and csing, but he would rather farm 5 minions than have kill pressure
