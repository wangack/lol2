[0:15:22] goblinguy01: @hermosilloslayer Na fans are too hard to convert. Eve if LCK drops out of groups, Reddit will claim SKT could smash LPL and NA KEKW

[0:17:09] goblinguy01: People were calling GenG bad in 2018, but not KT for inting against EDG/IG. Hmm bias
[0:17:32] goblinguy01: The LPL is the reason who makes money off their teams - just jealousy mate
[0:17:36] r115r115: KT is not bad that year
[0:17:40] goblinguy01: region*
[0:17:46] r115r115: IG just too strong
[0:17:59] goblinguy01: KT inted against IG in s8 worlds, but IG didn't get their credit....
[0:18:02] hermosilloslayer: i think sn is not the same team without sword
[0:18:39] r115r115: KT is not inted, IG just has more powerful solo lane

[0:19:17] r115r115: nah KT finished 5-1 in group stage
[0:19:32] goblinguy01: NA fans really need to accept that their region is bad since s2 xD
[0:19:45] Riptonn: when does the match start
[0:19:49] goblinguy01: Kt lost to EDG who lost to FNC. KT was bad

[0:23:55] peter_deak: who likes fortnite?
[0:23:57] goblinguy01: TT wins due to memes
[0:23:58] rosina_scarlett: take away G2 from EU

[0:24:07] peter_deak: big TT
[0:24:13] llamapede: 2-0 SN?
[0:24:13] rosina_scarlett: LMAO tsm is freesm
[0:24:22] optisoft: TSM would win LPL
[0:24:55] yourname858619760: CLG would win LPL
[0:24:59] relaxedshet: LGD played good on Worlds. GenG just needs a better toplaner and they will easily go semi's on worlds
[0:25:08] r115r115: HEY , do you guys wtach the MSI new rules, NA is consider the same lv of PCS AND VCS
[0:25:10] xeminence: T_T
[0:25:13] relaxedshet: Ruler easily best adc currently
[0:25:18] rosina_scarlett: that's why tsm got man handled by C9
[0:25:48] goblinguy01: NA has been wildcard since s3? lol. Whats new KEKW
[0:25:50] relaxedshet: Lmao, Rascal is as inconsistent as it gets. How can you not say Ruler is the best of GenG
[0:25:55] Î°§Î©îÏù¥Ï†ÄÌïòÎ¶¨: ResidentSleeper
[0:25:57] r115r115: thats really disrespect to the PCS and VCS

[0:26:14] thatsdanny4u: T1 will win 16-0 on LCS LUL

[0:26:25] r115r115: cant believe NA STILL has 3 TICKETS TO WORLDS, OH ROIT
[0:26:33] TheMegabuster123: rule is geng
[0:26:35] rosina_scarlett: wym i don't watch LCS i only watch LPL and LCK LUL
[0:26:35] relaxedshet: Rascal inconsistent and Clid also not that good atm
[0:26:44] rosina_scarlett: i just look at results
[0:26:52] HalfaXan: Why u talkin then
[0:26:57] spawn_zera: shroudHmm
[0:26:57] goblinguy01: Tencent needs to stop in and remove NA's 3rd spot to WC or LPL/LCK/EU
[0:27:02] rosina_scarlett: bc I know tsm is freesm
[0:27:04] goblinguy01: How about 2 NA teams in play-ins to make it balanced
[0:27:06] thatsdanny4u: Rascal and Clid are doo doo
[0:27:14] HalfaXan: KEKW
[0:27:25] relaxedshet: I mean, current results are most likely not going to mean anything. It's all about summer & worlds 'potential'
[0:27:33] goblinguy01: 10th is solid IG or LNG/Snake
[0:27:38] splintso: rascal is good bdd never shows up internationally
[0:27:49] r115r115: 2 NA in playin is fare, should give the small region more chance
[0:27:49] Zairon: TT Pog
[0:27:51] rosina_scarlett: in that case CLG gonna win worlds 100%
[0:27:57] rosina_scarlett: Kappa
[0:28:10] goblinguy01: Make playins exactly like last years. That was competitive
[0:28:21] relaxedshet: @the_master_splinter, he definitely used to be good. But in past half year Rascal hasnt shown anything
[0:28:29] goblinguy01: Imagine NA having to play 3rd place LPL, 4th EU, and 3rd LCK and Turkiye xD
[0:28:50] thatsdanny4u: T1 will win MSI too garythePog
[0:28:52] relaxedshet: Like, most teams would still beg for a toplaner like Rascal, but compared to the rest of his team hes the weak link imo
[0:29:20] lord999x: Why is this match not in the lolesports website schedule?
[0:29:25] dbloke: :)
[0:29:35] goblinguy01: 2 pods of 6 were a fair chance for all teams.
[0:29:39] HalfaXan: Rascal is just not on form
[0:30:14] TastyAMG: POGGERS
[0:30:30] goblinguy01: highest deaths and kills. Lyrics know how to inflate the numbers
[0:30:57] relaxedshet: I haven't really watched RNG & WE games, but apart from those I think GenG, G2 & FPX have most potential (apart from DK & EDG already being on form)

[0:36:36] HalfaXan: @stackkin yea on his previous team
[0:36:43] noem2k: Ming just needed to have the bigger voice on the team when they had firepower like Uzi
[0:36:51] thug_shaker_o7: 30 mins from now gane starts i think
[0:36:56] epiphanic101: @Zairon He's way overrated

[0:38:34] bling880: nah kiin still best top laner
[0:38:44] Stackkin: Toes
[0:38:52] LoganAUT: @IWasTheChosen 27 mins
[0:38:54] BlueNux: Ya Suning will get back on their horse. Spring doesn't matter too much anyway
[0:38:58] epiphanic101: Morgan best toplaner
[0:39:03] BlueNux: Plus they will inevitably have to adjust after losing a key member
[0:39:14] noem2k: who cares about kiin, hed rather stay stuck on an irrelevant org than achieve anything in LCK
[0:39:17] ayaya_lord_of_weebs: Does G2 have a chance?
[0:39:50] shinwinter: I'm like TT just like TT Ireon nae mam moreugo neomuhae neomuhae
[0:39:54] qaqlsq: LUL
[0:39:55] BlueNux: I haven't watched much pro scene this year, how is LCK looking? Is everyone outside of DWG crap again?

[0:40:06] relaxedshet: @ayaya_lord_of_weebs, wdym where and when

[0:40:40] BlueNux: Who is DK?
[0:40:40] relaxedshet: current G2 vs LPL/LCK top teams no chance
[0:40:47] ayaya_lord_of_weebs: @relaxedshet not a fan of g2 just asking
[0:40:56] 4ernio: GivePLZ
[0:40:56] Zairon: BlueNux damwon renamed to damwon kia
[0:41:01] epiphanic101: @electricdreeg Having the same dominant performance so far then yes, it's very likely
[0:41:03] BlueNux: Oh lol
[0:41:05] relaxedshet: but I hope G2 will improve and have a chance for worlds
[0:41:13] noem2k: there is an alternate reality for every possible outcome in this world
[0:41:19] Grindaviisan: 2015 SKT T1 will come back and win
[0:41:39] BlueNux: Well, usually world champions look sharp all the way until around mid season, then sometimes struggle later (IG, FPX)
[0:41:43] Zairon: lol T1 aint gonna do anything this split
[0:41:57] PosAlCapone: After 6 yers?lmao
[0:42:01] BlueNux: I'm guessing DWG will too. Hard to stay on top and it's probably exhausting as all hell nowadays to stay on top
[0:42:10] ayaya_lord_of_weebs: @zairon as a T1 fan i agree wholeheartedly
[0:42:11] thatsdanny4u: @Zairon you sure bout that?  Kappa
[0:42:23] epiphanic101: T1's last game was just outright trolling, most of the trolling was Clozer's
[0:42:23] noem2k: what is the point in still using faker what does he have to offer the team
[0:42:25] irlgigachad: viper has the clutch carry star imo
[0:42:35] Grindaviisan: they will if their 2015 team comes back KEKW
[0:42:38] irlgigachad: he isn't recognized as it yet, but this year he's rising to that
[0:42:44] relaxedshet: Viper inted hard yesterday tho KEKW
[0:42:44] epiphanic101: @noem2k Did you even see their last game?
[0:42:52] BlueNux: @noem2k Nostalgia and viewership. He hasn't been competitive as the best mid for years now
[0:42:52] Tysah_: TT wins 2-1
[0:43:02] noem2k: @epiphanic101 did you see their last 10 games?
[0:43:25] BlueNux: @relaxedshet Way way waaaaay too early for that. People were saying that about Kanavi and then look what happened gradually over the entire year
[0:43:48] AFKennedy69: JKL KEKW
[0:43:52] epiphanic101: @noem2k I did, and Faker didn't choke a 1v1 and didn't just murder his entire team
[0:43:55] BlueNux: Spring rarely every indicates anything for rest of the year
[0:44:06] relaxedshet: I'm assuming thats not meant for me xd
[0:44:22] SensualCharmm: LUL
[0:44:28] AFKennedy69: No one cares about spring, SN was trash in spring and went to finals
[0:44:31] SensualCharmm: LUL w
[0:44:33] BlueNux: Oh no I meant the other guy above you
[0:44:34] noem2k: @epiphanic101 'he didn't choke'. thats the standard you have for this player now?
[0:44:39] BlueNux: Stupid chat moved while I clicked reply lol
[0:45:04] relaxedshet: Ye I also said it like 20 min ago that no world champion ever dominated in spring. Summer much better indicator
[0:45:07] irlgigachad: yeah but is sn the exception or the rule, unsure how many teams just surge from summer to spring that hard through the years
[0:45:17] epiphanic101: @noem2k It's a standard if you singlehandedly made your team lose when you were brought on the main roster, because well, that's the point
[0:45:18] BlueNux: Last year this time people were still sleeping on Suning, especially how Bin and Huanfeng developed
[0:45:20] IHavePotential: How long for game to start?
[0:45:21] relaxedshet: Even DK last year 9-9 Spring split
[0:45:38] AFKennedy69: FPX and IG didnt win spring in 18-19 either
[0:45:40] noem2k: @epiphanic101 you dont need to reply to everything just for the sake of replying. just take the L
[0:45:40] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish

[0:45:52] hermosilloslayer: almost palt 4 guys
[0:45:52] Stackkin: Who won worlds ?
[0:45:59] BlueNux: A smart team would take it easy during Spring, focus on making playoffs, then really ramp it up in summer onwards
[0:46:00] Stackkin: LAst year
[0:46:03] kkristheman86: TSM won worlds
[0:46:06] epiphanic101: @noem2k DId you even say anything? KEKW
[0:46:10] SensualCharmm: LUL
[0:46:11] BlueNux: Especially for LPL and LCK teams - they're there to win worlds for realsies
[0:46:13] Linkbane: KEKW
[0:46:19] N3WTYPE01: KEKW
[0:46:25] darkgreed0: hi all
[0:46:26] Stackkin: who did they play
[0:46:36] HalfaXan: KEKWait
[0:46:41] rinbunbun: IG in spring 2018 was dominant but when it came playoff LUL
[0:46:46] Stackkin: SN beat tes lol
[0:46:48] BlueNux: How do you expect Suning to stay on top after a grueling 2020 AND losing their star support?
[0:46:51] thug_shaker_o7: gg won worlds 2021 Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:47:00] BlueNux: They have reasons to go on vacation mode for a split
[0:47:02] kkristheman86: Doublelift pentakill every game and TSM 15-0 in worlds legend.
[0:47:19] epiphanic101: @kkristheman86 SeemsGood
[0:47:21] Stackkin: Which beat league to watch right now?
[0:47:25] Stackkin: Best
[0:47:30] BlueNux: If I just spend 15 hours a day practicing and competing last year, I'm taking a breather in and getting my int out of the way this split lol
[0:47:44] SensualCharmm: LUL LUL LUL
[0:47:54] kkristheman86: We are living in the TSM era
[0:47:56] Stackkin: LPL most kills?
[0:48:00] AFKennedy69: If TES represent the LPL is MSI then gg DK easy trophy
[0:48:13] BlueNux: Is NA good this year? Competitive against LCK LPL and LEC?
[0:48:16] relaxedshet: @stackkin, LPL is most random, but if 'best' you mean quality LCK imo
[0:48:25] noem2k: NA is very good
[0:48:31] kristers_229: @BlueNux ofc not
[0:48:39] epiphanic101: Does anyone know how many teams are allowed from each region in MSI?
[0:48:45] relaxedshet: NA is a joke and will always be
[0:49:05] InstaRewind: hi
[0:49:09] BlueNux: @AFKennedy69 No guarantees. I can see them flop too. Been watching pro LOL for too long and have seen teams like ROX, IG, RNG etc collapse HARD when you least expect them to
[0:49:11] SensualCharmm: loeyaKEKW
[0:49:13] AFKennedy69: This year NA is exceptional Kappa like look at DIG smurfing the league. They would easily destroy those asian teams
[0:49:27] SensualCharmm: loeyaKEKW loeyaKEKW
[0:49:33] relaxedshet: As long as like Diamond on NA is comparable to Gold in Korea, that says enough about NA talent pool LUL
[0:49:47] Shurukkah: @BlueNux Just watch Caedrel and you will find out yourself
[0:49:47] BlueNux: I read that TSM pays their team over $8mm!?!?!?!?
[0:49:52] BlueNux: Is that true?
[0:49:56] araveus: rogue?
[0:50:07] InstaRewind: it doesnt matter about the average player it matters about what the best of the best can do in each region @relaxedshet
[0:50:08] HalfaXan: Rouge
[0:50:08] CloudOnSaturn: FNC arent making worlds tho KEKW
[0:50:15] irlgigachad: if swordart gets 6 mil makes sense its that high
[0:50:21] BlueNux: @Shurukkah What should I search on YouTube?
[0:50:22] thug_shaker_o7: @bluenux 6 ml support ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:50:44] ToTFlame: 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred
[0:50:48] BlueNux: Hard for me to get into pro LOL again... Always the same result. LPL and LCK win in the end, with a few LEC results sprinkled in :(
[0:50:51] AFKennedy69: G2 are looking better than last year people should stop underrating them but yes EDG-RNG would beat them
[0:50:54] SensualCharmm: Wtf
[0:51:01] InstaRewind: is swordartonline the best support in the world?
[0:51:06] relaxedshet: @instarewind, the way the ranked system is designed (its relative performance) it means that the best % in korea is much better than the best % in NA
[0:51:12] noem2k: reverse sweepng FNC didnt take discipline. it just took half a brain to abuse nemesis
[0:51:22] curl_connoisseur: whens the game start
[0:51:32] Stackkin: 14 min
[0:51:44] Shurukkah: @BlueNux Caedrel TSM vs 100T review
[0:51:54] BlueNux: @relaxedshet True, but I also think the difference near the top become very minimal once you put them in a team environment. Otherwise LPL would be much much stronger relatively
[0:51:54] InstaRewind: @relaxedshet yeah i guess but NA has some incredibly good players who stomp on korean pros
[0:52:03] bedbugking_: Shit which match was the one before this
[0:52:08] Fersheii: do the candles look forward to being used?
[0:52:10] milesgemboa: do you guys think tt wins a game in this series
[0:52:11] relaxedshet: @relaxedshet, of course not science, but one can assume that it follows a normal distribution
[0:52:17] noem2k: why dont these guys mention NA.
[0:52:26] BlueNux: NA just collapses mentally. I mean even between NA teams, there's no reason C9 continuously overperforms TL and TSM. Half their failures are due to poor mental and team culture
[0:52:28] Fersheii: cuz na is a joke
[0:52:35] AFKennedy69: This chat before the games starts is great, why does it turn so bad later on KEKW
[0:52:37] amaranthyaeger: NA isn't worth mentioning.
[0:52:45] YSoWavy9: @milesgemboa if they don't throw for sure, so definitely not PepeLaugh
[0:52:49] CurrerBell7: imagine being caster in LPL and trying to predict LUL
[0:52:53] hermosilloslayer: na this year is so random
[0:52:57] thatsdanny4u: whens the game ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:52:59] relaxedshet: Idk, the iron people feel more prevalent during games FeelsBadMan
[0:53:06] hellosputnik: 60 ms ping NA can never be a serious region
[0:53:16] marketdome: T-T
[0:53:18] Stackkin: SN
[0:53:20] Sov25: @BlueNux Well C9 typically performed better internationally because they didn't rely on winning lanes to gain advantages. TSM/TL historically have usually got leads from lane kingdom
[0:53:27] BlueNux: Can someone tell me who TT is?
[0:53:28] Tysah_: TT wins 2-1
[0:53:35] marketdome: (T.T)
[0:53:40] bedbugking_: @noem2k I think they just keep faker around for people like me who just like him even if he may not be the ebst f
[0:53:42] rinbunbun: TES Chokers LUL

[0:53:48] CurrerBell7: Rookie and Knight isn‚Äôt performing amazing as they were last year BibleThump
[0:53:50] BlueNux: TT must be new team. I don't remember that acronym
[0:53:52] Stackkin: Silly
[0:54:03] thatsdanny4u: TES 2020 > TES 2021
[0:54:09] Stackkin: SN JUS 2-0 IG

[0:54:26] HalfaXan: Let‚Äôs do some tequila
[0:54:27] Tysah_: I bet $125 on TT easy 2-1 win
[0:54:30] Stackkin: 11min
[0:54:34] BlueNux: @CurrerBell7 They'll step it up in summer split. These dudes prob coast in Spring or play 90%. Pro life is tiring as shit. Why burn out starting so early
[0:54:37] Tysah_: @the_phene 10 minutes till draft
[0:54:40] The_Phene: Ty
[0:54:47] Stackkin: Cancel bet

[0:57:30] Sov25: TES def was the most overrated team in 2020

[0:57:38] Munchables: THE VIBES
[0:57:38] ssunndayy: F PX

[0:57:47] Sov25: G2 #4

[0:57:56] Fiiisch100: 10 and lower
[0:58:01] relaxedshet: FNC is so bad atm xd
[0:58:03] thug_shaker_o7: @munchables Kappa Kappa
[0:58:04] hellosputnik: TES and JDG were kinda both disappointing at Worlds
[0:58:14] miemieyama: no, f is for friends who do stuff together
[0:58:14] hellosputnik: I thought they would've been like untouchable
[0:58:14] Rallihood: this is prerecorded?
[0:58:15] SensualCharmm: Pog
[0:58:15] m3phyy: when is the game?
[0:58:20] relaxedshet: I'd put G2 4th atm as well. But they can definitely improve
[0:58:22] HalfaXan: G2 on second
[0:58:24] Munchables: F is for friends who do stuff together
[0:58:25] Excomm: 4, 8, 16 LUL
[0:58:28] CurrerBell7: love your casting @hystericscasts
[0:58:31] Munchables: U IS FOR U AND MEEEE
[0:58:37] rinbunbun: TES & JDG choked compared to thier summer performance LUL
[0:58:38] HystericsCasts: love you @CurrerBell7
[0:58:41] noktuk_: When does the game start?
[0:58:45] noem2k: no way to know until they play
[0:58:46] ayaya_lord_of_weebs: @munchables N IS FOR ANYWHERE
[0:58:51] BlueNux: Boys, I actually made myself a mixed drink since we were talking about tequila shots
[0:58:55] relaxedshet: Rogue might actually be #1 or #2 in LPL
[0:58:56] scottoflorida2014: LEC LUL  Same record in finals as NA  zero wins
[0:58:57] BlueNux: Sip one for the boys!
[0:59:01] Î°§Î©îÏù¥Ï†ÄÌïòÎ¶¨: LUL
[0:59:15] Munchables: @ayaya_lord_of_weebs and anytime at all!
[0:59:17] duduuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu: lol i want to see EDG vs FPX probably the best teams in lpl rn
[0:59:22] scottoflorida2014: G2 RGE would be competing with RW or TT
[0:59:28] relaxedshet: Rogue's consistency is soo good. They are just not good in playoffs/stage performance
[0:59:29] noem2k: RGE needs to expand their playstyle still
[0:59:31] goblinguy01: I hope we one day swap top teams for the LPL and LCK.
[0:59:33] bedbugking_: @bluenux why not just have a full pint? The boys wont mind
[0:59:37] Sov25: Tbh FNC would prob have the best chance in LPL. G2 are like 1-6 with their core lineup vs LPL teams.
[0:59:42] BlueNux: Wait wait wait, Rogue is good this year in LEC!?
[0:59:48] goblinguy01: That would help teams build confidence and playstyles. xD
[0:59:48] BlueNux: As in top of the standings good?
[0:59:51] Mini_0v0: SN 2:0 BloodTrail
[0:59:52] scottoflorida2014: LUL 4th
[0:59:53] bedbugking_: Yep
[0:59:58] goblinguy01: Imagine DamWon in the LPL
[0:59:58] relaxedshet: FNC best chance? xD FNC is actually bad af
[1:00:02] styxx92: @bluenux yes
[1:00:03] LmaoLp: @Munchables one thing glossed over, lpl plays 16 bo3's, lec teams would giga struggle with that schedule especially to the latter end
[1:00:04] Semaka13: @BlueNux surprisingly solid
[1:00:12] relaxedshet: @bluenux, Yes, dont be surprised if RGE win split
[1:00:13] styxx92: @bluenux they are 11-2
[1:00:13] ooczzy: the right caster looks like jacksepticeye
[1:00:23] Sov25: I wish LPL did 10-12 teams and double round robin
[1:00:23] scottoflorida2014: G2 fans LUL  Then they pull a TSM and choke every year
[1:00:25] goblinguy01: Rogue isn't beating IG KEKW
[1:00:26] wumbc: TT 2:0 ez
[1:00:28] rinbunbun: Has G2 even won against IG since 2018 ResidentSleeper
[1:00:32] styxx92: Just like G2 right now, 1st ex aequo
[1:00:32] bedbugking_: @ooczzy i dont see it

[1:00:39] BlueNux: Holy shit hype. Will be only first time except Alliance that a non-G2/FNC wins Europe right?
[1:00:42] relaxedshet: I doubt u guys even watch RGE. They are actually very solid
[1:00:43] Munchables: @LmaoLp Idk if it's fair to say they'd struggle, i think a lot of the teams would prefer it
[1:00:57] itraacer: SN or IG first?
[1:00:58] goblinguy01: G2 can only take 1 game off LPL teams since s8. They took a game off Suning off a throw
[1:01:02] ooczzy: @bedbugking_ i cant unsee it smh
[1:01:02] itraacer: i want to back to sleep
[1:01:05] bedbugking_: Game starting?
[1:01:06] Mini_0v0: SN
[1:01:10] epiphanic101: @relaxedshet Against bottom tier teams
[1:01:13] relaxedshet: @bluenux, they first have to prove themselves in playoffs. Which is usually the problem for such teams
[1:01:21] thug_shaker_o7: Kappa Kappa frist eu team for worlds op fnc now peepe fnc ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:01:21] scottoflorida2014: G2 is where they should be, minor region like EU/NA
[1:01:22] BlueNux: V5! V5! V5! V5!!!!!
[1:01:24] hellosputnik: How many teams play in the playoff?
[1:01:28] goblinguy01: Lyric the IG and V5 fanboi xD
[1:01:33] LmaoLp: @Munchables they'd probably prefer it, but it still has a major adjustment time required to get used to while maintaining scrim times etc
[1:01:35] HalfaXan: Kappa
[1:01:36] LaidToRest454: How long till game starts?
[1:01:40] itraacer: 10
[1:01:41] bedbugking_: @relaxedshet i beleive they can tbh, on a but of a
[1:01:43] BlueNux: @relaxedshet True... Championship mentality is a very real thing in competition
[1:01:46] Sov25: G2 1-7 vs LPL teams since caps joined.
[1:01:47] noem2k: @scottoflorida2014 and you're where you should be.
[1:01:48] HystericsCasts: Dagda is a fan Pog

[1:02:28] Jesss19: HeyGuys AYAYA
[1:02:28] relaxedshet: In my opinion LPL isn't as good this year. Many throws/ fiesta's and non-clean plays. EDG is one of the cleaner teams, which is why they will beat RGE
[1:02:28] scottoflorida2014: Nobody is going to beat LPL or LCK

[1:02:54] Laviners: "G2 would be a middle team in LPL" KEKW this is laughable on its face. Middle teams in LPL consists of the likes of JDG, Suning and IG, teams 10 levels above that of G2. I know youre a delusional fanstraight, but there HAS to be limits on how delusional you can be
