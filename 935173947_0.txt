[3:52:50] Zairon: alucard166510 yeah it's because NA doesnt promote talent and orgs are horrible at scouting, thus they just pay huge sums for imports who then underperform because they have bad coaching etc.

[3:54:11] Êï∞Â≠¶ÂÆ∂: @Zairon Kind of strange to say that. The reason talent isn't as great in NA is simply because there are degrees of magnitude less players. The ladder isn't as competitive, so the best aren't as good. Simple

[4:00:56] Slowacki: @yudai95 quick clear
[4:01:01] Adiction7: @yudai95 Because LoL told people to stop picking the same 10 champs
[4:01:06] Piezo: @yudai95 supposed to be an udyr counter if u get through the earlygame jungling but beishang wrecked him on his first clear
[4:01:14] nexiro: @yudai95 he clears close to as fast as udyr, is tankier, provides the same in team fights (big frontline) only difference is that udyr ganks better in the early
[4:01:18] ZeeRee686: give the left dude a 2 week vacation, he needs it real bad
[4:01:34] yudai95: k
[4:01:35] AJVK47: I have morning wood
[4:01:43] yudai95: so mundo > udyr
[4:01:47] Zairon: MsPokerLoL why do you look at it from such a one dimensional angle... NA soloq is far worse because the top teams import players instead of develop talent and scout for players. So of course there will be less interest for players to grind soloqueue if they think an import wil get picked over them anyway
[4:01:48] constandinos8: @The_Master_Splinter i dont know what EU did to you but you are in pain i can see
[4:02:29] Zairon: MsPokerLoL there is a multitude of reasons why NA teams always fail internationally and pale in comparison to each other major region not just playerbase.
[4:02:29] nexiro: @yudai95 not exactly, udyr is better in the early whereas mundo is better in teamfights as a beefy frontline
[4:02:45] alucard4524: i didnt say that
[4:02:49] Êï∞Â≠¶ÂÆ∂: @Zairon You know, the logic isn't unique to League. You also learn this in business when it comes to job applicants. The more applicants, the more likely you will have a skilled employee.
[4:02:55] yudai95: yeah but mundo doesnt have same speeed as udyr

[4:03:18] Piezo: i blame pyosik for all the weird jungle picks
[4:03:34] Zachary_Blobman: @Zairon talent is developed in solo queue. LPL and LCK find talent in solo queue. Solo queue is where you learn mechanics

[4:04:34] mrinterpret: Lol
[4:04:38] Doughy12: na won't win worlds until they buy an entire korean/chinese team and go bankrupt
[4:04:46] nexiro: @epiphanic101 mundo is beefier in a lot of ways for example his ultimate, udyrs stun is close to useless in a teamfight cause he cant get to the backline if frontline plays properly
[4:04:49] SneckyValorant: trash lgd

[4:06:40] epiphanic101: @Nixorixi But Mundo has conditional speed, and the extra beefiness isn't that important if your whole team is dead. Other than the low damage there's not much that would make the enemy team focus a frontline Mundo

[4:42:52] ulsankate05: Fnatic with YC is pretty cool may be win the worlds
[4:43:03] Zairon: Nuguri imo far better player than Khan so DK got downgrade in toplane and also lost Keria. They are still strong but overall not as strong as their previous lineup
[4:43:11] FK_P: but TES beat Fnatic and G2 got stomped by DWG?
[4:43:13] Zairon: oh keria drx im sry
