[1:43:02] maul467: Why did lilia go lianfrys and not moonstone?
[1:43:07] ye1l: I'm convinced that FPX could make any jungler look good because of their playstyle. Like tell me you wouldn't be playing with confidence if you knew that both Doinb and Crisp will do everything in their power to help you win
[1:43:07] synthpopthot: fpx were considering starting prince for 3 lck
[1:43:17] noem2k: yes doinb is a japanese resident
[1:43:21] TrollManAre: XIAOHU is just better doinb
[1:43:22] SirGarland: 16th LPL > 1st LCS
[1:43:25] Racer7807: You play teamfights fast as RNG so moonstone has far less value
[1:43:37] TheOreoCupcake: Oh shit

[1:46:01] Munchables: People brainwashed by IG in chat smh
[1:46:01] TrollManAre: But what does she do for rng
[1:46:02] ziosevielspezel: if shy gets on form ig will be contenders
[1:46:03] bossnno: @TexasRaiderZ pure mechanics wise doinb isnt even top 5 in cn, but the way he plays isnt relying on that. doinb plays like a second support so its not surprising he doesnt look like hes popping off
[1:46:08] maul467: @trollmanare was prob 1st pick
[1:46:12] Munchables: Me, an intellectual: brainwashed by TES

[2:06:48] ye1l: @theoreocupcake my point is that Pantheon was versatile precisely because he was strong from a very early level and didn't lose lane, like sett in 2020 and gragas now.
[2:07:07] RealGuldborg: Bring Mikuya!!

[2:08:04] ye1l: Champs like Pantheon, sett and gragas was good because there's no definite answer to them. you can pick them early without ever worrying about a counter pick.
[2:08:18] chilledgh0st: I would prefer mikuya instead of ale but tbf lng has toplane problems like blg
[2:08:27] ye1l: Viego gets rolled by GP/Irelia and some other champs

[2:08:41] ye1l: Ale is much more talented than. M1kuya

[2:08:49] using_user: Speaking of Ale, why doesn't that Chines beer company advertise on here anymore?
[2:08:53] ziosevielspezel: viego not viable in pro play
[2:08:55] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l Weak early game isn't end all now. Viego definitely has counters in lane but if given the opportunity, he'd be a menace later on. Scaling is much more prevelant now than before.
[2:09:08] RealGuldborg: M1kuya > Ale
[2:09:17] tha_black_beetle: viego is viable in jungle vs weaker champions. If viego is able to scale he becomes rediculous

[2:31:39] dpevo16: How many of those sleep lullaby bubbles does Lillia have
[2:31:42] L0w0ctane: I believe RNG can win late game cause LNG will throw KappaPride
