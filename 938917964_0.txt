[3:19:11] RedShroomish: ResidentSleeper
[3:19:16] northern_light_5: @kayonas my accusation ofc, is suspicion here. But as tied up with LGD's reputation and past history with being one of the biggest match fixer in LDL doesnt make them innocent and cleared of suspicion
[3:19:23] hugo_zanata: FREE MONEY
[3:19:28] chilledgh0st: @sanitycheck833 so ur saying lgd is probably the team that would match fix out of all teams?
[3:19:37] fast_turtle15: I lost a bet BabyRage match fix BabyRage
[3:19:51] kayonas: @sanitycheck833 there is more evidence of lng match fixing here than lgd.. lol i dont think you get how betting works

[3:19:59] semandemon22: No. He said they are the biggest match fish f team. No speculation yhere
[3:20:04] hsuchihmo: FPX vs 6win streaks RA monkaMEGA
