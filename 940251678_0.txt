[3:09:02] Cinamo2: Esports are bought by organizations that don’t represent anything. If these teams represented people and districts they would be much more criticized and pressured to actually care. Also esports are still relatively new so they don’t got it right just yet

[4:36:06] cymbiline: the shy will for sure be featured in first blood - whether thats dying or doing the killing LUL
[4:36:09] kkristheman86: Rookie beats knight usually. I hope that's now the case today
[4:36:10] ultranovel: theshyt KEKW
[4:36:17] r115r115: JKL the traitor slayed IG or IG defense the villiage
[4:36:21] kkristheman86: not the case
[4:36:27] bbrrosseeantt: Telecom1 more like Telecom entertainment LUL
[4:36:28] K4polo: TES 2-0 but TES still free to NA teams.
[4:36:33] ITryNotNow: why so much hype around theshy every game?
[4:36:42] marcos397: Lul just entered and I thought they were Yamato and Deficio XD
[4:36:53] kiivfps: @itrynotnow, he was good 2-3 years ago and people are still hyped from that
[4:37:04] cymbiline: theshy is coin flip player, so no matter how he does hes fun to watch for me
[4:37:26] isararaa: IG will stomp or get stomped
[4:37:30] nien23832: 8039 LUL

[4:37:40] r115r115: the shy still better than 369
[4:37:40] splintso: no player has the celing and the basement of TheShy
[4:37:46] xeminence: IG vs TES? PauseChamp
[4:37:51] Fyrixia: Similar to whole IG really aside from Rookie
[4:37:53] UwUUwUmi: ALL LANE DIFF LULW
[4:37:59] Yakuzazx: So tes 2 - 0 then ?
[4:38:07] isararaa: Hopefully rookie has a good performance today
[4:38:09] HolidayRX: IG WIN 2-0
[4:38:10] legendrui11: @ITryNotNow Theshy or Theshyt, there is no in-between. Thats why he gets so hyped.
[4:38:11] K4polo: @The_Master_Splinter I would say Huni but he gets more of the basement for the coin flips. LOL
[4:38:20] BlankTheDankTwitch: whats with the teemo ban, was blg just flexing?
[4:38:21] ultranovel: HUNI KEKW
[4:38:36] ultranovel: HUni will never reach theshy heigh lol KEKW
[4:38:40] splintso: @K4poloX yeah TheShy is uber Huni
[4:38:43] jamespac123: @K4poloX huni? KEKW

[4:39:03] cymbiline: also literally last split he was 1st all pro lol, this narrative of theshy being shit since worlds was dumb
[4:39:11] bbrrosseeantt: NA import more like washed up LUL
[4:39:12] SirGarland: Rookie 1v9 RuleFive
[4:39:23] 재욱챠: Im korean hi'n
[4:39:24] K4polo: is IG still Rookie 1 v 9 team?
[4:39:24] TES__JackeyLove: Kappa
[4:39:25] r115r115: IG:we gonna destroy the traitor today   JKL:gonna destroy the 4 traitor today
[4:39:37] Fyrixia: @cymbiline I think it's just cause the games he runs down are very memorable unfortunately for him
[4:39:51] SirGarland: 100T need a new Midlaner (Asian) LUL
[4:39:57] ultranovel: @K4poloX no their supp and jungle are consistent.Lucas is so much better than baolan
[4:40:08] legendrui11: finally new patch
[4:40:18] splintso: Huni has a crazy ceiling but he can be the best top ever for 1 play then 30min of the worst
[4:40:20] bbrrosseeantt: @ultranovel overall karsa > xun
[4:40:25] cymbiline: it be like it do @Fyrixia
[4:40:27] Fyrixia: I am worried about IG botlane though but hopefully they prove me wrong
[4:40:28] kylldeth: @cymbiline you obviously have not watched IG during playoffs, or even regular season. TheShy being 1st all pro is a troll, because LPL all pro is an popularity contest
[4:40:35] jamespac123: there are some na player palying in na?

[4:42:16] Yakuzazx: so IG or TES lads
[4:42:28] K4polo: TES lost to NA team too.
[4:42:28] Fyrixia: @lakdkdkd They did win that set mainly through bot diff this season I'd argue Tes botlane is better
[4:42:31] r115r115: cant wait to see JKL kill all his former teammate
[4:42:36] ljpnb66: Wendy pog

[4:44:03] SirGarland: Rookie and TheShy vs JKL, TATAKAE GlitchNRG
[4:44:12] cymbiline: i predict that if ig does well today they will be swiftly stomped by whatever low ranked team they play next
[4:44:20] ljpnb66: Lck or lpl choose
[4:44:21] cymbiline: it'll be fun either way lol
[4:44:35] r115r115: lck didnt win a single bo5 in international vs lpl or lec except DK
