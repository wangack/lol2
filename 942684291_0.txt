[1:41:52] cthorrez: @jamespac123 At the end of the day each view is a person who is choosing to watch. Generally people choose to watch out of some sense of enjoyment. More people choose to watch -> it is more enjoayable to the fan base on average.
[1:41:56] efusy: @certainlysomeonehere To be fair a distinction has to be made. Obviously the LPL will be more popular in raw viewers cause China's population is immense. Foreign viewer count is, imo, a good measurement of how interesting a league is in general.

[4:34:32] LoganAUT: @ShadowMuur giving up part ownership of one of the biggest esport organizations for increased playing time doesnt sound very smart tbh
[4:35:02] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: i hope all regions thrive in order to create more competitive and professional gameplay because i am a mature adult POGGERS

[4:35:23] Orkx10: ShadowMuur faker was offered a "blank check" to come to na right? or I'm i tripping
[4:35:25] ShadowMuur: @LoganAUT He's not in the sport for ownership, he's a player, players want to win. When SKT won with Easyhoon and he wasn't playing, he said himself. He didn't like it. He wants to be the best and win. Not be in the background
[4:35:25] HelloKomodo: @LoganAUT Faker is his own walking brand. He doesn't need part ownership to be successful
