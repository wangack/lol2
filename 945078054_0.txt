[3:09:32] papakyrie: Who sleeps die
[3:09:35] ye1l: @templarianz Gangplank doesn't take turrets exceptionally quickly and Sion can 1v1 him comfortably, he wont be a threat like a Camille or Jax could be
[3:09:37] austinzangg: @Munchables is that suning emote?

[3:12:32] ye1l: @vellrus Either they run a full on poke comp with jayce top and an enchanter supp that can top them of or they run a 4-1 where their sidelaner can actually threaten objectives
[3:12:44] ye1l: @vellrus not just indefinitely ping-ponging waves
[3:12:50] nanoide1: @semandemon22 okey bro relax xd
[3:13:11] ye1l: @vellrus Because that achieves nothing as WE massively outscales because of the 5v5
