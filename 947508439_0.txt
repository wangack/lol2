[7:40:32] lvnza: @takesusanoonomikoto not lane wise but in teamfights it was constantly his engages stupid, he was the only one that still picked wukong during worlds and he constantly shut down the carries every teamfight thats why they won

[7:44:25] Aruru_Kun: peepoHey
[7:44:26] bejitaka: DID TOP WIN?
[7:44:28] hardstuck_dad: @lvnza Whatever dude. You did say he did SHT on every toplaner. Which implyed in LANE.
[7:44:31] lvnza: @takesusanoonomikoto go back to NA
[7:44:44] seraphnz: catJAM
[7:44:49] lvnza: @takesusanoonomikoto lol demolish toplaner because he outexecutes them in teamfights
[7:45:03] lvnza: @takesusanoonomikoto and its even called a 0/2 power spike
[7:45:16] Wesselch: pepeD
[7:45:29] hardstuck_dad: @lvnza Teamfights legit means zero, when Zoom is the only JDG member entering them not from a massive deficit
[7:45:30] ga2006187329: catJAM
[7:45:30] lvnza: @takesusanoonomikoto because toplaners are obviously always left alone thats why their teamfight impact has to be better
