[2:08:10] templariantv: @MitskiOfTheLeaf You are talking about NA on LPL stream? PepeLaugh
[2:08:22] DictatorDuck: there are plenty of high skill champs that see play, the rest just aren't good enough for pro play
[2:08:24] MitskiOfTheLeaf: im talking about all regions
[2:08:28] SOMAlul: @mitskioftheleaf having NA as a standard

[2:08:45] MitskiOfTheLeaf: LCK LPL LEC NA they all play easy champs
[2:08:49] K4polo: Why does no one talk about OMG in LPL?
[2:09:08] MitskiOfTheLeaf: yeah they care aout winning so they play easy champs instead of getting good at the skilled champs
[2:09:10] Mecedu: objectively wrong but alas
[2:09:17] SOMAlul: what are the hard to play champs for you @mitskioftheleaf
[2:09:17] fenghuang20: ???
[2:09:22] papayasmithy: OMG not worth talking about rn
[2:09:26] Doki__Doki: players don't master champions because you need a high amount of time, so they just try to go 3-4 champions
[2:09:30] Mecedu: that makes no sense, if one champ is strong in meta they will learn it
[2:09:34] mparmpabrillios: LEONA E KEKW

[2:10:41] ImSumWhatMad: If you just go comfort picks all the time, you lose. Teams adapt to you. The players havd to adapt to the meta. It just happens that right now the meta is extremely stale.
[2:10:44] fenghuang20: LUL tristana
[2:10:47] wimpodwarden: see i think each pro knows how t9 play most of thier lanes champs its just if they are good at it
[2:10:50] ImSumWhatMad: It's not always as stale as it is now
[2:10:54] MitskiOfTheLeaf: i rarely play league these days but hard champs i did play was thresh but hes the only real one that takes skill for support wise. honestly thresh prob the only skilled champ in support
[2:11:20] ImSumWhatMad: Lol thresh is the only skilled support. Okay
[2:11:25] harangui7575: @k4polox nope
[2:11:33] Mecedu: very clear you dont play league anymore
[2:11:34] ImSumWhatMad: Interesting opinion
[2:11:34] Doki__Doki: honestly i don't see meta being stale, the items help a lot in you building differently, its just that you see someone use Azir one time and everyone uses it, there are better champions than Azir FailFish
[2:12:06] PeshMesh: @Doki__Doki meta is legit control mages mid and tanks/gnar top,it is very stale
[2:12:08] richearth101: ??
[2:12:13] fiendssword: lmfao
[2:12:23] K4polo: I honestly surprised Udyr survive the nerf bat and is still a top tier Jungler lol
[2:12:24] ImSumWhatMad: Yeah Doki I think that's one of the confusing things to me. They pick the same Champs every time even if they aren't performing well. It's so weird
[2:12:29] SOMAlul: @peshmesh then Lucian is a Control mage?
[2:12:31] MitskiOfTheLeaf: but you can see in this match its mostly easy champs. Sion Gnar Udyr Galio Trist Alistar and Leona. Syndra and nidalee atleast takes some skill here
[2:12:31] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[2:12:42] PeshMesh: @SOMAlul wow 1 exception

[2:13:24] ImSumWhatMad: I wouldn't call Leona or Udyr "easy." I mean playing at a high level, I don't think any champ is necessary easy
[2:13:26] papayasmithy: udyr is picked because of clearspeed and item abuse, not because hes easy

[2:13:39] fuwuzzyhamster: This is why Dota2 is the better game

[2:14:31] ImSumWhatMad: Also what skill does Syndra take? Pressing the R button? woah, huge skill
[2:14:41] Mecedu: if you think leona in pro play is just hur dur engage now you dont know pro play
[2:14:53] papayasmithy: what even are "hard" champs
[2:15:00] Doki__Doki: "gnar is meta guys" gnar just lost
[2:15:02] fast_turtle15: lol have people not seen the best syndra players utilize her
[2:15:04] kekwait12322: gnar?
[2:15:07] MitskiOfTheLeaf: pro play is stupid. they play champs like gnar. its garbage in pro play

[2:15:28] ImSumWhatMad: Gnar is meta for literally no reason. It's not even good
[2:15:38] Mecedu: its not hard to play if you are playing against plats in soloq

[2:15:55] g0vernor69: Ls fans are early in twitch chat here it seems
[2:16:02] Mecedu: it doesnt matter the champ skill cap if your oponents know how to fight against you

[2:16:50] 지우01: I dislike the infographics that constantly pop up for each player :/
[2:16:50] SOMAlul: he is meta cause he have range to hold the lane in most matchups of the top lane. he have a huge team fight impact with the mega
[2:16:52] morotodo: tarzan is god
[2:16:58] MitskiOfTheLeaf: yall: leona is skillful

[2:18:58] g0vernor69: @MitskiOfTheLeaf So you are bad then
[2:19:03] ImSumWhatMad: I see the benefits of Gnar, like in theory I think he does really well. I just don't see him played well often
[2:19:05] Doki__Doki: >he thinks Leona E is easy to land  KEKW
[2:19:07] MitskiOfTheLeaf: im not the only one that thinks gnar is trash
[2:19:11] ImSumWhatMad: That's what I mean
[2:19:17] hiuregod: Gnar is meta because he's been buffed nonstop
[2:19:18] SOMAlul: you are playing against training dummys, this is faking top tier teams.
[2:19:20] papayasmithy: maybe you play against players with the reaction time of your grandma, then yes its easy
[2:19:26] MitskiOfTheLeaf: because it is
[2:19:34] MitskiOfTheLeaf: you think landing leona q is hard
[2:19:36] Doki__Doki: imo Gnar is trash because he's very situational, but that's just my opinion
