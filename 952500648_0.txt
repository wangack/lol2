[0:39:48] splintso: yer
[0:40:14] skot_lol: scout is solid pick
[0:40:25] midobbexmachina: Fofo perhaps?
[0:40:38] splintso: fofo is a good shout
[0:40:52] midobbexmachina: Scout is also underperforming IMO as hard as Rookie but he's on a winning team
[0:41:12] Neffydvda: caster on right sounds like he has a mental disability
[0:41:24] skot_lol: fofo is a rock for RA mr consistent
[0:41:51] raulnick: oh my god, i just can speak in englhish here? srry

[0:42:46] exotica1337: lgd vs omg starting at 10????
[0:42:54] skot_lol: jkl is contender but dude mad inted a few games
[0:43:16] mikro45l: @exotica1337 yes at full hour
[0:43:30] raulnick: chinese? what about communism, is that the solution of all the problems of the world right?
[0:43:37] Fyrixia: This year though JKL has been holding back his inting quite a bit
[0:43:39] splintso: for 1 game it looked like it was going to be jkl then viper hard carried
[0:43:59] upper90s: The Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and he was buried, and he rose again the third day, and he is offering everlasting life to all who will believe in him.
[0:44:01] kris_7q: How far are we from gametime?
[0:44:11] Fyrixia: That 1,1k average gold lead at 15 minutes will make jackeylove first
[0:44:26] TastyAMG: Viper > JKL for sure

[0:44:52] beovulfo85: Why not showing rosters for each team in the screen??
[0:45:01] hardstuck_dad: I legit like Viper more than JKL. Similar mechanics but he never ints that dirty
[0:45:22] skot_lol: JKL kinda hard carries Tes so understand but viper is so good this season
[0:46:24] pearcey222: Hahah

[0:47:12] therealjiggyjus: IDK I've been trying to fig out for like 30 mins now. battle of two awful teams
[0:47:19] pearcey222: Very very very simple
[0:47:40] Fyrixia: I'd say LGD is the less awful team
[0:47:41] hardstuck_dad: LWX was looking pretty up there at the begining
[0:47:51] TastyAMG: Double Elim PogChamp
[0:47:51] skot_lol: i think lgd wins cuz kramer and uniboy are not totally bad
[0:48:04] pearcey222: LGD uniboy and cult coming hard and then ofc karsa and jackeylove trolling on v5
[0:48:08] Sniper_Boss_21: sniper49GOLLUM
[0:48:10] splintso: @takesusanoonomikoto until kaisa was less op
[0:48:18] 롤메이저하리: 4.5H , 25.5U&O gg~
[0:48:20] pearcey222: I could pick this in my sleep
[0:48:32] therealjiggyjus: lgd is less awful and have been much better. just wouldn't be suprised if they get stomped neither lol
[0:48:43] splintso: crisp looked great when bo was playing
[0:48:48] pearcey222: Karsa/jackeylove/knight  then grab uniboy, cult and a random
[0:49:06] skot_lol: crisp fell off a bit post Bo
[0:49:17] pearcey222: Zhaou for support
[0:49:28] ohioisforfkinlovers: @pearcey222 who wins?
[0:49:45] kekwait12322: for fanduel?
[0:49:53] ohioisforfkinlovers: @pearcey222 who gets first drag?
[0:50:02] Fyrixia: Zhou is improving but not quite there yet
[0:50:03] pearcey222: LGD will be 2-1 and  TES 2-1
[0:50:21] ohioisforfkinlovers: @pearcey222 bold prediction
[0:50:28] pearcey222: Omg will take drag they like TT in theory of rushing for crazy kills
[0:50:46] Fyrixia: @pearcey222 I think thats a fair prediction
[0:50:46] M012345678: Why were there no games yesterday? NotLikeThis
[0:50:48] pearcey222: Keep in min V5 can very much upset TES
[0:51:02] skot_lol: lgd 2-0 tes 2-0
[0:51:16] Fyrixia: @pearcey222 I think TES isn't the cleanest team they usually run it down one game
[0:51:20] skot_lol: i think tes will just lane kingdom bot
[0:51:27] splintso: orengy arent the top players in their roles but they dominate as a team... love to see them play G2
[0:51:42] pearcey222: TES will exactly what @skot_lol said
[0:52:19] DI3GO_O7: how long til match?
[0:52:22] Fyrixia: Tes botlane is becoming very scary
[0:52:30] skot_lol: only way i see v5 win is through mole playing zoe or weiwei on a hyper carry
[0:52:50] hardstuck_dad: RW defeated the world semi finalist, they are legit Kappa
[0:53:11] kekwait12322: v5 beat tes last split 2-1 so they will atleast take one game i think
[0:53:12] skot_lol: V5 was such a shitshow 2020
[0:53:27] splintso: pff adc neeko was pog
[0:53:58] Yakuzazx: @pearcey222 How LGD will 2-1 instead of 2-0 ? just asking
[0:53:58] skot_lol: Ziv has to be one of the worst tops in lpl
[0:54:14] skot_lol: Rookie of the split:Bo :(
[0:54:21] optisoft: shouldnt rookie be the rookie of the split?
[0:54:24] hellosputnik: Hysterics loves iG
[0:54:30] ShirleySzM: rip Bo
[0:54:33] kekwait12322: they wanted to say viper KEKW
[0:54:41] splintso: except wen ppl were hard flaming ziv the other night he popped off :P
[0:54:42] hardstuck_dad: Not hard to look better than theShy tbh Kappa
[0:54:44] ShirleySzM: I think zhuo is  good for a rookie as well
[0:54:45] 33crash: lgd 2-0 guys ??
[0:55:04] skot_lol: Its prob viper since hes considered rookie
[0:55:13] misothebear: When does the game start?
[0:55:28] pearcey222: OMG has the potential to take a strong lead in one game and this could effect LGD as they are famous for dropping late games
[0:55:56] kekwait12322: lgd will 2-0 probably they looked so good against Rare Atom and broke their 9 win streak
[0:56:03] skot_lol: LGD has kramer. hes like the grandad of late game scaling adcs
[0:56:09] pearcey222: But OMG needs a strong draft for this scenario
[0:56:15] 33crash: @misothebear in 14 min
[0:56:23] Emp_Nero: !howlongtillgame
[0:56:38] skot_lol: actually omg early game not that bad but they are so bad mid game and teamfighting
[0:56:40] AbelSpiders: 2-1 LGD

[2:28:28] volkmarus: @mightwei LPL teamfights to much early game which senna fasting absolutely loses hard in. LPL teams struggle with being okay with scaling, which is why Seraphine and Senna are not in the meta for LPL

[3:02:44] hugh_bert_phillip: @nixieed "teamfights" Notw my word. Exact same laning phase. If you are teamfighting in laning phase... you're playing ARAM.

[3:05:06] kepzzz: LGD win. easy.
[3:05:15] Piezo: LGD teamfight is nasty
[3:05:18] thresh4dayz: Seraphine was a mistake
[3:05:21] Markeizoo: pog aatrox
[3:05:21] yorickandmori: lgd win, sorry guys
[3:05:23] DegenReb: LGD win just because of the seraphine pick

[3:05:39] dand1ezal: OMG wins if the game goes past 35 min
[3:05:41] kepzzz: OMG not having a better comp. dont get fooled around by silver. seraphine win this

[3:05:52] Wide_Fry: Seraphine game winner
[3:05:53] nixxy_7: @freebujuirl but a good midlaner wont sit in lane... will take note if top is more tankyer and needs help or if adc is behind or ahead and needs help , bc top is the center of it all and has to have GOOD map awarness... which not many midlaners know that :)
[3:05:57] pardal_sz: seraphine and hecarim nice combo
[3:06:02] Bobby_Bayou: Lilia needs to carry
[3:06:07] hugh_bert_phillip: @nixieed Again... you don't have to. Most top level teams trade objective if they don't have control. In the LPL they'll fight and lose (or win because they're just better). But yeh. You don't have to teamfight in laning phase. and usually by second Herald, laning phase is way over.

[3:08:28] hugh_bert_phillip: @nixieed and if you pick Ryze, you trade objectives and don't teamfight in laming phase. Hence... my point. Its not Ryze's fault he was played incorrectly by some people trying to teamfight.

[4:15:36] HystericsCasts: For context: it's emote only chat because we are on a delay with V5 vs TES. Due to V5 being in their home arena the game started at 7PM CN time. The first series ran over that so we are running games in full as quickly as possible to catch up. Apologies for the delay but this is the best way to keep chat spoiler free and give you guys the full game :)

[4:54:28] HystericsCasts: For context: it's emote only chat because we are on a delay with V5 vs TES. Due to V5 being in their home arena the game started at 7PM CN time. The first series ran over that so we are running games in full as quickly as possible to catch up. Apologies for the delay but this is the best way to keep chat spoiler free and give you guys the full game :)
