[2:43:33] TheOreoCupcake: Do you think we just need to get used to them?
[2:43:35] RustyTheCaster: bit harsh to the new casters
[2:43:39] TheOreoCupcake: And they need to get used to the casting?
[2:43:41] scool67: lyric best
[2:43:45] RustyTheCaster: they're new and learning, they'll improve
[2:43:50] TheOreoCupcake: I think we'll get used to them
[2:44:01] TheOreoCupcake: because I am sure we were sceptical to all new casters

[2:47:12] Dalam33: best of 3 should be world wide imo
[2:47:12] M012345678: I think chat just needs to get used to the new casters, I think they are great
[2:47:20] TheOreoCupcake: LEC has a round robin

[2:48:10] Dalam33: Clement keep up the work man! Really enjoy the casts
[2:48:10] TheOreoCupcake: @Clement_LoL He's new, we'll get used to him and once he gets used to it, it'll be great
[2:48:33] M012345678: @Clement_LoL great job of casting the game from both of you!

[3:10:49] palmyboys: @legwan_z_galapagos Nah LPL teams earn too much and pay their players more than any other league (some 1 mill+) plus all the sponsorships and endorsements. There’s no point in matchfixing
[3:10:53] senriitsustalkie: Damwon always play over 2 maps vs stronger teams

[3:12:05] TheOreoCupcake: Welcome Guys!
[3:12:06] palmyboys: Just because you lose ur bets doesn’t mean it’s fixed lmao @singedotpforlife
[3:12:13] senriitsustalkie: LPL 2nd league has match fixing, i don't think the LPL main league has fixing
[3:12:19] therealjiggyjus: matchfixing def a thing i wish i knew every throw beforehand
[3:12:20] RobynBankz: @thresh4dayz did i lie though????
[3:12:40] nobrainsoce: @palmyboys research this stuff before you start spouting arguements your just making up as you please

[3:12:57] sheepstand: no match fixing their all dumb as shit
[3:13:03] RobynBankz: @mikro45l  nothing is wrong with feminine hips. but...i mean...statistically???
[3:13:07] palmyboys: @he4ts3eker exactly that. The youth leagues and lower divisions definitely have matchfixing. There’s way too much money in LPL to matchfix though
[3:13:16] therealjiggyjus: @dpevo16 yehh they looked really bad that day. still wouldn't say they're a bad team. they looked back on form today lol
[3:13:29] nobrainsoce: theres way too much money not to

[5:01:07] Leksou: Shanks LUL
[5:01:08] westonw7: naw we too much better
[5:01:15] Raja888: WE isnt as good as 11-3 record though. Dont expect much from them in playoffs
[5:01:21] TheOreoCupcake: HOW DID BIUBIU DIE??
[5:01:21] loba_is_bad_lul: BLG 322 TEAM LUL

[5:02:29] dpevo16: I’m the Don that Tipped this entire chat on this entire series flawlessly
[5:02:48] BLG_worlds_2024: WE doesnt lose when they pick Jinx and tanks. picking aphelios and fiora isnt it
[5:02:55] westonw7: @raja888 who do u think is best in lpl
[5:03:10] TheOreoCupcake: It's either RNG or TES
[5:03:12] hiuregod: Shanks just wants this game to be over KEKW
[5:03:25] Cryonik: shanks throwing to make the game more even
[5:03:25] Seventh_Sky: jinx viable?
[5:03:33] hiuregod: dude prolly just wanna dip and play some soloq at this point
[5:03:38] TheOreoCupcake: Jinx is a great pick now
[5:03:41] vicviper: still slower than 1557 LUL
[5:03:41] BLG_worlds_2024: @Seventh_Sky jinx is the best adc in the LPL right now
[5:03:44] rabid_ham: that doesnt change sportsmanship
[5:03:51] irlgigachad: the classic omg ff
[5:03:54] Raja888: @westonw7 in my opinion TES
[5:04:03] Seventh_Sky: @omgHmm not just a scaling pick eh
[5:04:09] Cryonik: 19 stacks Pog
[5:04:10] Jesoy: I think WE is good, they could get top 4 or even finals but LPL is so close atm. It’s hard to predict
[5:04:24] westonw7: tes is prob my top team also
[5:04:41] orionte17: WE is top 6, maybe top 4
[5:04:42] Raja888: FPX with bo was easily looking like the best team unfortunate what happend
[5:04:44] SnooKappa: WE got to demacia cup finals but got 3-0 by TES
[5:04:53] Piezo: WE problem is always mid laner isnt good enough to compete and their botlane not consistent enough and lane poorly
[5:04:54] BLG_worlds_2024: @Seventh_Sky they showed earlier that she is 9-3 since the buffs. her Q is insane now. especially for someone like jiumeng who is very good in team fights
[5:05:09] Ricooo15: LPL playoffs will probably be more entertaining than MSI or Worlds even
[5:05:26] Jesoy: Yeah tes might win this split again
