[0:28:43] kaoyanshuxue: WutFace WutFace WutFace
[0:29:07] Munchables: Any Estar fans in chat? Kappa
[0:29:36] TheFlyingMonkey05: 👆🏻
[0:29:55] kaoyanshuxue: LEC>LCS
[0:30:39] TheOreoCupcake: Hello guys
[0:30:57] TheFlyingMonkey05: Estar best team ion the world, hard not to be a fan Kappa
[0:31:09] TheOreoCupcake: How are you guys doing today?
[0:31:14] ursinia: LUL although am stuck as a Canadian having LCS my league to cheer on
[0:31:21] ursinia: it is hilarous to watch
[0:32:18] ursinia: :D I really enjoy watching the LPL though
[0:32:33] TheOreoCupcake: Some games between the top teams of the LPL are amazing
[0:32:45] TheOreoCupcake: I'd say it's much closer in the LPL than other leagues
[0:33:06] TheOreoCupcake: So a game between RNG and TES is a lot better than something like FNC and G2
[0:33:16] 21044275: easy bets today, bet EDG and JDG for free money
[0:33:33] ursinia: It is seriously nutty at times eh?
[0:33:52] TheOreoCupcake: lol yeah, wait until you see the game tomorrow
[0:34:16] ursinia: can i just say though, I don't like JDG's logo
[0:34:18] TheOreoCupcake: @wzhqing Then why are you here if you just wanna trash talk everyone here? Not a good use of your time, is it?
[0:34:24] ursinia: :(
[0:34:26] TheOreoCupcake: Me too
[0:34:31] TheOreoCupcake: There's some creepy guy
[0:34:43] TheOreoCupcake: LNG's logo is amazing, it's a Mythical Creature
[0:34:53] ursinia: YES
[0:35:17] TheOreoCupcake: Btw, don't miss the TES vs RNG game tomorrow
[0:35:38] TheOreoCupcake: Tell your friends, tell your cat
[0:35:39] ursinia: I don't follow the LPL schedule much, but good to know
[0:36:11] ursinia: shout out to WE and RNG too, the got simple nice logos.
[0:36:25] TheOreoCupcake: Yeah, just letters. Even TES logo is great
[0:36:28] 21044275: Where were you when RA is the best team in the world
[0:36:32] TheOreoCupcake: It looks like a Knight's helmet.
[0:36:41] TheOreoCupcake: COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!
[0:36:49] 21044275: Not kidding though, RA is going to MSI to body some kids like GenG and Rogue
[0:37:04] 21044275: Leyan will show the world what he is made of
[0:37:06] ursinia: MSI going to be hot
[0:37:10] TheOreoCupcake: Ruler, literal world champion vs iBoy
[0:37:17] TheOreoCupcake: iBoy is gonna make ruler cry
[0:37:29] 21044275: Leyan >>> Clid
[0:37:38] 21044275: Fofo is the best player in the world and will body GenG's rando mid
[0:37:39] TheOreoCupcake: Clid is CEKW
[0:37:44] 21044275: Cube will smurf
[0:37:50] TheOreoCupcake: Foker >>> Badd
[0:38:05] TheOreoCupcake: Foker >>> Shoemaker
[0:38:10] TheOreoCupcake: Foker is the best
[0:38:23] ursinia: So I never heard of ES, are they relatively new?
[0:39:05] TheOreoCupcake: They were known as Estar gaming before
[0:39:15] TheOreoCupcake: only in Spring 2020, they were known as eStar
[0:39:36] TheOreoCupcake: So i'd say it's like topsports gaming becoming Top Esports
[0:39:51] Yakuzazx: any chance for EDG 2-1 ?
[0:39:59] ursinia: oh
[0:40:05] 21044275: Don't think so
[0:40:05] Yakuzazx: like TT had on FPX
[0:40:10] TheFlyingMonkey05: No estar gonna 2-0 EZ
[0:40:10] 21044275: 2-0
[0:40:11] TheOreoCupcake: EDG can 2-0
[0:40:17] ursinia: @TheOreoCupcake  you from NA too?
[0:40:18] 21044275: FPX is much worse than EDG
[0:40:28] TheOreoCupcake: @ursinia Nope
[0:40:35] ursinia: oooP
[0:40:38] Yakuzazx: True
[0:40:41] TheOreoCupcake: FPX with Bo is Poggers, FPX with Beichuan is KEKW
[0:41:21] ursinia: LUL honestly my LPL knowledge is limited to Worlds
[0:41:26] 21044275: I'm about to order some food, please tell me what to get
[0:41:38] TheOreoCupcake: @21044275 What are your options?
[0:41:56] jurgen_wotan: is there any way to see it from the Chinese web?
[0:42:00] Yakuzazx: @21044275 Kebab
[0:42:05] TheOreoCupcake: @ursinia I do not blame you. 17 teams, too much to keep track of. The TT vs RW game yesterday, made me die a little.
[0:42:12] 21044275: Since I'm in China, literally everything Chinese, and generic fastfoods
[0:42:13] 광저우3등시민: what is bgm name
[0:42:20] ursinia: @TheOreoCupcake  die in good or bad way kekw
[0:42:27] TheOreoCupcake: Bad
[0:42:34] TheOreoCupcake: The game was terrible, it was bottom vs bottom
[0:42:35] ursinia: oh no
[0:42:54] Yakuzazx: @21044275 FeelsBadMan
[0:43:10] TheOreoCupcake: @jurgen_wotan You can watch it on Douyu
[0:43:13] ursinia: @21044275  honestly I decide on how i am feeling, like there are days i don't want to eat greasy food :D
[0:43:17] Yakuzazx: @TheOreoCupcake RW vs TT who got it at the end
[0:43:35] TheOreoCupcake: TT won 2-0
[0:43:35] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[0:43:46] Yakuzazx: @TheOreoCupcake Ty <£
[0:43:46] TheOreoCupcake: I did not want that game to go to 3 games
[0:43:48] bullymagu1re: ratJAM
[0:44:09] Yakuzazx: so its EDG 2-0 then lads ?
[0:44:17] TheOreoCupcake: I'd say so
[0:44:29] Yakuzazx: looks like it tbh
[0:44:40] zh3at: ratJAM
[0:44:41] TheOreoCupcake: ES is a very shaky team
[0:44:53] Yakuzazx: very indeed
[0:45:01] TheOreoCupcake: EDG had an excellent start although they have dropped a little
[0:45:08] TheOreoCupcake: The game against TES, the zoe pick lost them the game.
[0:45:12] ursinia: @TheOreoCupcake  if I were to hazard a guess, you're somewhere from oceania TheIlluminati
[0:45:40] TheOreoCupcake: @ursinia I shuttle between Europe and Asia :)
[0:45:50] ursinia: ooh
[0:45:57] Yakuzazx: thats cool
[0:46:09] TheOreoCupcake: Study in EU
[0:46:14] TheOreoCupcake: From Asia
[0:46:20] ursinia: ah
[0:46:40] TheOreoCupcake: JDG have already locked in their seeds for the playoffs
[0:46:53] Yakuzazx: so whats ur take on JDG vs LNG
[0:47:03] ursinia: I'm in the "boring" part of Canada where there are mountains, lakes, and plains LUL
[0:47:06] TheOreoCupcake: And JDG have a 69% win rate
[0:47:09] Yakuzazx: clean sweep for JDG or 2-1
[0:47:11] TheFlyingMonkey05: Could be a close series
[0:47:31] TheOreoCupcake: JDG beat RNG quite convincingly
[0:47:32] Yakuzazx: @ursinia thats lovely too
[0:47:56] TheOreoCupcake: I'd say JDG take the win but in a 2-1 game
[0:48:10] TheOreoCupcake: I wouldn't say it's gonna be a clean sweep because LNG have something to play for
[0:48:12] ursinia: @Yakuzazx  if you browse around the internet, you may have seen pictures of Lake Louise :)
[0:48:37] Edgerobot: catJAM
[0:48:46] TheOreoCupcake: What is that huge building in the lake?
[0:48:56] TheOreoCupcake: Is it a resort or a castle?
[0:49:03] Yakuzazx: @TheOreoCupcake LNG stuggled a little when playing against LGD but thats weeks back
[0:49:10] ursinia: a hotel
[0:49:30] Edgerobot: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[0:49:34] TheOreoCupcake: I think JDG win through bot diff
[0:49:54] Yakuzazx: right
[0:49:58] TheOreoCupcake: Or Zoom just takes over against M1kuya
[0:50:03] ursinia: first time hearing LNG
[0:50:13] TheOreoCupcake: Because Zoom played excellent against RNG
[0:50:21] TheOreoCupcake: @ursinia They were previously known as Snake Esports
[0:50:23] Yakuzazx: @TheOreoCupcake ye could recall
[0:50:35] ursinia: ohhh ok, hear of that
[0:50:56] Yakuzazx: And for which country ur in if i may ask @TheOreoCupcake
[0:51:10] TheFlyingMonkey05: If they play like they did against RNG itll be a quick 2-0. If they play like before itll be a lot coser
[0:51:10] TheOreoCupcake: Singapore
[0:51:17] ursinia: ooo Singapore
[0:51:27] Yakuzazx: and in Europe ?

[1:04:09] Lerin_1707: BEst adc in the world ATM
[1:04:11] TheOreoCupcake: Trueee
[1:04:26] TheOreoCupcake: EDG deserves the title also, been a while since they won it.
[1:04:27] ursinia: @TheOreoCupcake  i just know they are a decent team :D , but i haven't watched them or know hard stats
[1:04:41] Lerin_1707: yeah
[1:04:43] TheOreoCupcake: Zoe went wrong

[1:09:33] ursinia: KEKW
[1:09:42] TheFlyingMonkey05: They'll make it this year! I'm a believer of the church of Xiaohu
[1:10:09] TheOreoCupcake: Honestly, Ming has been smurfing for RNG
[1:10:10] 21044275: Honestly I'm really not sure why EDG picked up Flandre and not a younger top laner
[1:10:14] TheOreoCupcake: He has been so so good
[1:10:21] TheOreoCupcake: Flandre is the reason EDG lose
[1:10:29] yun_0409: FLANDRE carried LNG for so many years
[1:10:41] 21044275: Flandre is too old imo
[1:10:42] ursinia: OH WAIT I did was ES
[1:10:42] DterrorA: Cause Flandre has proven he is good?
[1:10:58] ursinia: oh man, forgot when ES last played but.. oof :(
[1:11:04] 21044275: younger top laner > flandre
[1:11:05] ursinia: that game was not pretty
[1:11:11] mostdopegypsy: EDG are way worse after chinese new year
[1:11:20] TheFlyingMonkey05: Flandre is 23 wdym??
[1:11:23] mostdopegypsy: Flandre looked so good before
[1:11:44] TheOreoCupcake: You have to admit he has not been performing as good as he should

[1:40:15] mindyourbusin3s: viper mechanics are better but ruler mechanics is the best

[1:40:43] lasharcus: anyone who says viper is better mechanically than jkl doesnt have eyes
[1:40:49] yun_0409: JKL = early game
[1:40:49] lasharcus: jkl's laning is much better
[1:40:58] bard_il_bardo_: guys jkl is the only one who goes in 1 v5 and solocarry the fights
[1:41:03] TheOreoCupcake: JKL is for laning
[1:41:04] chunklin1: jkl smurfs late game what are you saying
[1:41:05] bard_il_bardo_: he is superaggressive
[1:41:09] ThingyyyTV: @theoreocupcake survive to late game and it's 4v5, neither option is viable
[1:41:10] chunklin1: hes a team fight specialist
[1:41:10] bard_il_bardo_: both in lane and in tf
[1:41:14] TheOreoCupcake: Viper for late game, JKL positioning late game is weird
[1:41:20] Lerin_1707: viper > jkl lategame
[1:41:20] cherrim0709: South Korea is not a country, but a territory of Russia. Koreans live in South Korea illegally.
[1:41:28] lasharcus: viper was useless vs ig and tes
[1:41:36] TheOreoCupcake: @Thingyyyyy It's quite simple, malphite isn't a good pick into Jayce. Already discussed by the casters.
[1:41:41] jacquoz: ES LUL
[1:41:42] hi_im_snom: @cherrim0709 cool no one cares
[1:41:44] Lerin_1707: useless? wtf he got a penta
[1:41:48] TheOreoCupcake: Even if Zs got the solo kill, he's 70 cs down
[1:42:01] beet000: gg
[1:42:03] chunklin1: LOL penta means nothing he didnt get it till the game was over
[1:42:07] lasharcus: @lerin_1707 you mean after doing nothing the whole game bravo?
[1:42:08] Heisenptar: is rat the death leader in lpl ?
[1:42:10] ThingyyyTV: @theoreocupcake and sorcery malphite at that
[1:42:13] lasharcus: he needed 4 items and elder
[1:42:14] chunklin1: watch the rest of the game genius
[1:42:19] lasharcus: to do something
[1:42:21] RedOsprey: gg go next?
[1:42:28] TheOreoCupcake: @Thingyyyyy Nope, any malphite is bad against Jayce.
[1:42:28] scottoflorida2014: After watching EDG RNG WE TES and FUN, I don't see anyone in LPL that can beat TSM at Worlds this year
[1:42:37] lasharcus: the game was already over
[1:42:41] hi_im_snom: @scottoflorida2014 KEKW

[1:44:15] tha_black_beetle: @TheOreoCupcake everytime jayce trades you he goes melee with q LUL
[1:44:18] yun_0409: Ppl need to stop hyping TSM they just went 0-6 last year and choke when it matters like Tottenham
[1:44:23] scottoflorida2014: Why aren't they picking Teemo after so many buffs? Teemo can 1 v9 in the jungle now
[1:44:31] ThingyyyTV: @theoreocupcake "pros run it so it's the only option"
[1:44:43] TheOreoCupcake: It's the best option
[1:44:54] AL3KS_Despacito: TSM 0-6 KEKW
[1:44:59] scottoflorida2014: @gl1tch_0409 Oh stop, they lost so others could win. They didn't want to win. That's sportsmanship
[1:45:01] TheOreoCupcake: @tha_black_beetle How many times did Jayce even go into the Malphite?
[1:45:08] eysayh1: Its the best option, every high elo jayce main tell me this build is annoying to versus
[1:45:14] M012345678: @gl1tch_0409 NA just doesn't know what else to do, give them a glimmer of "hope"

[1:45:54] tha_black_beetle: @TheOreoCupcake by taking grasp inspiration secondary u give yourself the most sustain early and grasp tree scales well
[1:45:56] cherrim0709: Korean is a hybrid bred by Chinese, Japanese and Russian.
[1:46:01] M012345678: Almost perfect
[1:46:03] ksh0863: Viper PogChamp
[1:46:14] Jo3Th33gg: can someone tell me why munchables is a color caster now? Did he swap?
[1:46:18] scottoflorida2014: If Team Liquid goes to MSI for NA, I will be an EU fan.  No more TL please
[1:46:21] ksh0863: Viper vs Ruler would be fire PogChamp
[1:46:24] TheOreoCupcake: @tha_black_beetle You don't prock grasp against Jayce, gosh. Jayce wouldn't even want to go into the malphite.
[1:46:42] Raja888: TL G2 TES DK
[1:46:49] TheOreoCupcake: All flandre did was Press Range Q against Malph
[1:46:52] tha_black_beetle: @TheOreoCupcake so u let jayce get 10 cs per min and u lose LMFAO
[1:46:56] Eindeh: @TheOreoCupcake Even the damage graph just now says that, BTW
[1:46:57] 21044275: Gala is the best adc in the world
[1:47:10] ksh0863: Gala kekw
[1:47:17] eysayh1: cuz jayce melee e range is bigger then malphite auto range u doodoo
[1:47:24] scottoflorida2014: Breaking News, I just read that TES is wanting to replace Jackeylove with Sneaky.  That would be huge and guarantee worlds finals then
[1:47:36] eysayh1: plus its clearly jg gapped toplane, how is it malphite's problem
[1:47:37] Eindeh: @scottoflorida2014 LUL

[1:47:53] TheOreoCupcake: @tha_black_beetle That's basically what happened. He was already 70 cs down even when the same score. Don't pick malphite into Jaycel.
[1:48:19] ksh0863: TES vs RNG who wins?

[2:36:00] Bob_the_Valiant: forreal tho a lot of the good tops started off really garbage, splyce wunderwear was a meme player and Smeb won the longpanda award for worst top his rookie year
[2:36:13] DEPUTYCAPTAIN: G2 will need to Sell rekkles and Caps for a straight out trade for Niles
[2:36:23] guimauves: NUGURI WOULD GO TO NA BUT HE WAS TOO SCARED OF NILES KEKW
[2:36:30] zedocaxo: tsm? hsushdhsuuss

[2:39:47] DEPUTYCAPTAIN: Word from the community are whispering that Niles is smashin Poki
[2:40:22] preketdung10: We all know Niles is the next smeb😂
[2:41:00] DEPUTYCAPTAIN: They need to give Niles carrys instead of playing Gragas
[2:41:13] Jayblesz: BOOBA
[2:41:15] preketdung10: he's already the best player on the planet
[2:41:17] jdgfanpog: wait edg won that fast? i played only one soloQ game and they already won KEKW
[2:41:49] haskula12: EU would be far better than Korea and China if they change to a bo3 system like LCK and LPL
[2:41:52] aries_jw: Why is Niles getting hard memed?`kek
[2:42:06] hankthetank_8: mmmm  grill
[2:42:10] preketdung10: niles vs rascal cammille must watch
[2:42:32] DEPUTYCAPTAIN: On Stage Niles is a different Beast, since they playing remotely, they GG is getting like 200ms ping
[2:42:51] aries_jw: Niles built different?
[2:43:02] TheOreoCupcake: Niles has different DNA kekw

[2:43:28] TheOreoCupcake: MEME TEAMS KEKW
[2:43:29] haskula12: Tommorow is playoffs for Na? POGGERS
[2:43:40] preketdung10: TSM for sure we all know they have korean and chinnese boost
[2:43:57] preketdung10: and then go 0-6 at worlds
[2:44:24] DEPUTYCAPTAIN: i think with ryOma in the starting line up, 100t will 3-1 C9
[2:44:32] aries_jw: Jensen hasnt been good since 2019
[2:44:47] preketdung10: I think Tsm will defend their tittle with swordart and POE popping off
[2:44:55] ga2006187329: peepoClap
[2:45:16] preketdung10: we all know how POE carried Misfit last 2017

[2:52:26] ursinia: ;)
[2:53:17] ye1l: TES gonna win spring playoffs. Saving my predictions I made before the split started
[2:53:42] TheOreoCupcake: RNG has an easy way to lose, just camp Xiaohu
[2:53:42] ye1l: and good guy BO getting banned so my predictions for the top 4 seems even more plausible
[2:53:51] my_cat_typed: morning WeirdChamp
[2:54:02] ursinia: @TheOreoCupcake I'll see you tomorrow then, eh? Calling it quits, too tired LUL i'm voting on JDG win
[2:54:06] flandreweishen: RNGWIN versus tes
[2:54:13] ye1l: 369 has been rolling 9s all season, he's sooo good right now
[2:54:14] TheOreoCupcake: Karsa will certainly camp Xiaohu, RNG will lose kekw
[2:54:21] miguelin9912: MSI POGGERS
[2:54:22] CertainlySomeoneHere: @ursinia goodnight
[2:54:41] ursinia: @CertainlySomeoneHere PopCorn :-) LuvSign
[2:54:47] TheOreoCupcake: @ursinia Byee, see ya tomorrow. I certainly wouldn't stay up for watching these games but the RNG TES game is good. Night Night.

[2:58:20] TheOreoCupcake: LPL MUSIC IS THE BEST. WHO CHOSE THE PLAYLIST?
[2:58:38] ye1l: whilst 369 is by far the biggest reason behind TES sprinting to the top of the standings
[2:59:12] axelan1: ratJAM
[2:59:25] TheOreoCupcake: KEKW BLAME TARZAN
[3:00:37] TheOreoCupcake: Zoom smurfed this game
[3:00:50] jocelynyme: JDG vs TES Finals again
[3:01:32] Moobot: Calm the spam, @DarkXEndless (warning)
[3:02:58] 21044275: Real talk, I actually have no idea who will win LPL this split, the region is that stacked
[3:03:10] 亦大: BrainSlug BrainSlug BrainSlug
[3:03:16] 21044275: I feel like RA, TES, RNG, WE and JDG can all win
[3:03:19] 亦大: BrainSlug BrainSlug BrainSlug BrainSlug LUL LUL WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:03:32] Misha_Agervig: I don't see RA winning
[3:03:50] 21044275: Why not? RA has top 3 players in 4 roles
[3:03:53] Stvph123: I think rng/tes will win 2021 spring lpl
[3:04:01] 21044275: Cube, Leyan, Fofo and Hang are all top 3 in their positions
[3:04:12] StarSashimi: best of 5 is a whole new fight for Ra
[3:04:12] Misha_Agervig: I see TES JDG RNG EDG and WE
[3:04:12] 어우이슬: tes or rng 4 sure
[3:04:38] Stvph123: ra not stable
[3:04:46] 21044275: I don't think EDG will ever win another LPL split
[3:04:47] ye1l: cube is not top 3
[3:04:47] detaaaa: GRF TARZAN vs KANAVI KEKW
[3:05:01] 21044275: EDG is the team I'm least convinced of in the top
[3:05:06] ye1l: it's laughable to call cube top 3
[3:05:08] 21044275: top 7*
[3:05:11] StarSashimi: cube is definitely not top 3
[3:05:19] chilledgh0st: @21044275 can you explain why?
[3:05:31] 21044275: Just a gut feeling
[3:05:33] Misha_Agervig: yeah I don't see RA really competing and I really don't see how you see them have so many top 3 players
[3:05:51] Misha_Agervig: fofo I agree on
[3:05:54] 21044275: Well Breathe and Nuguri are 100% above Cube, but who else?
[3:05:56] ye1l: RA has a really good jungler and a good midlaner
[3:06:04] Misha_Agervig: zoom?
[3:06:13] Stvph123: fofo I agree in top 3
[3:06:15] ye1l: 369 zoom Flandre
[3:06:17] 21044275: How can I forget Zoom damn
[3:06:23] 21044275: Ok you got me with Cube not being top 3
[3:06:27] Misha_Agervig: RA I agree with mid and jgl
[3:06:37] chilledgh0st: yea there is no way cube is top 3 top laners in lpl is probably most stacked
[3:06:40] 21044275: Hang is one of the best support this split tho
[3:06:58] ye1l: without leyan RA would get knocked out very fast in playoffs
[3:07:03] chilledgh0st: yea hang is looking decent in recent games I watched
[3:07:03] Misha_Agervig: yeah hang is good, but top is hard to say
[3:07:09] ye1l: he's the biggest reason that they're winning games
[3:07:29] chilledgh0st: yea but sometimes leyan ints so hard tho
[3:07:35] chilledgh0st: it's like he is inconsistent
[3:07:39] bolyvfr: Only good player in RA is Fofo
[3:07:47] 21044275: Imo Leyan is the most mechanically gifted jungler in the LPL after Bo
[3:07:52] Misha_Agervig: supp ming crisp lvmao
[3:07:54] ye1l: but in return he's the main reason that RA is winning games
[3:08:12] ye1l: crisp and ming are way better than LvMao imo
[3:08:15] 21044275: With Bo gone, there are no jungler that can match Leyan in pure mechanics
[3:08:23] Roflbroek69: Winnie the pooh
[3:08:31] chilledgh0st: would leyan perform better than xun if he was still in IG?
[3:08:34] karolynn_x: GayPride
[3:08:44] 21044275: No, cause Leyan doesn't fit IG's shit system
[3:08:51] 21044275: Leyan was wasting his career away so hard on IG
[3:08:51] Misha_Agervig: oh yeah leyan was on IG
[3:08:53] ye1l: LvMao got overhyped cuz bard was meta and he's turbo insane on the champ
[3:09:07] ye1l: IG needs a jungler like Meteor
[3:09:15] ye1l: who ganks like an animal
[3:09:19] nanoide1: LNG win people confirmed 98%
[3:09:21] 亦大: LUL
[3:09:28] Stvph123: I think ig has no system
[3:09:38] Misha_Agervig: lvmao is still a top 3 LPL support to me along with ming and crisp
[3:09:49] ye1l: Meteor is like Ning but with a brain, imo the best fit for IG
[3:09:52] 亦大: @roflbroek69 poor wall LUL LUL
[3:09:53] too2bi: @ye1l Yea LvMao Bard is insane
[3:09:56] vegeta1071: GRF JG VS GRF JG LUL
[3:10:01] chilledgh0st: junglers this split in lpl the two that I think are really good is beishang and meteor
[3:10:05] kidnapping_santa_claus: LNG red side naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:10:14] ye1l: yeah but crisp and ming is in another tier
[3:10:24] 21044275: Whichever team from LPL goes to MSI, I'm confident they can smash DWG
[3:10:29] ye1l: like they're a full tier above the 3rd best support
[3:10:33] 21044275: DWG is massively downgraded in top lane
[3:10:35] ye1l: I'm not
[3:10:39] Misha_Agervig: yeah I put it ming 1 crisp 2 and lvmao 3
[3:10:52] chilledgh0st: bruh dwg is still looking so strong tho
[3:11:04] ye1l: DWG still has a better performing jungler than the teams that could beat them
[3:11:04] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[3:11:07] rehs0m: alphari gonna shit on nuguri XD
[3:11:09] chilledgh0st: even G2 with rekkles
[3:11:24] Misha_Agervig: DWG Kia is still looking good, but Nuguri is being missed
[3:11:40] 21044275: G2 is a non factor, any top LPL teams have way better jungler than G2
[3:11:47] 21044275: G2 will get jungle gapped so hard
[3:11:51] xryuuki1: khan LUL
[3:12:08] ye1l: Rekkles still a god though
[3:12:11] 21044275: Imagine Jankos getting matched vs Leyan or Beishang *shudders*
[3:12:26] Moobot: Calm the spam, @edgelordweeb (warning)
[3:12:29] Misha_Agervig: G2 is interesting I feel like they could take on anyone but lose to any top team too
[3:13:01] chilledgh0st: okay but jungle might not matter tho cuz their laners are insane too just sayin
[3:13:02] ye1l: if Rekkles played in LPL/LCK and got to scrim against top teams for years he would imo be the best adc in the world atm
[3:13:25] Misha_Agervig: maybe
[3:13:30] chilledgh0st: btw LS stream a few days ago mentioned that a western player is trying to get into LPL
[3:13:33] DatJonx: YES
[3:13:34] Misha_Agervig: Rekkles is certainly good
[3:13:39] TheOreoCupcake: Aphelios KEKW
[3:13:47] furyfish2000: are the teams representing different provinces?
[3:13:52] TheOreoCupcake: Sivir is open
[3:14:02] edgelordweeb: ming, crisp, meiko, hang, missing, iwandy, on, zhuo, and ppgod are all better than lvmao
[3:14:10] DatJonx: 200 years KEKW
[3:15:09] 21044275: Would Yagao be a top mid laner if he went to NA?
[3:15:15] TheOreoCupcake: Yes
[3:15:18] 씨맥입: Lck good
[3:15:39] TheOreoCupcake: POGGIES
[3:15:42] ye1l: yagao worse than Perkz tho
[3:15:43] nanoide1: sivir op omg
[3:15:47] edgelordweeb: @21044275 kind of, poe, jensen, perkz are better though
[3:15:49] kidnapping_santa_claus: ???
[3:15:50] aienkaka: S korea good
[3:16:03] 21044275: Jensen better than Yagao?
[3:16:13] edgelordweeb: yeah, for sure
[3:16:20] chilledgh0st: @edgelordweeb nah POE can't perform in important games
[3:16:24] TheOreoCupcake: I'd say Yagao is better than Jensen
[3:16:25] ah_bravo: KEKW
[3:16:29] ksh0863: JDG LETS GOOO
[3:16:34] Roflbroek69: Tarzaned is in china now??
[3:16:34] Misha_Agervig: poe is not better than yagao
[3:16:36] ye1l: Poe was really good at Worlds tho
[3:16:47] edgelordweeb: yagao is not that great, he's like the 12th best mid in the league
[3:16:57] ye1l: but Yagao could never do what Perkz did to RNG in 2018
[3:17:04] ye1l: no shot
[3:17:09] Misha_Agervig: True
[3:17:16] TheOreoCupcake: I would say Perks > Yagao > Jensen = POE
[3:17:38] chilledgh0st: @theoreocupcake same
[3:17:43] luk_kk: can LNG take this series ? or no way
[3:17:45] 21044275: How is Perkz performing this split?
[3:17:56] edgelordweeb: yagao over poe is just the result of hard buying into "DAE north america bad??? XD"
[3:18:00] TheOreoCupcake: Perkz is doing okay, worse than what I expected though
[3:18:06] bolyvfr: They must, or they eliminated
[3:18:13] DatJonx: Bornn ResidentSleeper Borianna ResidentSleeper Boristar ResidentSleeper
[3:18:13] 21044275: Well he spent his peak years as an adc
[3:18:19] TheOreoCupcake: I don't even consider POE "NA". He's more EU imo.
[3:18:21] ye1l: like you'd expect from spring split with no crowd after swapping roles
[3:18:31] 한번만해보자: @21044275 yeah
[3:18:34] TheOreoCupcake: He is most famous for his 5 game series against SKT
[3:18:43] chilledgh0st: @21044275 looks kinda shaky in the mid lane but next split he should adapt fine
[3:18:48] edgelordweeb: he's playing in NA, if he was playing in EU no one would say yagao is better
[3:19:05] TheOreoCupcake: I still would lol
[3:19:07] ye1l: perkz is a crunch time player, wouldn't care about his performance outside of spring and summer playoffs
[3:19:21] TheOreoCupcake: Perkz is playing in NA and in no world I would consider Yagao to be better
[3:19:29] synthpopthot: would yagao be a top laner if he played in NA Kappa
[3:19:43] synthpopthot: no he's be a mid laner Kappa
[3:19:45] ye1l: he inted LEC games too both as a mid and ad in reg season
[3:19:56] ye1l: and popped off in playoffs
[3:20:00] kidnapping_santa_claus: I hope that the it work JDG my bet is on you NotLikeThis
[3:20:11] TheOreoCupcake: He was the best Xayah and Kai'sa in worlds 2019
[3:20:15] Raja888: noc top wtf
[3:20:23] edgelordweeb: @theoreocupcake lwx
[3:20:25] 21044275: Zoom has been spanning Noc in KR soloq
[3:20:49] edgelordweeb: 2019 perkz over lwx is a delusional take
[3:20:56] Raja888: hope this works noc top seems like trolling they arent taking lng serious
[3:20:59] kylldeth: Ngl everytime Magical casts I cringe inside, he needs to work on his flow, he gets stuck on alot of words sometimes
[3:21:01] minervamaelstrom: Where is AlieAlie

[3:21:25] 21044275: Lvmao is you play like that I have no choice but to think you're a top support
[3:21:25] ksh0863: gg go next kekw
[3:21:41] therealjiggyjus: perkz is nowhere near lwx can we stop doing this everyday LUL
[3:21:44] yun_0409: Ming >>> Lvmao
[3:21:44] edgelordweeb: @personasoulx OMG's bench
[3:21:50] ixdrake: NO REPLAY ?

[3:45:03] ye1l: idk Chovy is hard griefing himself by staying in LCK, he could've probably had joined any LPL team aside from TES/EDG/IG

[3:45:09] anastaq12: jdg lost low tier league
[3:45:21] anastaq12: lmao
[3:45:23] vicviper: JDG wins from smart BP but falls apart after meta change or against straight-up better teams in other regions so it better not win spring if LPL wants to have a chance
[3:45:26] dpevo16: Drx map 2 +150
[3:45:29] Raja888: it was their first worlds people need to calm down one bad worlds doesnt mean bad team
[3:45:30] t_ofu: g2 gonna lose anyway
[3:45:30] QuarkStorm: @raja888 And TES wasn't even playing their best
[3:45:38] anastaq12: yeah prob rig best team in the china right?

[3:45:43] TheOreoCupcake: Knight was bad at worlds
[3:45:47] jacquoz: JDG so bad they beat top team LUL
[3:45:52] anastaq12: cuz they is the top of regular season
[3:45:59] TheOreoCupcake: If Knight was at his best performance, it would have been TES vs DWG finals
[3:46:01] dpevo16: Really good to wake up to my boy hysterics again
[3:46:03] sobersoap18: it was the first year of worlds for TES and some people just forget that it seems.
[3:46:13] hsuchihmo: Knight was bad and 2:0 drx so what about chovy LUL
[3:46:22] kenguin35: i think maybe its logical to leave judging how good the players are to the teams themselves
[3:46:25] noobs_eu_and_na_in_chats: silvers talking in chats and think they are world champions
[3:46:28] SC2_FeaR: An absolute beat down
[3:46:30] TheOreoCupcake: The Summer split Knight was so good

[3:47:05] sammy090123: ORNN WTF
[3:47:07] QuarkStorm: I feel like 369 is doing what Knight did for TES last year
[3:47:08] Raja888: TES had been fked by the meta change that went opposite to their strengths but still reached semis also support YYJ was just not good enough
[3:47:11] jacquoz: LNG Ornn most damage LUL
[3:47:18] kenguin35: ornn most damage because of zoom trading in lane
[3:47:23] sobersoap18: Bruh the Chinese twitter (weibo) is more toxic than twitch chat, I am already glad knight didn't shit his pants being his first year at worlds
[3:47:25] TheOreoCupcake: Zhuo is better than Yuyanjia
[3:47:31] mangomochee67: support YYJ was one of the worst support at worlds
[3:47:32] QuarkStorm: ^
[3:47:36] withindemon: There's no ifs, Knight choked at worlds and nothing will change it. TES choked worlds and thats it. They were just bad thats it
[3:47:49] TheOreoCupcake: This TES can do good at worlds, if Knight doesn't choke.
[3:47:49] minervamaelstrom: what
[3:47:57] Raja888: semis is decent run and they have upgraded support this year
[3:47:59] kenguin35: @sobersoap18 he got hyped up way too much and when he didnt play like peak form faker people were quick to flame
[3:48:04] therealjiggyjus: ok we get it ya say it everyday WutFace WutFace
[3:48:06] GeNoFPaniC: @raideroz agreed
[3:48:13] vicviper: @sobersoap18 because JKL gets most of the hate due to IG fanboys thinking he is the traitor
[3:48:30] noobs_eu_and_na_in_chats: NA fans + EU fans think they are better cant even make it to silver
[3:48:31] TheOreoCupcake: They reverse sweeped FNC and went to Semis. First time for that to happen in worlds.
[3:48:38] GeNoFPaniC: The JKL hate isnt justified imo
[3:48:38] sobersoap18: @sobersoap18 yeah, with Faker about to retire, they really want to set up a new GOAT
[3:48:39] kenguin35: @sobersoap18 you can't deny there are many flaws in JKL playstyle that good teams take adv of
[3:48:39] noobs_eu_and_na_in_chats: LUL LUL LUL LUL BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack BrokeBack
[3:48:41] hvngpham: knight pog
[3:48:43] QuarkStorm: @raideroz They went, lost and gained experience. It's all that matters
[3:48:44] TheOreoCupcake: I wouldn't say they played bad, I'm saying they could have been better
[3:48:45] jacquoz: IG fanboys are salty their team isn't the best anymore LUL
[3:48:47] Raja888: I dont get the mindset that JDG and TES disappointed so they should not go again like wtf.  Teams and players can improve
[3:48:58] TheOreoCupcake: @RBQuark And they went to semis, that's not a bad run.
[3:49:05] therealjiggyjus: ppl just love to be TES and JDG haters tbh

[4:20:28] 21044275: There was some time between when the hook landed
[4:20:35] ye1l: cait bard lane LUL draft that against a good team and you're probably banned for matchfixing
[4:20:38] 21044275: He literally ran in a straight line
[4:20:43] lunarwolffff: Wait how is loken losing this lane
[4:20:49] sobersoap18: @21044275 he had cleanse, wanted outplay
[4:21:02] ye1l: loken is 1v2 as cait
[4:21:07] 21044275: He could of outplayed without wasting his cleanse

[4:23:06] BLG_worlds_2024: Ziv is worse and it isnt even close
[4:23:07] sobersoap18: @N3WTYPE01 Dodging wastes time and that increase the possibility of being hit by another AA thus dying. His plan was foolproof except he didn't calculate the fact that Jinx commited another spell on top of the hook which killed him.
[4:23:09] wntwang: kinda cute cho
[4:23:12] tentva: Ziv <- WutFace WutFace

[4:55:54] anastaq12: @jothepuro so sad egg choked too against fnc
[4:56:02] hsuchihmo: PDD Gogoing was the best top
[4:56:09] anastaq12: why lpl teams choked in worlds
[4:56:23] sir_aldrien: At last fight light moves like a boss and team dies like a fly
[4:56:26] ye1l: @jothepuro idk if I should block you because of this stupidity or keep you unblocked for an occasional laugh. Kakao was never good.
[4:56:59] hsuchihmo: no not 2015 it was always OGN at that time
[4:57:03] anastaq12: unlucky
[4:57:04] jayce9262: @anastaq12 only edg and lgd choked other team just not good enough
[4:57:12] noobs_eu_and_na_in_chats: only children talks big and blocks people

[4:57:35] tahtaat: @anastaq12 idk dude, best 2 lpl team lose 3rd standing lpl team KEKW
[4:58:04] jayce9262: @jothepuro they were just bad
[4:58:17] anastaq12: @tahtaat sn was insane last year in worlds probably the best team in the team fights
[4:58:21] rteenur: Marin? Gimgoon?
[4:58:24] LitoSheppard: im very confused by this chat that seems to be trying to say the lpl overall has under performed at worlds?
[4:58:37] hiuregod: @jothepuro it was intz from cblol
[4:58:40] jayce9262: @jothepuro 2019 rng xiaohu choked and langx just bad
[4:58:41] anastaq12: @jothepuro lgd makes thin thing happen last worlds
[4:58:48] xmanlone: @anastaq12 they dont have SA anymore
[4:59:16] LitoSheppard: like its been consistently the second best region, has made semis every year, finals the last 3.. what are we doing here?
[4:59:20] anastaq12: @alemadrid17 yes if sword art stays they can be top of 3
[4:59:23] tahtaat: @anastaq12 ye ye but tes was a beast in team fights in lpl and jdg was the smartest team in world
[4:59:31] jayce9262: @jothepuro and they were in a group with skt and fnc, so not surprised they didnt make it out
[4:59:45] anastaq12: @tahtaat in seasons yes but in worlds sn was insane
[4:59:59] jayce9262: those 2 games agasint skt was really close btw
[5:00:04] anastaq12: @tahtaat even dog could win without teamfighting
[5:00:16] ye1l: JDG did not have better early game macro than 2020 DWG
[5:00:51] anastaq12: jdg's problem is yagao and loken
[5:01:08] anastaq12: @jothepuro with puff and Lucas so hard
[5:01:09] hiuregod: RNG x TES is a banger
[5:01:21] ye1l: Lucas is good
[5:01:22] jayce9262: jgd too relying on zoom and kanavi to carry
[5:01:36] anastaq12: @jayce9262 yes they don't have carry lanes
[5:01:45] anastaq12: @jayce9262 carry players are like baolan
[5:01:49] jayce9262: yagao is ok tbh
[5:01:59] tahtaat: yagao is key, did u guys watch their other mid lane player
[5:02:02] anastaq12: yagao is ok against average mid laners
[5:02:03] ye1l: if IG plays Wink and TheShy+Rookie plays at their best IG is still very good
[5:02:29] peterpans01: RNG vs TES pog
[5:02:31] anastaq12: @ye1l yes ı think puff seems good cuz the shy int slow
[5:02:38] Aegl: LPL looks so much weaker than last year sad...
[5:02:42] therealjiggyjus: yagao has been with jdg since they started he's like a key to them hes fine
[5:02:43] xtarblack: ratJAM
[5:02:53] hiuregod: @aegl LCK looks worse
[5:02:54] D4rkZ3r0: faker > lpl mids
[5:02:56] LitoSheppard: @ye1l you soundin like you watch worlds but not lpl
[5:03:01] anastaq12: @tahtaat xiye is much better thank yagao in everything but when he played in demacia Kanavi and zoom int so hard and lama is afk
[5:03:14] jayce9262: @Aegl its only spring and tes is still looking good
[5:03:32] anastaq12: @jothepuro yes even corn outperform him in worlds final
[5:04:08] jayce9262: @tahtaat xiye performing better in world form but in regular season yagao is better
[5:04:08] anastaq12: pawn probably the goat
