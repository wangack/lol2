[0:47:53] butters1584: LPL is busy dealing with their Chinese viewers KEKW I don't think they care about oversea viewers
[0:48:07] epiphanic101: @BlueNux They started the imports frenzy from the start so they crippled their own development
[0:48:13] HystericsCasts: Yeah the auto mod is sometimes silly

[0:48:41] BlueNux: @epiphanic101 That's true, but EU at one point also had imports. They just continued to develop their minor league system and also replace veterans at a faster rate
[0:48:51] ShyMewUwU: CHAT IM HIGH AF HELP
[0:49:08] TheOreoCupcake: I remember when G2 had Trick as their jungler
[0:49:11] l3vi1: @HystericsCasts You casting sumo wrestling would be Pog
