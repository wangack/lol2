But instead they just spam their NA is better than EU and the other way arround bullcrap, laughing about players sucking or other stuff. They dont even comprehend how much pressure it is to play in front of an audience and doing this professionally for money

[0:40:30] 0h_Attaboy: @farukabi93 yeah thats true. But imagine you could communicate with these players and they would communicate back in a mature way. Atleast you wouldnt have toxic ragefights in chat. I just mute these right away.Write them what i feel they should do and if they dont listen so be it.

[4:56:04] 19Champloo: @4sage ur opinion is based on a loss to edg (which is top tier team)..please use some logic
