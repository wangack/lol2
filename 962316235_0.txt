[4:52:11] ye1l: Xiaohu was good as a midlaner
[4:52:22] ye1l: was cursed internationally
[4:52:33] ye1l: but we all remember the good back and forth he had against peak faker
[4:52:45] zzddcc: yeah
[4:52:52] zzddcc: miss UZI
[4:52:52] ye1l: he definitely got the better of peak faker in 2/5 games
[4:53:03] ye1l: which is more than almost any other midlaner in the world can say
[4:53:48] Frettlez: love the mmusic hahahah
[4:53:54] Frettlez: bangers
[4:53:57] ye1l: Thats also why I still hold perkz in high regard
[4:54:16] ye1l: since he absolutely held his own against peak faker
[4:54:32] Heisenptar: xiaohu is soooo much better as a toplaner he knows when to let cs go to help around  the map
[4:54:47] ye1l: dont really know
[4:55:03] ye1l: this is the first time that we actually see Xiaohu get every little resource from his team
[4:55:08] ye1l: before it was always all Uzi
[4:55:18] ye1l: its possible that he couldve done this as a midlaner if he got the chance
