[4:46:26] ye1l: Knight still laning exceptionally well, probably still the best in the league and 2nd best in the entire world as far as laning goes, but he's been kinda invisible outside of lane

[4:46:36] alucardhss: KonCha
[4:46:37] xythiera: @pyrokeith The problem is its a super hard and competitive work filled . Most peopl cant exeped that are just not good enoth .
[4:47:02] ye1l: c you all tomorrow
[4:47:02] l3vi1: @ye1l in actually in laning phase Rookie is still better than Knight
[4:47:06] vespergf: @xythiera yeah its very mentally taxing and theres a lot of work and luck in it. with scouting and competion
[4:47:13] xythiera: @ye1l Can i intresuce you to mister Chovey if you want to see world class
[4:47:22] Zachary_Blobman: @ye1l Laning showmaker then chovvy then knight for me

[4:47:49] xythiera: @ferrtits Chovey is better then Showmaker by far.
[4:47:55] ye1l: @xythiera there's a reason I said he wasn't #1 because Chovy is an unreal laner
[4:48:00] vespergf: @xythiera ima head off, have a good one bro. dont forget to eat and stay hydrated

[4:48:45] NicaMex: Is it over?
[4:48:50] ye1l: other players do other things better

[4:49:12] l3vi1: We still need a Rookie vs Chovy to judge who's best at laning phase
[4:49:16] xythiera: @ye1l Team down 100cs Chovey up 200xD
[4:49:25] Reftur: FPx lost?
[4:49:26] xythiera: @8ryankim Mooooooooo
[4:49:32] ye1l: but when it comes to controlling the wave and gaining consistent advantages in lane, Chovy is unreal
[4:49:56] xythiera: @ye1l And his out plays unreal
