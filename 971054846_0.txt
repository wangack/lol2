[0:40:56] keissah: jackey will gigga stomp viper for sure
[0:41:59] robinjacob: jackey > viper for sure
[0:42:41] LL_PiRAtE: Isnt it theyr team styles? EDG is the most preserved team or at least much more preserved than Top and Eventho thats the case Viper plays extremely risky and on the edge, so this argument of jackey being aggressive and viper being passive is just stupid
[0:43:55] LL_PiRAtE: Unless both play in TOP or EDG with the same rosters than we can compare
[0:44:13] uwunorth: chat who wins atom or ig?
[0:44:22] GosuBws: #RWWin
[0:44:33] keissah: @xoNial RA 60/40
[0:44:41] GosuBws: ig will take it
[0:44:48] GosuBws: they gonna clutch it out trust
[0:44:54] uwunorth: @keissah i was thinking atom too, they are the underdogs but theyve only really lost to top top teams
[0:45:00] shadow_typical: !schedule
[0:45:08] theshyrookie: when they play?
[0:45:16] keissah: yeah what im thinking, IG might pull the playoff buff game
[0:45:30] GosuBws: rookie might start trying
[0:46:22] keissah: losing jackeylove is huge in ig
[0:46:32] Fyrixia: Or the other side.. IG brings just what they did last year
[0:46:41] Fyrixia: And get 3-0 today
[0:46:48] Fyrixia: And season over
[0:46:52] keissah: did they qualify last worlds?
[0:47:22] jocelynyme: RA will win, if Dookie and TheShyt are showing up today KEKW
