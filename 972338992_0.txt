[3:02:33] TheOreoCupcake: Being the best ADC in the west is like being the most important kidney, there are only like 2 decent adc in the west.
[3:02:33] ejdowneygamer: @Zheruii Oh. I Think the new Volibear is most beutiful. @ratmustaforgot

[3:32:10] 蘇柏柏大濕: SN no.1
[3:32:10] Zachary_Blobman: Light usually the carry for LNG
[3:32:10] butters1584: Tarzan back to LCK and join Chovy KEKW
[3:32:12] flapperzzx: TARZAN FANBOIS KEKW
[3:32:17] LitoSheppard: the takeaway isnt how bad lng is. its been a 9 team league all season. its how good sn looks. they can be a real threat to top 4 with this sort of play

[3:32:55] richng98: yeah, Tarzan should go back to HLE, Chovy can't carry HLE
[3:32:56] Tossed_Six_Million: Icon lost lane against lvl 2 Kassadin even in gold this doesnt happen

[3:33:36] threshbin1: tarzan should back to chovy's esport
[3:33:37] randomtoplaner: @EU_AT_RlFT_RIVALS i think the concerning part was how alstar and sylas kept inting and going in 1vs 3 etc
