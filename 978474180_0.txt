[0:50:03] yukonplayer1: TSM, aka "Tribe of Silver Monkeys," is a team in Riot Games' Minor League that is often ridiculed for being washed-up and having an owner that looks like Wukong. It is specifically known for its obnoxious fanbase and mind-numbing throws.

[1:14:29] ye1l: I think this could honestly be a 3-0 in either direction, FPX snowballs so incredibly hard. Also Xiaohu was literally losing lane against 369 with 2 kills gifted to him and didn't start winning until he was gifted another 2 kills. There's definitely a possibility that FPX wins
